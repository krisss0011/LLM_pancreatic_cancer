Abstract— Radiopharmaceutical
therapies
(RPTs)
present a major opportunity to improve cancer therapy.
Although many current RPTs use the same injected
activity
for
all
patients,
there
is
interest
in
using
absorbed dose measurements to enable personalized
prescriptions. Image-based absorbed dose calculations
incur uncertainties from calibration factors, partial volume
effects
and
segmentation
methods.
While
previously
published dose estimation protocols incorporate these
uncertainties,
they
do
not
account
for
uncertainty
originating from the reconstruction process itself with
the propagation of Poisson noise from projection data.
This effect should be accounted for to adequately estimate
the total uncertainty in absorbed dose estimates. This
paper proposes a computationally practical algorithm
that propagates uncertainty from projection data through
clinical reconstruction algorithms to obtain uncertainties
on the total measured counts within volumes of interest
(VOIs). The algorithm is first validated on 177Lu and 225Ac
phantom data by comparing estimated uncertainties from
individual
SPECT
acquisitions
to
empirical
estimates
obtained from multiple acquisitions. It is then applied to (i)
Monte Carlo and (ii) multi-time point 177Lu-DOTATATE and
225Ac-PSMA-617 patient data for time integrated activity
(TIA) uncertainty estimation. The outcomes of this work
are two-fold: (i) the proposed uncertainty algorithm is
validated, and (ii) a blueprint is established for how the
algorithm can be inform dosimetry protocols via TIA
uncertainty estimation. The proposed algorithm is made
publicly available in the open-source image reconstruction
library PyTomography.

therapies
(RPTs)
are
rapidly advancing, with widespread use in clinical trials
and recent approvals for the treatment of several cancers.
177Lu-based RPTs, for example, have achieved significant
milestones in recent years. 177Lu-DOTATATE based peptide
receptor RPT gained food and drug administration approval in
2018 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumor patients [1].
Soon after, 177Lu-PSMA-617 was demonstrated efficacious in
the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer
(mCRPC) in the VISION [2] and TheraP [3] randomized
control trials. Numerous other clinical trials that focus on
other isotopes have also shown positive results. Notably,
recent studies on mCRPC RPTs have explored the use of
225Ac to enhance treatment outcomes [4]–[6].
SPECT imaging can be used to monitor therapy in the
aforementioned RPTs since photon emissions from direct
177Lu and indirect 225Ac decay are detectable by SPECT
cameras. Imaging can be used to perform dosimetry after an
initial therapeutic dose, with the goal of measuring absorbed
dose in tumours and critical organs to personalize administered
activity in later cycles of RPTs [7]. When images are used
to estimate absorbed dose, however, it may be important to
consider the impact of limited statistical counts (LSCs) in
projection data on the uncertainty in voxel values of the
reconstructed images. While previous protocols have reported
uncertainty analyses in RPT absorbed dose calculations [8]–
[10], these protocols do not consider uncertainties propagating
from LSCs in projection data.
In general, data obtained with any photon-based imaging
modality are affected by some (perhaps negligible) amount of
Poisson noise due to the finite number of photons detected.
The noise is particularly significant in emission tomography
due to the small number of photons detected, and it translates
into corresponding noise and uncertainty in reconstructed
images. Certain studies have aimed at quantifying these noise
properties [11], [12], while others have estimated noise via
modification of filtered back projection (FBP) algorithms [13],
[14], or bootstrapping (FBP and iterative) [15]. Barrett et al.
[16] derived an iterative technique to estimate uncertainty
propagation in the expectation maximization algorithm. Qi
[17] later presented a more general formalism for uncertainty
propagation in preconditioned gradient ascent (PGA) algo-
rithms.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XXXX 2023
These approaches by Barrett et al. and Qi, however, are
computationally expensive to directly implement on clinical
data due to large matrix-matrix products. The present work,
as such, presents an extension of Qi’s algorithm to make uncer-
tainly estimation computationally efficient by considering the
particular problem of total count uncertainty estimation within
volumes of interest (VOIs). In what follows, the theoretical
formalism is established, and the proposed algorithm is applied
the specific and important task of absorbed dose uncertainty
estimation in RPTs [18]. To facilitate the integration of the
proposed uncertainty estimation technique in such protocols,
the algorithm was implemented in the open-source image
reconstruction library PyTomography [19].
II. METHODS
This paper consists of three components: (i) derivation
of the proposed uncertainty algorithm (ii) validation of the
algorithm on physical 177Lu and 225Ac SPECT/CT phantom
data, and (iii) application of the algorithm on multiple time
point SPECT/CT imaging from 177Lu-DOTATATE and 225Ac-
PSMA-617 RPTs, with further applications in time activity
curve (TAC) fitting and time integrated activity (TIA) estima-
tion. All reconstructions and uncertainty estimations in this
paper were calculated with PyTomography [19].
A. Theory
There are a few mathematical conventions used in this paper.
The following notation is used for random variables: if x is a
random variable, then ˆx corresponds to an analytically derived
estimator for x while ˜x corresponds to an empirical estimate
of x obtained by repetition of experiments. Uncertainties of
an estimator are also estimators, and may be denoted by ˆu(ˆx),
ˆu(˜x), ˜u(ˆx), or ˜u(˜x) depending on whether they are analytically
or empirically obtained. The covariance matrix for a random
variable x consisting of more than one element is denoted
Σx. The corresponding percent uncertainties are defined as
δ(x) ≡u(x)/x·100%, where the carets are omitted here. The
following notation is used for vectors: · corresponds to the
dot product, ⊙corresponds to the Hadamard or element-wise
product, and v◦α corresponds to Hadamard or element-wise
power of all elements in vector v to the power α. A primed
linear operator A′ represents the transpose of linear operator
A.
1) VOI Uncertainty Estimation Formalism: The random vec-
tor of the acquired data y can be decomposed into an expec-
tation value ¯y and zero-mean noise vector n as
y = ¯y + n
(1)
A reconstruction algorithm A uses this projection data to
obtain an image estimate ˆx via
ˆx = A(y)
(2)
Since y is random vector, so too is ˆx; hence ˆx can be written
as
ˆx = ¯ˆx + ϵ
(3)
where ϵ is a zero-mean random noise vector. ϵ corresponds
to an uncertainty resulting solely from uncertainty in the
projection data. All information about ϵ is contained in Σϵ,
which depends on A and Σn. Provided Σϵ can be estimated
using some estimator ˆΣϵ, the uncertainty on the sum of voxel
values within a volume of interest (VOI) mask ξ can be
estimated as
ˆu(ˆx · ξ) =
q
ξ′ ˆΣϵξ
(4)
When expressed in the form of 4, it is clear that ˆΣϵ can
be interpreted as an operator (much like the system matrix),
and thus the individual components need not all be computed
when operating on a specific VOI mask χ. In what follows,
the relationship between ˆΣϵ and ˆΣn is established for various
reconstruction algorithms A.
2) Covariance Matrix Estimation: The most common linear
reconstruction algorithm is filtered back projection (FBP). Us-
ing the distributive property of linear reconstruction algorithms
and equation 2, the relationship between ϵ and n can be shown
to be given simply by
ϵ = An
(5)
implying
ˆΣϵ = AˆΣnA′
(6)
Uncertainty estimation for linear reconstruction algorithms
thus requires (i) an estimate for the covariance of the acquired
data ˆΣn and (ii) action of the adjoint A′ on ξ in Eq. 4.
However, the majority of presently used tomographic re-
construction algorithms for image quantification are iterative
in nature, and thus propagation of noise estimation is not
straightforward. Barrett et al. [16] derived an iterative tech-
nique to estimate uncertainty propagation in the EM algorithm.
Meanwhile, many presently used iterative algorithms (e.g.
EM) are actually a particular form of preconditioned gradient
ascent (PGA) algorithms, and a framework for uncertainty
propagation in PGA algorithms was in fact proposed by
Qi [17]. PGA algorithms in image reconstruction have the
following form:

(7)
where ˆxk is the image estimate of the kth iteration, H
is the system matrix for the imaging system, D(H) is a
positive definite matrix, L(y|ˆxk, H) is the likelihood function
characterizing the projection data y, s is a an additive term
used to account for scatter (in SPECT) and random/scatter
(in PET), U(ˆxk) is a regularization function, and β is a
scaling factor. Using the results from Qi [17] and including
the estimated scatter uncertainty σ, it follows that

Using (8) and the fact that n and σ are independent, an
estimator for the covariance matrix of xk can be derived as
ˆΣϵk = ˆV k
y ˆΣn[ ˆV k
y ]′ + V k
s ˆΣσ[ ˆV k
s ]′
(12)
where ˆV corresponds to substitution of ˆxk, y, and ˆs for
¯ˆxk, ¯y, and ¯s respectively in Eqs. 11 and 10. The form
of ˆBk
z and ˆQk in for the Poisson likelihood function are
shown for ordered subset expectation maximization [20] and
block sequential regularized expectation maximization [21]
in Tab. I. For uncorrelated Poisson data, representative of
what is measured in SPECT/PET, the covariance matrix of
the photopeak is estimated by
ˆΣn = {y}
(13)
In SPECT, the triple energy window method [22] is used to
estimate scatter via ˆs = Ks[wlsl + wusu] where wl and wu
are weightings for data acquired in different energy windows
sl and su, and Ks is a Gaussian smoothing kernel often used
when scatter data is sparse. In this case
ˆΣσ = K′

Substituting Eqs. 13, 14, and 16 into 12 and combining with
Eq. 4, it follows that

where Vy and Vs are specified by Eq. 9. For PET, where
the scatter is estimated via single scatter simulation or Monte
Carlo, and the resulting profile is smooth, the scatter term can
be neglected.
Often in low count scenarios, a post-reconstruction filter is
applied to a reconstructed image to reduce noise. In general, if
a linear operator Lp is applied to a reconstructed image, then
ϵ →Lpϵ
=⇒Σϵ →LpΣϵL′
p
(16)
Based on Eqs. 4 and 15, consideration of this additional
operation amounts to substitution of ξ with L′
pξ in Eq. 15.
In this regard, post-reconstruction image filtering translates to
pre uncertainty estimation mask filtering.
Eq. 15 is an extension of Qi’s technique (Eq. 12) that
that reduces computation time by considering matrix-vector
products instead of matrix-matrix products. While it yields
less information than a complete covariance matrix between
all voxel pairs, it yields information that is particularly well
suited to estimate the uncertainty of time integrated activity
(TIA) for dosimetry application.
3) Time Integrated Activity: This section demonstrates how
the error estimation technique in the previous section can be
used for dosimetry: in particular, how to determine uncertain-
ties in the time integrated activity (TIA) for a specific VOI.
The TIA in a VOI is defined as
A =
Z ∞
0
f(t, p)dt
(17)
where f(t, p) is a function that describes the time activity
curve. The TAC curve parameters p = [p1, ..., pq] are esti-
mated via fitting n data points (ti, Ai) using non-linear re-
gression techniques to minimize χ2 = P[(Ai −f(ti, p))/σi]2
where ti is the time, Ai ≡ˆxi·ξ is the voxel sum within a VOI,
and σi ≡ˆu(ˆxi · ξ) is the estimated uncertainty. The estimated
TIA is given by
ˆ
A = g(ˆp), where g is some function of the fit
parameters. Since the estimated fit parameters ˆp depend on the
random variables Ai (with uncertainty characterized by σi), it
follows that
ˆ
A is itself a random variable; its true uncertainty
can be defined as u( ˆ
A ).
The estimated covariance matrix of the fit parameters ˆV is
assumed implicitly to be a function of the fit ˆp, and can be
used to obtain an estimate for u( ˆ
A ) via
ˆu( ˆ
A ) = (∇pg)′ ˆV (∇pg)

p=ˆp
(18)
The fit functions f, along with the corresponding g and ∇pg
used for various VOIs in this paper are shown in Tab. II.
The provided values of σi in curve fitting will impact the
estimates ˆp and ˆV . There are three different ways to provide
the σi in curve fitting:
1) Use of the estimated σi. In the context of TAC fitting,
this involves using the uncertainties obtained from Eq.
15. The corresponding curve fit estimates ˆp(est-sig) and
ˆV (est-sig) yield TIA and TIA uncertainty estimates of
ˆ
A (est-sig) and ˆu(est-sig)( ˆ
A (est-sig)).
2) Use of “proportional” values σi/c in place of σi where
c > 0 is an a priori unknown proportionality constant.
For algorithms insensitive to scaling of χ2, ˆp(prop-sig) =
ˆp(est-sig), and the covariance matrix can be estimated as
ˆV (prop-sig)({σi}) =
 1
ˆc2

ˆV (est-sig)({σi/c})
=
n −q
χ2

ˆV (est-sig)({σi/c})
(19)
where ˆV ({σi/c}) results from use of σi/c in a curve
fitting procedure. These yield TIA and TIA uncertainty
estimates of
ˆ
A (prop-sig) and ˆu(prop-sig)( ˆ
A (prop-sig))
3) Use σi = 1 for all i. This is equivalent to providing
equally weighted proportional uncertainties for each data
point. The corresponding estimates ˆp(no-sig) and ˆV (no-sig)
yield TIA and TIA uncertainty estimates of
ˆ
A (no-sig) and
ˆu(no-sig)( ˆ
A (no-sig)) respectively.
It is demonstrated in the appendix that the count variance
in mask ξj at different counts is approximately given by

σi ≈cj (xi · ξj)1/2
(20)
where cj is a proportionality factor for VOI j. In this case,
ˆu(prop-sig)( ˆ
A ) can be obtained by using σi/c = (xi · ξ)1/2
in Eq. 19, and Eq. 15 is not needed. As will be shown in
the subsequent sections, however, the reliance on ˆc in Eq. 19
results in significantly reduced precision compared to using of
the estimated uncertainties. Furthermore, Eq. 19 is unusable
for any case where n ≤q (e.g. a two time point fit to any curve
with two or more parameters). In this scenario, estimation of
u( ˆ
A ) requires σi directly, so the uncertainties provided by
Eq. 15 must be used.
B. Validation and Clinical Application
1) Phantom-Based Validation of Uncertainty Estimation: In
what follows, the uncertainty estimation technique is validated
for SPECT with NEMA phantom data reconstructed using two
popular reconstruction protocols: (i) OSEM and (ii) BSREM
with the relative difference penalty (RDP) [23]. OSEM with
one subset is denoted as maximum likelihood expectation
maximum (MLEM). In particular, the estimated percent un-
certainty, given by
ˆδ(ˆxk · ξ) = ˆu(ˆxk · ξ)
ˆxk · ξ
(21)
is compared to the empirical uncertainty estimator obtained
by taking multiple acquisitions in sequence:
˜δ(ˆxk · ξ) =

wiˆxk
i · ξ; 1 ≤i ≤N
	
Mean(

wiˆxk
i · ξ; 1 ≤i ≤N
	
)
(22)
where i is the acquisition index, N is the total number of
acquisitions taken, and wi is an exponential scalar weighting
factor used to compensate for activity decay over the course
of multiple repeated acquisitions.
For 177Lu, a NEMA phantom with spheres of diameter
37 mm, 28 mm, 22 mm, 17 mm, 13 mm, and 10 mm was
filled with a 9:1 source to background ratio with sphere activity
concentration of 0.89 MBq/mL. Fifty-three SPECT acquisi-
tions of the phantom were taken in sequence on a Siemens
Symbia T2 system with the following settings: 128 × 128
pixels at 4.82 mm×4.82 mm resolution, 96 projection angles,
medium energy collimators, and 15 s acquisition time per
projection. Acquired energy windows are shown in Tab. III.
The data were reconstructed using (i) OSEM with 8 subsets
and up to 10 iterations, and (ii) BSREM and the relative
difference penalty (RDP) (β = 0.3, γ = 2) with 8 subsets
and up to 40 iterations. Eight regions were considered for
uncertainty estimation: the six spheres in the NEMA phantom,
a background VOI consisting of two 50 mm diameter spheres
drawn in the warm region, and the central cold cylinder
portion of the phantom. Sample reconstructions, estimated
uncertainties, and true uncertainties for these use cases are
shown in Fig. 1.

Spheres of diameters 60 mm, 37 mm, and 28 mm were
filled at 1.37 kBq/mL and placed in the phantom with a 10:1
source to background ratio. Thirty-four SPECT acquisitions
of the phantom were taken in sequence on a Siemens Symbia
T2 system with the following settings: 128 × 128 pixels at
4.82 mm × 4.82 mm resolution, 96 projection angles, high

energy collimators, and 60 s acquisition time per projection
with energy windows corresponding to gamma emission from
221Fr and 213Bi as indicated in Tab. III. To create clinically
realistic scenarios, the projection angles were sub sampled
to 32 angles post acquisition. In addition to reconstructing
each photopeak separately, joint dual photopeak (JDP) recon-
struction was also used, which used a stacked system matrix
considering both peaks simultaneously (see H. Li in [24]). In
each case, the data were reconstructed using MLEM for up
to 100 iterations. The VOIs masking the three spheres were
considered for uncertainty estimation. Sample reconstructions,
empirical uncertainties, and analytical uncertainties for these
use cases are shown in Fig. 2.
2) Dosimetry Simulation and Validation: The following sec-
tion considers propagation of uncertainty from VOIs (Eq. 12)
to TIA (Eq. 18) in both 177Lu and 225Ac imaging. The ex-
amples consist of using the anthropomorphic XCAT phantom
[25] in Monte Carlo simulations, where activity dynamics are
defined to be analogous to the patient examples considered
later. The true “empirical” variance ˜u( ˆ
A ) obtained from TIA
estimates of multiple SPECT noise realizations is compared to
the estimated “analytical” variances ˆu( ˆ
A ) derived from single
noise realizations.
An XCAT phantom was configured, analogous to the patient
examples considered later, to have the following important
regions: background, left kidney, right kidney, liver, a large,
medium, and small liver lesion, bone lesions in the left and
right hip bones. The organ biodistribution followed the mono-
exponential curves in Tab. II, while the liver and bone lesions
followed the bi-exponential curves in Tab. II. The activity
concentration ratios between the
225Ac and
177Lu XCAT
phantoms were 1:1000, corresponding to typical differences
in injected activities between these isotopes.
Monte Carlo SPECT acquisition was performed in SI-
MIND [26], where the scanner was representative of a typical
Siemens Symbia T Series scanner. In particular, it contained
a 9.5 mm (3/8”) thick NaI scintillator crystal with 3.8 mm
FWHM intrinsic spatial resolution and 10% energy reso-
lution at 140 keV (and 1/
√
E dependence). For 177Lu, a
“medium energy” parallel hole collimator with a hole length
of 40.64 mm and hole diameter of 2.94 mm was used, and
96 projections were acquired for 15 s each. For 225Ac, a
“high energy” parallel hole collimator with hole length of
59.70 mm and hole diameter of 4.00 mm was used, and 32
projections were acquired for 150 s each. Both simulations
used a 0.4795 cm pixel size with a projection matrix size of
128 × 240 in order to capture the full field of view, and a
constant radial distance of 22 cm. Acquired energy windows
are shown in Tab. III. Noiseless projections were obtained and
used to generate 100 independent realizations (177Lu) and 20
independent realizations (225Ac) for each time point of each
isotope.
The time points considered for 177Lu were selected as 4 h,
28 h, 103 h, and 124 h to be consistent with subsequent
patient examples; all 400 realizations were reconstructed using
OSEM (4it8ss). The time points considered for 225Ac were
6 h, 21 h, 77 h, and 285 h to be consistent with subsequent
patient examples. Reconstruction used a JDP system matrix;
the upper peak employed a PSF model derived from SIMIND
Monte Carlo data with the SPECTPSFToolbox [27], while
the lower peak used standard Gaussian PSF modeling. All
80 realizations were reconstructed with MLEM (100it1ss +
3 cm Gaussian post filtering). The images were scaled by (i)
calibration factors (CFs) obtained via a point source simulation
in SIMIND to convert counts to units of activity and (ii) by
applying partial volume correction using measured recovery
coefficients (RCs); the RCs were obtained by reconstructing
corresponding noiseless projection data at each time point and
computing the ratio of measured to true uptake in each VOI.
Because many counts were simulated, the RCs and CFs had
negligible uncertainties; this was done intentionally so that
uncertainties in the TIA were purely due to Poisson noise in
the projection data. Analytical uncertainties were estimated in
all VOIs for each noise realization of each isotope.
For the following, let j represent the time point index, m
represent the VOI index, and i represent the noise realization
index. Each set of four times points {tj, Aj, σj}i,m were fit
to the functions specified by Tab. II using the Trust Region
Reflective algorithm available in the “curve fit” function of
scipy. The curve fitting was performed three separate ways to
obtain the estimates ˆu(no-sig)( ˆ
A (no-sig)
i,m
), ˆu(prop-sig)( ˆ
A (prop-sig)
i,m
),
and ˆu(est-sig)( ˆ
A (est-sig)
i,m
) respectively. The distribution of each
these uncertainties (across i and for each m) was compared
to the corresponding empirical estimates ˜u(no-sig)( ˆ
A (no-sig)
m
),
˜u(prop-sig)( ˆ
A (prop-sig)
m
), and ˜u(est-sig)( ˆ
A (est-sig)
m
) of the uncertainty
obtained by computing the variance of each of the Ai,m across
the noise realizations i.
3) Clinical Applications: The uncertainty formalism was ap-
plied to two use cases on real patient data. In each case, Eq.
15 was used to obtain uncertainty estimates in VOIs at various
time points, which were then used to compute the uncertainty
on the TIA given by Eq. 18.
The first use case explored reconstruction of multi time
point 177Lu-DOTATATE RPT data from the University of
Michigan Deep Blue data sharing repository [28]–[30]. The
patient considered was imaged on the day of injection, as
well as 1, 4, and 5 days post-injection. Images were acquired
on a Siemens Intevo system with a 128 × 128 matrix size
and 120 projections with 25 s acquisition time per projection;
acquired energy windows are shown in Tab. III. To study the
effect of different numbers of acquired counts, the data were
subsampled into the following three cases: (i) 120 projections
at 25 s / projection, (ii) 60 projections at 5 s / projection,
and (iii) 30 projections at 1.2 s / projection. P data were
reconstructed using OSEM (12it/8ss) for case (i), OSEM
(24it/4ss) for case (ii), and OSEM (48it/1ss) for case (iii). In
each case, five VOIs were considered for uncertainty analysis
the left/right kidney and small/medium/large liver lesions;
volumes were obtained by drawing VOIs that captured all
counts from each lesion. Sample reconstructed MIPs and TACs
are shown in Fig. 5, while explicit TIA and TIA uncertainty
estimates for each case are shown in 6.
The second use case explored uncertainty estimation in bone
metastasis of a patient receiving 225Ac-PSMA-617 therapy.
The patient received an activity of 8 MBq and was imaged
6
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XXXX 2023
6 h, 20.5 h, 76.5 h, and 284.6 h post injection on a GE
Discovery 670 Pro SPECT/CT system. 30 projections (15 per
head) were acquired for 150 s / projection; acquired energy
windows are shown in Tab. III. A GE high energy general
purpose collimator was used for image acquisition.
Reconstruction used a JDP system matrix; the upper peak
employed a PSF model derived from SIMIND Monte Carlo
data with the SPECTPSFToolbox [31], while the lower peak
used standard Gaussian PSF modeling. To account for stray
radiation-related noise due to the low count rate, a blank
scan was taken using the same acquisition parameters, and
the mean background counts in each energy window was
taken into consideration in reconstruction. Images at each
time point were reconstructed via MLEM (100it) with a 3 cm
post-reconstruction filter using (i) the 218 keV peak, (ii) the
440 keV peak, and (iii) using both peaks simultaneously.
For (iii), the relative primary rates between the peaks was
estimated by simulating a point source with a similar imaging
system in SIMIND.
Three lesions were segmented by a physician on a pre-
treatment PET image using the PET Edge+ tool of MIM v7.2.1
(MIM Software Inc., USA), and were used as VOI masks
for estimating uncertainty via Eq. 15. The four time points
were fitted to the lesion activity fit function in Tab. II, and
the uncertainty on the TIA was estimated using Eq. 18 with
ˆV (est-sig).
III. RESULTS
A. Uncertainty Estimation Validation
The results of the 177Lu phantom study are shown in Fig.
1. In all regions, the computed analytical uncertainty were
consistent with the empirically obtained uncertainty estimates,
providing support for Eq. 15 in this activity regime. For
OSEM, the uncertainties increased with more iterations and
smaller volumes, while for BSREM-RDP, the uncertainties
tended to converge in all regions after a few iterations, with
smaller regions yielding larger uncertainties after convergence.
The uncertainties in BSREM were smaller than OSEM for the
small spheres after many iterations.
The results of the 225Ac phantom study are shown in Fig. 2.
For reconstruction using the 440 keV peak and the dual peak,
computed analytical uncertainties had little variance between
different acquisitions, and their estimates were consistent with
the empirically estimate uncertainties. Reconstruction using
the 218 keV yielded analytical uncertainties with significant
variance in the small (±22.8%) and medium (±8.9%) spheres,
likely due to the smaller count rate in this energy window.
B. Dosimetry Simulation and Validation
Figs. 3 and 4 show the results of the Monte Carlo dosimetry
validation study. For all VOIs considered, use of the uncer-
tainties given by Eq. 15 in TAC fitting yielded accurate TIA
uncertainty predictions with significantly improved precision
relative to use of (i) proportional uncertainties given by Eq. 19
and (ii) no uncertainties. In both isotopes, the uncertainty on
the TIA was larger in regions modeled by a bi-exponential. For
example, although the large lesion had greater activity than the

left kidney at every time point in the 177Lu simulation, it also
had a larger estimated TIA uncertainty of (0.817 ± 0.014)%
(vs. (0.404 ± 0.001)%). In the 225Ac case, the covariance on
the parameters for the right and left hip bone lesions could
not be estimated using no and proportional uncertainties; this
is elaborated upon in the discussion section.
C. Clinical Applications
Sample reconstructions and TACs for the 177Lu case with
120 projections and 25 s / projection are shown in Fig. 5. TIA
and TIA uncertainty plots for all three subsampled acquisition
times are shown in Fig. 6. The uncertainties in the kidney TIAs
were small (< 3%), even when the projection time is reduced
from 25 s / projection to 1.2 s / projection. The uncertainty
in the three liver lesions increased more substantially as the
time per projection was reduced, increasing from 1.26% (25 s /
projection) to 5.11% (1.2 s / projection) in the smallest lesion.
In general, the TIA error became larger with smaller volumes.
Despite the large lesion having a TIA three times greater than
the left kidney, its TIA uncertainty was similar, likely due to
the larger number of TAC parameters (2 for mono-exponential
vs. 3 for bi-exponential).
Sample reconstructions and TACs for the 225Ac case with
dual peak reconstruction are shown in Fig. 7. TIA and TIA
uncertainty plots for lesions in the pelvis and sacrum are
shown in Fig. 8. Though the dual peak TIA uncertainties were
always smallest, the estimated uncertainties of 9.84%, 23.90%,

and 13.73% in the three lesions were significantly larger than
in the 177Lu example.
IV. DISCUSSION
The VOI-based uncertainty technique of Eq. 15 was tested
on 177Lu and 225Ac SPECT phantom data (and 18F PET
phantom data in the appendix) by comparing uncertainty
estimations from single acquisitions to empirical uncertainty
estimates given by the variation across multiple acquisitions.
The method was validated for both the OSEM and BSREM-
RDP reconstruction algorithms. It was shown consistent with
the empirical estimates in nearly all regions, with the exception
of those with very low activity. Estimated uncertainties from

uncertainties are thus not shown.

Eq. 15 were then used in TAC fitting from Monte Carlo
SPECT simulations. It was demonstrated that their use yielded
accurate TIA uncertainty estimates with far greater precision
than (i) use of no uncertainty and (ii) use of proportional
uncertainties of VOI activity. For 177Lu, the TIA uncertainty
estimates had better precision in regions with biodistributions
modeled by mono-exponential biokinetics (compared to bi-
exponential) due to the smaller number of model parameters
in curve fitting. For 225Ac, TIA uncertainties could only be
estimated for bone lesions if Eq. 15 was used; since there were
only slightly more data points than curve fit parameters, the
under-constrained problem yielded near zero values for χ2 and
thus unstable estimates in Eq. 19. This further highlights the
importance of the proposed method, since there may be cases
where TIA uncertainty cannot be estimated unless the LSC
uncertainty is known at each time point. Finally, the method
was applied to real clinical data to demonstrate the range of
expected TIA uncertainties in 177Lu-DOTATATE and 225Ac-
PSMA-617 imaging.

There are a few noteworthy observations from the validation
section. The predicted analytical uncertainties were generally
consistent with the empirical uncertainties, except in regions
with low activity such as (i) the small and medium spheres for
225Ac (218 keV peak) and (ii) the cold cylinder for 18F from
Fig. 10 in the appendix. In these regions, the variance of the
analytical uncertainties was large, highlighting that the method
failed for certain noise realizations. In Fig. 2, the displayed
225Ac low count 218 keV peak image (which corresponds to
a particular noise realization) had almost no activity predicted
in the small sphere: this impacted the uncertainty estimation
algorithm. These results do not invalidate the theory, however,
since they are evidently scenarios where use of ˆxk as a proxy
for ¯ˆxk in Eq. (12) fails. These extreme cases demonstrate the
limitations of the derived uncertainty technique. For 177Lu and
18F, OSEM resulted in higher VOI uncertainties than BSREM-
Fig. 8.

photopeak, which uses both peaks simultaneously.
RDP. Regularized algorithms, however, resulted in VOIs with
smaller RCs and greater activity leakage from outside regions.
These larger systematic errors need to be considered against
the smaller LSC uncertainties.
A minor limitation of the SPECT phantom experiments is
that the activity of 177Lu and 225Ac decreased throughout the
repeated acquisitions that each spanned over 24 hours. While
the counts in each VOI were scaled by an exponential scalar
weighting in Eq. 22 to remove the component of variation
resulting from activity decay, it was assumed that the relative
uncertainties in each VOI remained approximately constant
over time. In practice, the uncertainty at later time points
may be slightly higher due to the reduced number of counts
measured.
The curve fitting validation also has limitations that may
not have been addressed here. In the XCAT simulation, the
time dependent distribution of activity truly followed mono-
exponential and bi-exponential distributions before simulation
of the SPECT acquisition. In a real clinical scenario, there may
be sources of uncertainty in the true organ activity, perhaps
related to stochastic biological phenomena. These additional
sources of uncertainty, which are separate from the imaging
system, would need to be accounted for when estimating the
covariance matrix of the TAC parameters. Future research
might aim to consider these sources of uncertainty in Monte
Carlo simulations and determine the importance of including
these uncertainties in TAC fitting.
While uncertainty propagation in scaling the TIA by the
system CFs is straightforward since the uncertainties can be
added in quadrature after TAC fitting, propagation of uncer-
tainty in RCs may be more nuanced, since each time point may
have a separate RC dependent on the surrounding activity. In
this case, each individual time point would need to be scaled
by a separate RC before curve fitting, and the uncertainty
would need to be included in the curve fitting procedure. If the
same RC is used for every time point, however, then recovery
correction can be applied directly to the TIA after TAC fitting.
Another potential issue is correlation between VOI segmen-
tations and estimated uncertainties from SPECT images. If
VOIs are segmented solely using external images, such as CT
or PET, then no such correlation would exist. However, if
activity distributions were used to guide segmentations, then
SPECT noise realizations (and any associated estimated uncer-
tainty from Eq. 15) are correlated with VOI segmentation; this
would need to be accounted for in dose uncertainty protocols.
While consideration of these factors is beyond the scope of
AUTHOR et al.: PREPARATION OF PAPERS FOR IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
9
this paper, they are of high priority in future studies.
The application of Eq. 15 for real data TIA uncertainty
estimation was meant to demonstrate the feasibility of this
technique in dosimetry use cases. In the 177Lu-DOTATATE
example, all VOI uncertainties for the standard imaging pro-
tocol (25 s / projection) are small relative to other uncertainties
in the dosimetry pipeline, such as those propagating from
RCs and CFs (8.2% (medium lesion) and 6.6% (Symbia T2)
respectively in Nuttens et. al. [9]). For the 225Ac-PSMA-617
RPT use case, it is demonstrated in Fig. 8 that use of dual
peak reconstruction yields the lowest uncertainty in the TIA.
It should be emphasized that the TIA estimates in Fig. 8 still
need to be adjusted based on RCs, which may potentially be
different for the 218 keV, 440 keV, and dual energy window
reconstructions separately. Since the estimated uncertainties of
9.84%, 23.90%, and 13.73% for the three lesions are substan-
tial compared to RC and CF uncertainties from Nuttens et. al.
[9], it follows that the uncertainty estimation technique derived
here is essential to account for all sources of uncertainty in
225Ac dosimetry.
Future studies should aim to study the impact of including
the proposed uncertainty method in a full dosimetry protocol.
Furthermore, although the TIA uncertainties may be relatively
insignificant for standard imaging times for 177Lu RPTs, they
could be used to find patient specific minimum scan time
requirements. For example, data from the first time point of
an RPT procedure can be sub-sampled and used to establish
a relationship between computed uncertainty and projection
time in relevant VOIs, and used to create a minimum bound
on the required acquisition time for the patient in subsequent
scans.
V. CONCLUSION
In emission tomography, uncertainty propagates from the
Poisson-distributed random counts in the projection data to
reconstructed images. This work proposed a computationally
efficient algorithm to estimate the uncertainty on measured
counts from volumes of interest in reconstructed images. The
algorithm was validated by acquiring repeated
177Lu and
225Ac SPECT scans of a physical phantom, and demonstrating
that the variability of total counts in select volumes of interest
across multiple acquisitions was consistent with the estimated
uncertainties obtained from a single acquisition. Monte Carlo
simulations demonstrated that use of the estimated uncertain-
ties in time activity curve fitting and time integrated activity
estimation yield uncertainty estimates that are more accurate
and precise than conventional methods that use uncertainties
proportional to square root of counts. For 225Ac-PSMA-617
patient data, application of the algorithm demonstrated that
uncertainty in the projection data contributes significantly to
uncertainty on time integrated activity, and that this uncertainty
is large relative to other uncertainties attained in dosimetry. In
summary, this work has provided (i) validation of proposed
uncertainty algorithm and (ii) a blueprint for how the algorithm
can be applied in dosimetry protocols. The algorithm has been
implemented in the open source python library PyTomography
to maximize outreach to the nuclear medicine community.

A. Regional Count Variability
To justify the claim made by Eq. 20, the count standard
deviation in the kidneys and liver lesions for separate noise
realizations of the
177Lu-PSMA-617 XCAT simulation is
plotted as a function of the total VOI counts in Fig. 9. Each set
of data were fit to the functional form σ = c√ˆx · ξ where c is
a proportionality factor. As demonstrated, the proportionality
exists, but is different for each VOI.

simulations.
B. PET Application
The uncertainty method was also validated for PET re-
constructions using publicly available 18F NEMA phantom
data [32] acquired on a GE Discovery MI scanner (this
is a proof-of-concept assessment, and can be extended to
different applications in PET imaging such as 90Y dosimetry
). The acquired listmode data were split into 20 equally sized
sets; each subset was reconstructed, and uncertainties were
estimated for each of the six NEMA spheres, a VOI in the
background, and the central cold cylinder portion of the phan-
tom. Scatter and normalization for each list mode event was
obtained using the GE vendor software Duetto, while images
were reconstructed and errors estimated using PyTomography.
Sample reconstructions, analytical uncertainties, and estimated
uncertainties for these use cases are shown in Fig. 10. Results
are elaborated in the discussion.
