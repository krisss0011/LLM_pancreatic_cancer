ABSTRACT 
Fluorescence imaging allows for non-invasively visualizing and measuring key physiological 
parameters like pH and dissolved oxygen. In our work, we created two ratiometric fluorescent 
microsensors designed for accurately tracking dissolved oxygen levels in 3D cell cultures. We 
developed a simple and cost-effective method to produce hybrid core-shell silica 
microparticles that are biocompatible and versatile. These sensors incorporate oxygen-
sensitive probes (Ru(dpp) or PtOEP) and reference dyes (RBITC or A647 NHS-Ester). SEM 
analysis confirmed efficient loading and distribution of the sensing dye on the outer shell. 
Fluorimetric and CLSM tests demonstrated the sensors' reversibility and high sensitivity to

oxygen, even when integrated into 3D scaffolds. Aging and bleaching experiments validated the 
stability of our hybrid core-shell silica microsensors for 3D monitoring. The Ru(dpp)-RBITC 
microparticles showed the most promising performance, especially in a pancreatic cancer 
model using alginate microgels. By employing computational segmentation, we generated 3D 
oxygen maps during live cell imaging, revealing oxygen gradients in the extracellular matrix and 
indicating a significant decrease in oxygen levels characteristic of solid tumors. Notably, after 
12 hours, the oxygen concentration dropped to a hypoxic level of PO2 2.7 ± 0.1%. 
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Oxygen is an indispensable for cellular functions, playing a pivotal role in energy production 
and cellular signalling. It acts as the final electron acceptor in mitochondrial respiration and is 
a critical substrate for various enzymatic reactions involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, 
lipids, and other cellular components.1 Additionally, oxygen serves as a key regulator of cellular 
signalling pathways. Indeed, dysregulation of oxygen homeostasis is implicated in various 
diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions.2, 3 Solid 
tumor microenvironments are characterized by hypoxia, nutrient depletion, increased 
stiffness, and acidosis due to poor vasculature.4, 5 Understanding the molecular mechanisms 
of the hypoxic microenvironment is crucial for the development of new targeted therapeutic 
protocols. Over the years, a variety of analytical methods have been developed for quantifying 
oxygen levels in biological systems, ranging from direct to indirect measurements of oxygen-
sensitive parameters. Direct methods involve sensing dissolved oxygen directly in the sample 
and include Clark-type electrodes6 and metabolic analyzers like the Seahorse Extracellular 
Flux Analyzer (Seahorse XF Analyzer, Agilent).7 However, these approaches only provide 
mediated oxygen concentration measurements, and their bulk analysis does not assess the 
heterogeneity of oxygen distribution in tissues or 3D cell systems. Moreover, electrodes have 
limited applications due to their physical invasiveness,8 while the Seahorse XF Analyzer 
necessitates dedicated instruments and kits, making its use relatively niche due to cost 
considerations. Indirect methods encompass imaging techniques like magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI)9 and mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ fluorescence imaging,10-13 which enable 
measurement of oxygen distribution at the cellular scale. However, these approaches are 
indirect analyses; they do not directly measure oxygen itself but instead assess oxygen-
dependent parameters that provide insights into oxygen consumption in living specimens.

Nanotechnology has introduced novel tools for the direct, real-time measurement of PO2 with 
micron-scale spatial resolution. They offer advantages like non-invasiveness, enhanced 
sensitivity for monitoring of oxygen distribution within tissues and in vitro systems14 and include 
micro/nano optical sensors that exploit phosphorescent or fluorescent oxygen-sensitive 
probes to directly quantify oxygen levels in biological samples.4 In this study, we optimized a 
versatile synthetic approach for producing optical ratiometric microsensors. The 
straightforward chemistry and sensor architecture ensure easy customization to fit different 
image settings, enabling automatic and accurate 3D oxygen tracking at the cellular level, even 
with less advanced imaging setups. These optical sensors are ratiometric, allowing their use 
with confocal or FLIM/PLIM technology. While fluorescence lifetime imaging offers greater 
accuracy than emission intensity analyses, it has drawbacks such as cost and the need for 
dedicated units,15 moreover high power pulsed laser sources required by FLIM/PLIM can induce 
photobleaching and phototoxicity.16 Additionally, image acquisition and analysis can be time-
consuming,17 making it less convenient for 3D time-lapse live imaging compared to the 
ratiometric approach, which shows to be  more practical.18 Lastly, our synthetic approach 
facilitates an easy scaling up, as the process is conducted in the same reactor at room 
temperature, using only ethanol and water as main solvents. Silica was selected as the core 
material for its inertness, biocompatibility, and the versatility to tailor its morphology and size 
from the nano- to the microscale. Utilizing a modified Stöber method,19-21 we produced 
microparticles for the assembly of oxygen sensors, with the added flexibility of successful 
nanoparticle production. Opting for microparticles facilitated tracking extracellular oxygen 
gradients, allowing precise visualization and automated image segmentation during confocal 
imaging22, 23. The silica particles were additionally labelled with a reference dye such as 
Rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBITC) or Alexa Fluor™ 647 NHS Ester (Alexa647), meanwhile, 
oxygen-sensitive complexes were encapsulated within an outer shell of oxygen-permeable 
poly(dimethylsiloxane) hydroxy terminated (PDMS-OH). In particular, we selected tris(4,7-
diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) 
dichloride 
(Ru(dpp)) 
and 
Platinum(II) 
octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) as sensing dyes because Ruthenium(II) complexes were 
extensively studied due to their optical performances,24-26 customizable structures and

fluorescence/phosphorescence upon interaction with molecular oxygen or reactive oxygen 
species,33, 34 a characteristic shared with other metal-organic complexes of transition metals 
and metalloporphyrins.6, 35-39 The incorporation of an outer PDMS-OH layer resulted effective in 
overcoming solubility limitations of the sensing dyes as well as avoiding their leaching, while 
guaranteeing oxygen permeability. Metal-organic complexes are often too hydrophilic40 to cross 
cellular membranes, restricting their application to the extracellular environment, while some 
metalloporphyrins are too hydrophobic41, 42 to be solubilized in aqueous media. This strategy 
not only adjusted the solubility of oxygen probes but also optimized their loading capacity, 
offering the potential to encapsulate other relevant oxygen sensing dyes such as

RBITC or PtOEP-Alexa647 systems as oxygen-sensitive and reference dyes, respectively. 
Among these, the Ru(dpp)-RBITC-based microsensors emerged as the most reliable system, 
proving to be the optimal systems for biological studies. To evaluate its performance, we 
conducted tests within an in vitro three-dimensional cancer model employing sodium alginate 
as a hydrogel scaffold. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was selected as the tumor 
model due to its characteristic severe hypoxia, with oxygen levels as low as 0.7%.44, 45 Our 
investigations enabled the creation of spatial-temporal profiles for dissolved oxygen levels 
within the engineered tumor constructs, thereby confirming the applicability of our 
methodology for non-invasive recording of oxygen dynamics within tumor microenvironments 
and pharmacological evaluations.

2.2 Ru(dpp)-RBITC microsensor synthesis 
Ru(dpp)-RBITC microsensor synthesis is represented in Scheme 1a. Silica seed particles were 
synthesized by dissolving 2.8 mg of KCl in 1.12 mL of milliQ water. 12 mL of ethanol, 760 μL of 
NH4OH 28% and 200 μL of TEOS were added to the mixture and the reaction was kept under 
stirring at 240 rpm, for 20 minutes, at room temperature (RT). 
RBITC-APTES thiourea (with RBITC: APTES in 1:3 molar ratio) was performed by dissolving 0.2 
mg of RBITC in 2 mL of anhydrous ethanol. 0.37 μL of APTES were added to the solution, and 
the reaction mixture was kept under stirring for 2 hours at RT. Then, 2 mL of anhydrous ethanol 
and 0.50 μL of TEOS were added to thiourea crude-reaction solution. This solution was filled 
into a 6.0 mL syringe and injected into the flask containing the silica seed particles with a flow 
rate of 0.05 mL/minute. The reaction mixture was kept under stirring at 240 rpm, for 2 hours at 
RT. A second silica shell was prepared by dissolving 0.59 mg of Ru(dpp) into 3.3 mL of 
anhydrous ethanol maintaining a 1:1 molar ratio between Ru(dpp) and the RBITC of the inner 
shell. Then 336 μL of TEOS and 336 μL of PDMS-OH were added to the solution and the mixture 
was filled into a 6 mL syringe and injected into the flask containing the silica particles, with a 
flow rate of 0.05 mL/minute. The reaction was left under stirring at 240 rpm for 20 hours RT. The 
final product was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant was discarded. 
The pellet was washed in 40 mL of ethanol three times (1500 rpm, 5 minutes) and then in 
distilled water. The clean product was resuspended in ethanol in order to obtain a 40 mg/mL 
stock solution and stored in the dark at room temperature.

2.3 PtOEP-Alexa647 microsensor synthesis 
PtOEP-Alexa647 microsensor synthesis is represented in Scheme 1b. Silica seed particles 
were synthesized by dissolving 2.8 mg of KCl in 1.12 mL of milliQ water. 12mL of ethanol, 760 
μL of NH4OH 28% and 200 μL of TEOS were added to the reaction mixture, which was kept 
under stirring at 240 rpm, for 20 minutes, at RT. 
Alexa647-APTES thiourea synthesis (with Alexa647: APTES in 1:3 molar ratio) was performed by 
dissolving 0.5 mg of Alexa647 in 100 μL of DMSO. 2 mL anhydrous ethanol and 0.37 μL of APTES 
were added to such solution and the reaction was kept under stirring for 2 hours at RT. 
Subsequently, 2 mL of anhydrous ethanol and 0.50 μL of TEOS were added to the thiourea 
crude-reaction product and this solution was filled into a 6 mL syringe and injected into the 
flask containing the silica-seed particles, with a flow rate of 0.05 mL/minute. The reaction 
mixture was kept under stirring at 240 rpm, for 2 hours at RT. 
The second silica shell was prepared by dissolving 1.73 mg of PtOEP in 500 μL of chloroform 
and by adding this solution into 3.3 mL of anhydrous ethanol (considering a 1:6 molar ratio 
between Alexa647 and PtOEP, respectively. Then, 336 μL of TEOS and 336 μL of PDMS-OH were 
added to the solution. This mixture was filled into a 6 mL syringe and injected into the flask 
containing the silica particles with a flow rate of 0.05 mL/minute. The reaction was carried 
under stirring at 240 rpm for 20 hours at RT. 
The final product was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant was 
discarded. The pellet was washed in 40 mL ethanol three times (1500 rpm, 5 minutes) and then 
in distilled water other 3 times (1500 rpm, 5 minutes). The clean product was resuspended in 
ethanol in order to obtain a 40 mg/mL stock solution and stored in the dark at room 
temperature. 
 
2.4 Dynamic light scattering 
The size, dimension, monodispersity and surface charge of Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-
Alexa647 sensors were monitored during the synthesis and the washing steps via Dynamic 
Light Scattering (DLS) (Zetasizer Nano ZS, MALVERN) analysis (refractive index in water 1.458, 
absorption 0.010, 25°C, 2 min equilibrium time46). Data were collected and elaborated using 
the Zetasizer family software v7.12.

2.5 Flow cytometry analysis 
Ru(dpp)-RBITC or PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors were prepared at the concentration of 0.02 mg/mL 
in PBS 1X containing 5% FBS and 0.5% Triton X-100 in order to avoid their aggregation. After 30 
minutes of incubation in a sonicator bath (Digital ultrasonic cleaner, Argo Lab), microparticles 
were carefully pipetted up and down to reduce the aggregates and then analysed on a flow 
cytometer (CytoFLEX S, Beckman Coulter) with high resolution for nano- and microparticles 
measurement reached by using the side scatter of the 405 nm laser. The number of single 
events contained in 10 μL of solution was acquired and analysed using CytExpert software. 
Debris were excluded based upon forward scatter and side scatter measurements.  
 
2.6 Electron microscopy measurements 
The morphological characterization of Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors has been 
carried out adopting a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM 1400Plus, JEOL Ltd., 
Japan), equipped with LaB6 filament-source, operating at 120 kV.. 10 µL of a 4 mg/mL Ru(dpp)-
RBITC/PtOEP-Alexa647 ethanoic solution were drop-casted onto standard carbon-coated 
copper TEM grids, allowing the solvent to evaporate. The sample grids were further dried under 
vacuum overnight prior being transferred into the microscope for imaging. .  
The same samples, prepared on carbon-coated copper TEM grids, after being transferred onto 
dedicated SEM holders, were then analyzed adopting a scanning electron microscope (SEM, 
Carl Zeiss Merlin FE-SEM microscope, Germany) equipped with a Gemini II column, with a FEG 
source, operating at 20 kV, with a few seconds of acquisition time. SEM images of Ru(dpp)-
RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 were finally analysed via ImageJ 47 software in order to measure 
sensor diameters and distributions. 
2.7 Static contact angle measurements 
The hydrophobicity of Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 was assessed by measuring their 
static water contact angles (WCA) adopting a CAM 200 (KSV Instruments Ltd., Finland) 
instrument. A thin and homogeneous layer of sensors stock solution ( 100 µL) was deposited 
on the surface of a cover glass (24 X 24 mm, 0.13-0.17 mm thickness) (Figure S1). The samples 
were left drying overnight at room temperature. For the experiment set up, the liquid (heavy 
phase) was represented by water (d= 0,9986 g/cm3) and the liquid (light phase) was air

(d=0,0013 g/cm3). The measurements were performed by loading on the tip of the needle a drop 
of 2 µL of volume that was stroke on the surface of the sample.  
 
2.8 Calibration, reversibility, aging and dye leaching evaluation 
2 μL of Ru(dpp)-RBITC or PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors stock solution were diluted in 250 μL of 
Leibovitz’s L-15 medium no phenol red (L-15, Gibco) for calibration and for reversibility, after 
having dispersed the stock solutions by vortexing. 
Sensors were calibrated starting from 0.5% up to atmospheric PO2 of 19.6% adopting a 
CLARIOstar® Plus plate reader (CLARIOstar, BMG LABTECH Inc., USA) equipped with an 
Atmospheric Control Unit (ACU) while data were acquired and analyzed using MARS Data 
Analysis software provided by the manufacturer. The ACU was purging N2 into a multiwell 
chamber containing Ru(dpp)-RBITC or PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors dissolved in L-15 medium 
while O2 concentration was continuously monitored. Five acquisitions for each known PO2 
(0.5%, 5.0%, 10.0%, 15.0%, 19.6%) were recorded and the calibration curve was extracted. 
The aging of the sensors was evaluated by storing them at 4 °C in L-15 medium and the same 
calibration was repeated after 10 days. 
The reversibility was evaluated by recording three cycles of switches between atmospheric PO2 
of 19.6 % and 0.5 % and the measurements were repeated after 10 days to evaluate their aging. 
Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors were excited at λex = 468 nm and λex = 561 nm, fluorescence emission 
signals were collected in the 500-700 nm range and 570-700 nm range, respectively. PtOEP-
Alexa647 sensors were excited at λex = 542 nm and λex = 650 nm, fluorescence emission signals 
were acquired in the 570-700 nm range and 670-700 nm range, respectively.  
Possible dye leaking was evaluated after 1, 3 and 10 days of aging by diluting 120 μL of samples 
in 1500 μL of L-15 medium. At the selected times, sensors were centrifuged (6000 rpm, 45 
seconds) and surnatant was sieved using a 1 μm pluriStrainer® filters and the absorbance was 
recorded in the range 400-800 nm (1 nm resolution). 
 
2.9 Evaluation of sensors selectivity 
Ru(dpp)-RBITC or PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors at fixed PO2 of 19.6 % were tested at various pH 
values, in the 5.0-8.0 range, at different concentrations of Na+ or K+, in the range 0-160 mM and 
at different concentrations of H2O2, in the range 0-30 mM. 100 μL of stock solution were added 
to 20 mL of L-15 media, then the pH was adjusted with NaOH 1M or HCl 1M and monitored by

a pHmeter (XS50, XS Instruments, Italy) at selected pH values (5.0, 5.5., 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0). 
Similarly, 6 μL of sensors stock solution were added to 1 mL of distilled water at selected Na+ 
or K+ dilutions in the physiological range (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160 mM) while 6 μL of 
sensors stock solution were added to 1 mL of L-15 media adjusted at physiologically relevant 
H2O2 concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 30 mM). Finally, aliquots of each sample were analysed at 
the plate reader by adopting the same setting mentioned in section 2.8.  
 
2.10 Biocompatibility of sensors 
The biocompatibility of Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors was evaluated by in vitro 
cytotoxicity assays using human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), human pancreatic cancer 
cells (AsPC-1), breast cancer cells (MCF7) and 3T3 fibroblast cell line. Cells were obtained from 
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md., USA) and cultured at 37 °C in a 
humidified 5% CO2. AsPC-1 were routinely cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Merck KGaA, 
Darmstadt, Germany) whereas HeLa, MCF7 and 3T3 were grown in DMEM medium (Sigma-
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), both supplemented with 10% Fetal bovine Serum (FBS, 
Gibco), 2mM L-glutammine and 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma-Merck KGaA, 
Darmstadt, Germany). The cell lines (50x104 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates and their 
viability was evaluated through MTT assay (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Cells were 
treated with Ru(dpp)-RBITC or PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors at the final concentration of 0.4 μg/mL 
starting from Ru(dpp)-RBITC stock solutions of 35.6 mg/mL and PtOEP-Alexa647 stock 
solutions of 40 mg/mL. Untreated cells were used as control. After 24 and 48 hours of 
treatment, 50 μL of MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL final concentration) were added into each well and 
incubated for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. In order to dissolve the formazan crystals, acidified 
isopropanol (2M HCl in isopropanol) was added to each well (1:1 ratio) and properly mixed. The 
absorbance was measured at 590 nm using a microplate reader (ClarioStarPlus, BMG 
Labtech). The medium without cells and containing Ru(dpp)-RBITC or PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors 
was used as blank subtracted from the absorbance values of the samples. 
 
2.11 Production of three-dimensional (3D) oxygen sensing alginate scaffolds 
The 3D oxygen sensing scaffolds were produced by adapting the methodology previously 
described by Rizzo et al.48 (Figure S2). Briefly, human pancreatic tumour cells, AsPC-1 (ATCC 
CRL-1682) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator according to ATCC

protocols. Human immortalized pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), kindly provided by Dr. Enza 
Lonardo (Institute of Genetics and Biophysics of Cnr, Naples, Italy) were cultured in DMEM 
medium (Sigma-Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 2 
mM glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) at 
37 °C with 5% CO2. Tumor cells, prelabelled with CellTracker™ Deep Red (Invitrogen, 
ThermoFisher Scientific) and PSC cells were mixed in a 1:3 ratio in 250 μL of culture medium.49 
Then, 250 μL of 3% (w/v) alginate (dissolved in deionized and sterile water) were added to the 
cell suspension with 40 μL of oxygen sensors and gentle mixed for 5 minutes. Subsequently, 
the alginate solution, containing cells and sensors was collected into a syringe (BD Plastipak™ 
1-mL Syringe) and placed into a syringe pump. By applying a high-voltage generator, alginate 
microgels were formed once the suspension droplets felt into the calcium chloride solution 
(100 mM CaCl2 and 0.4% w/v of Tween-20 dissolved in water). Next, the alginate microgels 
embedding cells and oxygen sensors, were washed with fresh culture medium to remove the 
unreacted calcium chloride solution, and kept in the incubator under controlled temperature 
and 5% CO2 before been processed for CLSM live imaging. In parallel, alginate microgels 
embedding oxygen sensors without cells were used for the calibration of the system through 
their exposure to known oxygen concentrations as described in section 2.12. 
 
2.12 Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) characterization 
Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 morphological characterization was performed via super-
resolution (LSM980 microscope equipped with Airyscan confocal super-resolution, Zeiss). 
Images were acquired with a 63x oil immersion objective, adopting Airyscan in resolution mode 
and employing 2.5 (resolution 1267x1267; field of view 53.87 x 53.57 µm) or a 5.0 as zoom 
(resolution 1024x1024; field of view 26.94 x 26.94 µm). During the imaging, Ru(dpp) was excited 
with ex=488nm (em=400-750 nm), RBITC and PtOEP were excited with ex=543nm (em=400-
750nm) and Alexa 647 was excited with ex=639 nm (em=400-750 nm).  
For CLSM analyses, alginate microgels or 2 µL of the stock solution of free sensors added to 
300 µL of L-15 were deposited into a µ-Slide 8 Well Chamber Slide (IBIDI) previously treated 
with 0.3 mg/mL of Poly-L-lysine (37 °C, 30 min). Calibrations and live imaging were performed 
via CLSM (LSM 700 microscope, Zeiss) equipped with Okolab Stage Top Incubator and LEO 
hand-held meter (Okolab s.r.l., Italy), which was equilibrated to 37°C, 95% relative humidity and 
PO2 in the 1-18 % range. The calibrations of the sensors were acquired with a 63x oil immersion

(em=400-700 nm), RBITC and PtOEP were excited with ex=555nm (em=570-700nm), AsPC-1 
stained with Deep Red and Alexa 647 were excited with ex=639 nm (em=640-700 nm) keeping 
the pinhole at 1 AU.  
Gain and offset of the different laser lines were optimized at PO2 1%. Prior timelapse imaging, 
the oxygen content of the fresh L-15 media at time 0 (as control) was also measured adopting 
an optical probe (Vernier Go Direct® Optical dissolved oxygen probe). 
 
2.13 Image segmentation and analysis 
Confocal images of Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors were analysed with GNU 
Octave (version 7.2.0) with a custom algorithm48, 50 to automatically extract the microparticle 
fluorescence intensity for ratiometric analyses. Briefly, 3D (x,y,z) images of the reference (RBITC 
or Alexa647) channels were first converted to grayscale and binarized with Otsu’s method.51 
Then, objects (i.e., the oxygen sensors) in 3D were identified by direct connectivity of the binary 
images along the z-axis, obtaining a 3D binary matrix, which was used as a mask to extract 
positions and mean fluorescence intensity ratios of the particles belonging to the original 
indicator and reference dyes images. Specifically, for each sensor particle, the pixel-by-pixel 
ratio between indicator and reference fluorescence intensities was calculated and averaged 
over the number pixels composing that sensor. Oxygen values were extracted by using a 
previously obtained calibration curve. 
 
2.14 Statistical analysis 
All experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean ± 
standard error. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare multiple 
conditions, and the Student’s t-test was used for individual group comparison. Differences 
were considered significant with p-values < 0.05.

3.0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1 Synthesis of the oxygen sensing microparticles 
Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 oxygen sensing microparticles were both obtained by a 
one-pot strategy based on a modified Stöber process.52 This bottom-up approach, that exploits 
the hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate for the sol-gel transition, is the most used for the 
production of silica nano- and microparticles with a diameter ranging from 50 to 2000 nm.53 As 
shown in Scheme 1a, we produced silica core particles that were functionalized as ormosil 
(organically modified silica), with the thiourea obtained from the reaction between (3-
aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and RBITC. These RBITC-labelled microparticles were then used 
for the non-covalent immobilization of oxygen sensing metal-organic complexes. Ru(dpp) was 
embedded in the microparticles by using both TEOS and PDMS-OH for the outer shell growth. 
The same approach was used for the synthesis of PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors (Scheme 1b) by 
employing Alexa 647 as reference dye. The obtained microsensors were then purified by 
centrifugations and resuspensions in ethanol, without any further purification steps. Both 
synthesis procedures are straightforward processes, carried out under mild conditions, 
requiring very few purification steps, making the whole procedure affordable and easy to be 
scaled up.

Ru(dpp)-RBITC oxygen sensors resulted to have an average hydrodynamic diameter of 1530 nm 
± 55 nm (PdI 0.0013) (Figure 1a) and a zeta potential of -43.8 ± 2.1 mV, while PtOEP-Alexa647 
oxygen sensors resulted to have and average hydrodynamic diameter of 1741 nm ± 186 nm (PdI 
0.011) (Figure 1b) and a zeta potential of -48.1 ± 2.7 mV. Such difference in microparticle sizes 
might be related to the slightly different synthesis protocols, since the Stöber process is highly 
influenced by chemical and physical parameters such as solvents, type of base, potassium 
chloride concentration, temperature and reaction mixture viscosity53. Hydrodynamic size 
measurements of silica tagged with only RBITC or Alexa647 reference dyes were recorded and 
were compared with those of the fully assembled sensors to further assess the presence of the 
PDMS-OH polymer shell embedding Ru(dpp) dye or PtOEP dye. Notably, SiO2-RBITC resulted 
to have an average hydrodynamic diameter of 1248 ± 73 nm (PdI 0.003) (Figure 1a), while SiO2-
Alexa647 presented a diameter of 1391 ± 80 nm (PdI 0.003) (Figure 1 b) showing a size 
approximately  300 nm smaller than the size of the oxygen sensing microparticles (1530 nm ± 
55 nm and 1741 nm ± 186 nm, respectively) suggesting the presence of the PDMS-OH shell in 
both systems. SEM analyses, together with the average particle diameters, revealed 
morphological differences between plain and functionalized microparticles. For instance, 
silica microparticles (Figures 1c-d) exhibited a regular spherical shape and slight corrugations 
on the surface, due to silica porosity52 and uniform diameter distribution with an average 
diameter of 1044 ± 23 nm (PdI 0.0005). Conversely, because of their outer shell, constituted by 
Ru(dpp) immobilized in PDMS-OH, Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors (Figures 1i-j) displayed a rough 
surface and a higher average diameter of 1356 ± 62 nm (PdI 0.002).54 The outer shell of PtOEP-
Alexa647 sensors (Figures 1o-p) appeared less corrugated, more homogeneous and with a 
bigger average diameter of 1607 ± 64 nm (PdI 0.002), compared to the one of Ru(dpp)-RBITC 
sensors, despite a similar synthetic protocol. This could be ascribed to the different PtOEP 
polarity as well as to its different interaction with PDMS-OH.35 In general, diameters extracted 
from SEM images were in accordance with the values reported by DLS analyses. Nevertheless, 
hydrodynamic sizes resulted being bigger than the ones evaluated in dry conditions, likely due 
to the dynamic swelling in water of the PDMS-OH layer.54 To further evaluate the thickness of 
PDMS-OH polymer deposited on top of the silica cores, TEM analyses were performed. Silica 
microparticles (Figures 1e-f-g) exhibited a spherical shape with a smooth surface while 
Ru(dpp)-RBITC (Figures 1k-l-m) and PtOEP-Alexa647 (Figures 1q-r-s) showed a more

corrugated surface characterized by the presence of a shell of approximately 40 nm and 10 nm, 
respectively confirming the presence of PDMS-OH polymer layer. Contact angle 
measurements showed that the silica microparticles (θ=53,43 ± 6,47) (Figures 1h) are 
hydrophilic with a static contact angle θ<90°, while Ru(dpp)-RBITC (θ=149,68±10,19) (Figures 
1n) and PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors (θ=146,27 ± 4,04) (Figures 1t) are hydrophobic being θ >90°. 
These differences could be due to the presence of the hydrophobic PDMS-OH outer shell on 
the assembled Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors. Airyscan confocal super-
resolution measurements were performed to localize the reference and sensing dyes and to 
evaluate their distribution in the assembled sensors. Ru(dpp)-RBITC imaging revealed the 
presence of two concentric rings: the inner ring corresponded to the RBITC while the outer ring 
to Ru(dpp) (Figures 1u, S3). Profile analyses performed on several Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors 
(Figures 1w-x) revealed an average distance of 37 ± 9 nm between the RBITC and the Ru(dpp) 
maximum intensities. These distances are in accordance with Ru(dpp)-RBITC shell 
measurements via TEM analyses. The imaging of PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors also revealed the 
presence of two concentric rings with the inner one corresponding to Alexa647 and the outer 
one to PtOEP (Figures 1v, S4). Profile analyses performed on several PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors 
(Figures 1w-x) revealed an average distance of 15 ± 3 nm between the PtOEP and Alexa647, in 
accordance with TEM measurements. The number of microsensors ascertained via flow 
cytometry analyses resulted 1704.4 ± 59.6 μ-particles/μL (85220 μ-particles/mg) for Ru(dpp)-
RBITC while 184.3 ± 33.4 μ-particles/μL (9210 μ-particles/mg) for PtOEP-Alexa647, accordingly 
with the different sensors dimension evaluated via SEM and DLS analyses.

3.3 Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 microsensors respond to rapid changes in oxygen and 
are stable over time 
To assess whether Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 oxygen microsensors are accurate, 
sensitive and stable over time, we performed calibration measurements and reversibility 
studies. Indeed, one of the main concern for these systems can be the reversibility and the 
rapidity of their response to oxygen concentrations; notably, these properties are intrinsic to 
the employed metal-organic dyes, and for this reason they are difficult to be tailored.55 For 
calibration tests, oxygen microsensors were dispersed in L-15 media and PO2 was adjusted at 
selected values (0.5 - 19.6 % PO2 range). The calibration curves of Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors and 
PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors obtained through spectrofluorometry analysis are reported in Figures 
2a-b and are compared to those of the free dyes in solution (Figure S5) to evaluate if coupling 
and immobilization of the dyes to the final sensors could affect sensing behaviour. Ideally, the 
interaction between molecular oxygen and the employed metal-organic complexes should

quench Ru(dpp) and PtOEP fluorescence signals in a proportional way, following the Stern-
Volmer equation 56 (further details described in SI) . Indeed, the obtained results (Figure 2a-b) 
proved that the coupled and immobilized dyes in the assembled sensors maintain a similar 
behaviour to that of the free dyes in solution (Figure S5) and indicate that the chosen strategy 
of entrapment preserves the sensibility of the oxygen probes. Both microsensors are sensitive 
to dissolved O2 concentration; notably, the fluorescence intensity ratio (IRu(dpp)/IRBITC or 
IPtOEP/IAlexa647) decreases as a function of oxygen concentration. The slope of the calibration curve 
is also a parameter useful to assess the sensors sensitivity towards oxygen. In our case 
Ru(dpp)-based sensors were more sensitive compared to the PtOEP ones (Figures 2a-b), due 
to the higher slope in the calibration curve (0.020 for Ru(dpp) and 0.013 for PtOEP). Sensor’s 
reversibility and aging were also investigated (Figure 2). Reversibility was evaluated by a series 
of switches between PO2 of 19.6 % and 0.5 % (Figure 2c-d). Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors appeared 
more sensitive compared to PtOEP-Alexa647 which showed lower ratios values. As regards the 
sensors aging, calibrations (Figure 2a-b) and the same series of PO2 switches (Figure 2c-d) 
were repeated after 10 days on the same samples for studying their sensing ability despite the 
aging. Although the aging led to a slight decrease in fluorescence signals, all observed 
differences resulted not statistically significant accordingly to ANOVA with single factor 
(α=0.05) thus proving that both the systems preserved their sensitivity. Finally, dyes leaking 
from the assembled sensors was evaluated over time. Absorbance measurements (Figure 
S6a-b) demonstrated high sensors robustness with negligible absorbance in the range 400-800 
nm after 10 days of aging in L-15 media at 4°C.

3.4 Oxygen measurements are not affected by pH, Na+, K+ and H2O2 variations 
Selectivity of oxygen sensors to the sole PO2 is crucial for measuring correct values of oxygen 
levels, independently from other biological analytes in the surrounding microenvironment. In 
biological systems, pH is a parameter that can vary between tissues and cell compartments.57 
In addition, cations like Na+ and K+ play an important role in the regulation of cellular electrolyte 
metabolism, electric signalling in cells, transport of essential nutrients and determination of 
the membrane potential.58 To evaluate selectivity at different pH values and cation 
concentrations, sensors, kept at PO2 of 19.6 %, were incubated in pH-adjusted L-15 media in 
the physiological range (from 5.0 to 8.0) or in buffers at know Na+/K+ concentration in the 
physiological range (from 0 to 160 mM) and their emission signals were recorded at the plate 
reader. As shown in Figures 2e-f, pHs and oxygen were not correlated for both sensing 
microparticles. Indeed, the ratio between each sensitive and reference dyes, remained 
constantly independent of the pH variations. However, it should be noticed that the ratio values 
for Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors showed less fluctuation around the mean value compared to the 
PtOEP-Alexa647 ones. This could be ascribed not only to the metal-organic complex itself, but 
also to the reference indicators (RBITC and Alexa647). Indeed, Alexa647 stability decreases in 
buffer as stated by the producers.59 This assumption was further confirmed by the results 
recorded in presence of increasing concentration of Na+/K+ (Figures 2g-h). Ru(dpp)-RBITC

sensors showed random fluctuation around the mean value at increasing concentration of 
Na+/K+ proving their selectivity towards oxygen even in presence of high cations concentrations. 
PtOEP-Alexa647 oxygen dosages appeared slightly altered at K+ concentrations higher than 100 
mM, confirming that Alexa647 stability is influenced by the ionic strength of the buffer 
employed during the measurements. However, this small interference does not affect 
extracellular oxygen monitoring where the highest K+ concentration reaches approximately 30 
mM in pathological conditions.60, 61 Taken together, the results suggest that Ru(dpp)-RBITC 
sensors can be employed either for intra- or extracellular measurements whereas PtOEP-
Alexa647 sensors can be better suited for extracellular monitoring of oxygen in those biological 
systems, such as the tumour microenvironment, that are notoriously affected by pH 
fluctuations and Na+/K+ variations.4 Dissolved oxygen results 10-1000 times in excess 
compared to reactive oxygen species62 (ROS) nevertheless, the amount of ROS compared to 
dissolved oxygen was investigated to evaluate sensors affinity also towards reactive oxygen 
species. For instance, Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors response was tested in 
presence of L15 medium enriched with known relevant concentrations of H2O2 in the physio-
pathological range (0, 5, 10, 20 30 mM) at PO2 19.6%. The results reported in Figure 2 i-j show 
random fluctuations of Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 ratios around their mean values, 
attesting a nonspecific response of the sensors toward ROS species proving that oxygen 
measurements are not affected by ROS variations. This could probably attributed to the PDMS-
OH shell with excellent chemical stability (high resistance to acid, base or oil) and tunable 
adhesion to silica surfaces63 that embeds and protects effectively the oxygen-sensitive 
Ru(dpp)/PtOEP dyes.  
 
3.5 Oxygen sensing microparticles do not affect cell viability 
Biosensors play a crucial role in quickly and precisely detecting biological analytes within both 
physiological and pathological systems, including cancer. Their utility extends to assessing the 
efficacy of anticancer chemotherapy agents, offering valuable insights into treatment 
outcomes.9 To explore the suitability of the oxygen sensing microparticles for practical 
applications, we evaluated their cytotoxicity across three distinct tumor cell lines and on 
normal cells as cancer cell viability is typically higher than that of normal cells. HeLa, AsPC-1, 
and MCF7 tumor cells or 3T3 normal cells were incubated with either Ru(dpp)-RBITC or PtOEP-

Alexa647 sensors for 0, 24, and 48 hours, followed by assessment of cell viability using the MTT 
assay. Untreated cells served as the control group. As reported in Figure 3, no significant 
cytotoxic effect was observed in all treated cells in comparison to their respective controls. 
Specifically, cells incubated with the oxygen microsensors exhibited consistent viability levels 
across various incubation time points, with no statistically significant differences in terms of 
cytotoxicity observed between the treated and untreated groups.

The nontoxic behaviour of the microsensors could be mainly due to the bio-inert silica 
behaviour64 and to the biocompatible oxygen permeable PDMS-OH sealer.65 Furthermore, the 
micrometer size of the particles allows the reduction of surface energy which is the main cause 
of interaction of nanoparticles with cell organelles66 and biomolecules.67, 68

3.6 Response of Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors to oxygen variations  
Figure 4a shows representative CLSM micrographs of Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors at PO2 of 1.3 %, 
6.0 %, 11.7 % and 17.2 %, respectively. In Figure 4b, the intensity ratio IRu(dpp)/IRBITC, obtained 
from CLSM images analyzed through image segmentation algorithms, is reported against the 
PO2. In accordance with the physical properties of the oxygen-sensitive probe Ru(dpp),37 the 
emission of the microsensors was highly dependent on the local dissolved oxygen. In 
particular, at low concentration of oxygen the Ru(dpp) fluorescence intensity (in green, false 
color) is high, while at high concentration of dissolved oxygen the Ru(dpp) fluorescence is 
quenched. Instead, as expected, the intensity of the reference dye, RBITC (red), does not 
change as dramatically as Ru(dpp) at high and low concentration of dissolved oxygen (Figure 
4a). As represented in the calibration curve (fit parameters illustrated in the graph) of Figure 4b, 
the relationship between the fluorescence intensity ratio and dissolved oxygen is inversely 
proportional in strongly agreement with the Stern-Voltmer equation.56 
Similarly, Figure 4c-d show the results obtained for the PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors. In Figure 4c 
representative confocal micrographs at PO2 of 1.4 %, 6.1 %, 11.6 % and 17.1 % are reported and 
in Figure 4d the intensity ratios (IPtOEP/IAlexa647) recorded by the CLSM analysis are shown. 
Similarly to the Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors, the PtOEP-Alexa647 oxygen sensors showed a 
behaviour in accordance with the photophysical properties of the oxygen sensing PtOEP dye.35 
Also here, the curve trend attests an inversely proportional relationship between PtOEP 
fluorescence and oxygen concentration in accordance with the Stern-Voltmer equation.56 
Importantly, these CLSM analyses are in accordance with spectrofluorimetric data and 
confirmed Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors to be more sensitive and accurate in measuring the oxygen 
content than PtOEP-Alexa647. Indeed, Ru(dpp)-RBITC equation of the fit calibration curve has 
a higher slope (0.030 for Ru(dpp) and 0.020 for PtOEP) than that of PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors.

Since organic fluorescent indicators are affected by photobleaching during long exposures at 
CLSM,69 we carried out photobleaching tests to evaluate the possibility of change in emission 
ratio. Cycles of 20 acquisitions, in the same field of view, at low and high PO2, were recorded 
applying the same settings employed during the CLSM calibration of the sensors. Figure S7 
reports green and red channels, as well as the ratio trends of Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensing 
microparticles at PO2 of 1.3% (a-b) and 17.2% (c-d), respectively. Ru(dpp)-RBITC is still 
responsive after 20 acquisitions, and the sensors appear reliable and robust with negligible 
emission intensity fluctuations and absence of ratio trend at both the monitored PO2. The 
results proved that both reference and sensitive dyes have similar quenching behaviour thus, 
the ratio was always conserved. Regarding the PtOEP-Alexa647 sensors, dye emission 
intensities exhibited small fluctuations at both 1.4% (Figure S8a-b) and 17.1% (Figure S8c-d) 
of PO2. However, being these small and random fluctuations, they did not alter the intensity 
ratio at high PO2. On the contrary, despite the use of very low laser powers, Alexa647 reference 
dye was more affected by photobleaching at low PO2 and this caused a slight alteration of the 
ratio. This finding is in accordance with spectrofluorimetric results and confirms that Alexa647 
photostability decreases in buffer as stated by the producers.59 Overall, Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors 
were more promising in terms of oxygen sensitivity and photobleaching. Therefore, Ru(dpp)-
RBITC sensors were employed for next biological studies.  
 
3.7 Oxygen-sensing properties of Ru(dpp)-RBITC microparticles in in vitro 3D alginate 
scaffolds 
Next, the response of Ru(dpp)-RBITC oxygen sensors was tested within 3D alginate hydrogel 
scaffolds. To this aim, the sensors were embedded in alginate hydrogels and exposed to 
different oxygen concentrations (PO2 range 1.5-17.1%) for 40 minutes before being imaged by 
CLSM. As shown Figure S9a, according to the optical properties of the oxygen-sensitive probe 
(Ru(dpp)) and the reference dye (RBITC), the microsensors at PO2 1.5% emit a strong

fluorescence signal from Ru(dpp) probe that becomes quenched when the local oxygen 
concentration approaches atmospheric values (PO2 17.1%), while the red emission from RBITC 
remains unchanged. The sensors display a linear response in the range of oxygen percentage 
between 1.5 % and 17.1 %, with a correlation coefficient R2=0,962 (Figure S9b).  
Notably, the confocal setting (laser power and gain) was optimized in order to overcome 
attenuation of the signal due to the presence of the alginate hydrogel. Thus, the fluorescence 
signal stability of Ru(dpp)-RBITC microparticles was tested. Cycles of 20 acquisitions were 
recorded on z-stacks of the same alginate hydrogel embedding Ru(dpp)-RBITC sensors in L-15 
medium, at low and high oxygen percentage, adopting the settings employed during CLSM 
calibration. Graphs reported in Figure S10 shows the fluorescence intensity of individual 
Ru(dpp) and RBITC channels and their ratio at PO2 of 1.2% (Figure S10 a-b) and 17.1% (Figure 
S10 c-d), respectively. The obtained results demonstrate that the alginate matrix and the 
selected laser power do not affect sensor’s performance, indeed the fluorescence signal 
remains stable over time with a similar trend to that of the free sensors in L-15 medium (Figure 
S7). Remarkably, the sensitivity of the core-shell Ru(dpp)-RBITC microsensors was preserved 
after the encapsulation steps into thr hydrogel matrixes. Afterwards, pancreatic cancer cells, 
AsPC-1 cell line, and pancreatic stromal cells, PSCs, were selected to develop hybrid cell-
seeded oxygen sensing hydrogels that mimic the three dimentional tumor microenvironment 
of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The validation of the O2-sensing hybrid 
hydrogels in an in vitro tumor model is crucial given the presence of oxygen gradients with 
multiple hypoxic regions within the tumor microenvironment.70 In this context we selected 
PDAC because it is among the tumors considered severely hypoxic, with a low oxygen content 
around 0.7 %.44 To noninvasively monitor oxygen variations over time and space, O2-sensing 
hybrid hydrogels were produced (see Material and Methods and Scheme in Figure S2). In 
particular, PSCs and AsPC-1 cells were encapsulated in alginate hydrogels containing Ru(dpp)-
RBITC oxygen sensors, and oxygen variations were monitored for 12 hours by time lapse CSLM 
imaging. In Figure 5a and Figure S11a, representative CLSM images of the whole system are 
reported. The intensity ratio of each oxygen sensor was calculated over time and the oxygen 
values, extracted from the calibration curve (Figure S9b), were converted in color. For the whole 
oxygen sensing alginate hydrogel, a 3D map was created for each time point (from 0 to 12 hours) 
for monitoring the dynamic variations of the oxygen sensors over time and space (Figure 5b 
and Figure S11b). In particular at the same time point (time 0 and time 12h) the sensors

surrounding tumor and stromal cells in the alginate hydrogel show different colors at different 
positions along the axes. Moreover, a strong reduction in oxygen concentration is evident after 
12 hours of monitoring as reported by the color change of the sensors from red to yellow in the 
colorimetric map. Notably, it is known that cancer cells response to reduced oxygenation is not 
always the same, since cell death or viability can occur depending on the time of exposure to 
hypoxia.71 In fact, as reported in the Figure S12, fluctuations of oxygen levels were recorded 
during the time-lapse experiment reaching low level (PO2 2.7 ± 0.1 %) after 12 hours of 
monitoring. These data reveal both the presence of a heterogeneous gradient of oxygen in the 
extracellular environment and the good performance and reliability of the oxygen sensors in a 
3D environment.

4.0 CONCLUSIONS 
Fluorescence-based sensing tools have emerged as a promising technology for detecting key 
metabolic parameters, such as oxygen, in biological systems, both in vitro and in vivo. However, 
their application in the field of 3D tumor models demand more precise methods to monitor 
analyte concentrations with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we employed 
Tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) 
dichloride 
(Ru(dpp)) 
and 
Platinum 
octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) as oxygen sensing indicators for synthesizing two classes of silica 
core-double shell microparticle-based ratiometric sensors. We detailed the synthetic 
processes and properties of the resulting optical sensors, including morphology, performance, 
and toxicity assessment. Notably, the fabrication of these microsensors yielded simple, cost-
effective, and innovative silica core-shell systems. Their response to oxygen variations was 
rapid, highly reproducible, and stable over time. Furthermore, cytotoxicity assays 
demonstrated the biocompatibility of the microsensors, making them suitable for in vitro cell 
studies. The enhanced oxygen-sensing microparticles, based on Ru(dpp)-RBITC dyes, were 
effectively utilized within a 3D in vitro construct mimicking the pancreatic tumor 
microenvironment. 
These 
sensors 
accurately 
tracked 
dynamic 
oxygen 
variations 
accompanying cellular proliferation, showcasing their potential for advanced biological 
studies. The present study highlights the potential of ratiometric core-double shell oxygen 
sensors in capturing spatio-temporal oxygen gradients within complex three-dimensional 
cellular architectures. 
Temperature is a parameter that could affect the sensitivity of the oxygen sensing dyes27, 55 
however, these studies are intended to be done at 37°C thus, this issue will never be faced. 
Photobleaching over time is another potential limitation which can be observed if the sensors 
are used for prolonged periods. This is a general limitation that can be avoided using low 
intensity excitation lights and low exposure times. Moreover, Ru(dpp)-RBITC and PtOEP-
Alexa647 are also compatible for PLIM analysis and are active to multiphoton imaging24 that 
allow to reduce photobleaching issues and extensive sensors usage. Our findings indicate that 
these hybrid core-shell micro-silica sensors can be seamlessly integrated into 3D scaffolds 
resembling the extracellular matrix, offering a versatile and promising tool for conducting 
precise investigations into the role of hypoxia in cancer development and progression. This

versatility places these sensors as valuable assets for delineating oxygen distribution both in 
vitro and in vivo. Moreover, their robustness, adaptability, and customizable nature enable their 
application to extend beyond cancer research. These sensors can find utility in environmental 
monitoring of oxygen levels in water samples or in tracking reactive oxygen species,33 
employing different combinations of dyes tailored to specific analysis setups.
