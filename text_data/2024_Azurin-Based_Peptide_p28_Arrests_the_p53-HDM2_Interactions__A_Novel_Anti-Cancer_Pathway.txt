Abstract
Azurin and its derived peptides, particularly p28, have shown strong anticancer effects,
primarily due to their capacity to stabilize the p53 tumor suppressor protein and prevent its
degradation. Previous studies have demonstrated that p28 interacts with the DNA-binding
domain of p53, protecting it from degradation mechanisms. Building on these insights, our
research explored whether the p28 peptide influences other cancer-related pathways beyond
just p53 stabilization. Specifically, we focused on the interactions between the p28 peptide
and Human Double Minute 2 (HDM2), a protein known to negatively regulate p53’s tumor-
suppressive activity.
HDM2 plays a critical role in downregulating p53 by binding to its transactivation domain
(TAD), leading to a reduction in p53’s ability to perform its tumor-suppressive functions. Our
study aimed to determine if p28 disrupts the interaction between HDM2 and p53, and if so, to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind this effect. Using HADDOCK docking combined
with molecular dynamics simulations, we identified three stable conformations of the HDM2-
p28 complex. These conformations effectively occupy HDM2’s hydrophobic pocket, allowing
for sustained inter-chain interactions and exhibiting favorable binding energies. Through fur-
ther analysis, we pinpointed the essential residues involved in these interactions and calculated
their interaction energies using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area
(MMPBSA) method.

Our findings reveal that by blocking HDM2’s binding sites, the p28 peptide can help main-
tain p53’s transcriptional activity, thereby enhancing its tumor-suppressive roles, including the
induction of apoptosis and the arrest of the cell cycle in cancer cells. This study significantly
advances our understanding of azurin-derived peptides’ anticancer mechanisms, demonstrat-
ing the therapeutic potential of p28 as a promising peptide-based agent for cancer treatment.
Furthermore, these findings may open doors to designing additional peptide-based therapies
targeting HDM2 and other pathways critical for cancer progression, offering a new avenue in
the development of effective anticancer therapeutics.

Introduction
Human double minute 2 (HDM2), the human homologue of the originally identified mouse double
minute 2 (MDM2), is a 491-amino acid phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in regulating the
p53 tumor suppressor protein.1 The p53 tumor suppressor is a pivotal regulator of cellular stress re-
sponses, playing a crucial role in enforcing cell growth arrest, inducing senescence, and initiating
apoptosis in response to various forms of cellular stress.2,3 Its ability to suppress the propaga-
tion of cells harboring damaged or potentially mutagenic DNA is vital for maintaining genomic
integrity. The p53 protein mediates these protective effects primarily through a transcription-
dependent mechanism.4,5 A central feature of p53 biology is its tight regulation at the protein
level, as cellular p53 concentrations are a key determinant of its function. In unstressed cells, p53
is maintained at low levels due to its rapid degradation, with a half-life of 5 to 30 minutes, primar-
ily controlled by the ubiquitin ligase MDM2.2,3 Upon exposure to stress, p53 levels are swiftly
elevated, allowing it to exert its tumor suppressor functions effectively.
Structural studies of the p53-MDM2 complex reveal that MDM2’s amino-terminal domain
binds to p53’s transactivation domain (TAD) within a hydrophobic pocket.6 This interaction in-
volves residues 25–109 of MDM2 forming the HDM2 NTD and a 15-amino acid amphipathic
peptide in p53, with key binding sites located at residues 18–26 of p53.7–9 Residues PHE19,
TRP23, and LEU26 of p53, which bind to the hydrophobic pocket of HDM2, play crucial role
for this protein-protein interaction. These interactions are essential for the regulation of p53’s tu-
mor suppressor activity, as HDM2 binding leads to its functional inhibition.7,10 The interaction
is characterized by a precise key-lock fit, with p53’s amphipathic α-helix fitting into a hydropho-
bic cleft in MDM2. THR18 in p53 stabilizes this α-helix, while MDM2’s binding cleft, formed
by residues 54-74 and 94-104, features a groove lined with hydrophobic and aromatic residues.
Conversely, mutations at GLY58, GLU68, VAL75, or CYS77 in MDM2 can disrupt its binding
to p53.11 Figure 1 illustrates the native HDM2-p53 interaction sites, highlighting the hydrophobic
cleft and the crucial binding residues of p53. The binding affinity of p53-MDM2 complex ranges
2
from 60 to 700 nM, depending on the number of residues of the p53 protein involved.12–14 Such
binding inhibits p53’s ability to activate transcription by physically blocking its interaction with
the transcriptional machinery.

PHE19, TRP23, and LEU26 of p53, represented in stick model and colored orange, binding to the
hydrophobic pocket of HDM2.
Phosphorylation also plays a key role in regulating this interaction. While phosphorylation of
SER15 and SER20 does not affect p53-MDM2 binding, phosphorylation of THR18 weakens the
interaction by 10-fold, indicating that THR18 phosphorylation is critical for disrupting p53-MDM2
binding.13,14 DNA damage-induced disruption of this complex in vivo specifically requires THR18
phosphorylation, though the stabilization of p53 after ionizing radiation involves a phosphorylation
cascade beginning with SER15, which facilitates subsequent phosphorylation of THR18. Nuclear
magnetic resonance studies reveal that p53 binding induces significant conformational changes in
MDM2 that extend beyond the binding cleft. Overall, conformation and hydrophobicity are key
determinants of the p53-MDM2 interaction.
As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2 is primarily responsible for tagging p53 for degradation,
thus controlling its cellular levels.15,16 MDM2 features a self- and p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase
activity located within its evolutionarily conserved COOH-terminal RING finger domain, which is
essential for its function. This domain is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to lysine residues
in the COOH terminus of p53, marking it for degradation. MDM2 and p53 regulate each other
3
through an autoregulatory feedback loop which is essential for cellular homeostasis and effective
response to various cellular stress.7,17,18 p53 induces the expression of MDM2, which in turn
inhibits p53 by promoting its degradation and nuclear export. This feedback mechanism ensures
that p53 activity is tightly controlled. Also, various DNA-damaging agents and oncogenes can
activate p53 by inducing phosphorylation of both p53 and MDM2, leading to disruption of their
interaction and stabilization of p53, thereby allowing it to perform its tumor-suppressive functions.
Due to the well-characterized structural and biological nature of the hydrophobic interaction
between p53 and MDM2, designing small lipophilic molecules that disrupt or inhibit this inter-
action has become a promising therapeutic approach. Notably, the MDM2 protein presents struc-
turally well-defined binding sites, whereas p53 undergoes dynamic conformational changes upon
phosphorylation. This suggests that inhibitors should more closely mimic p53 rather than MDM2.
Additionally, the p53 interface consists of a single short contiguous sequence of amino acids, mak-
ing it a suitable target for small-molecule inhibitors. The interaction between p53 and MDM2
involves only three hydrogen bonds, with the most critical bond being formed by TRP23 on p53.
The relatively small contact surface between these two proteins further supports the idea that small
inhibitory peptides or molecules could effectively disrupt their interaction.
Previous studies has suggested that azurin and its derived peptides possess significant anti-
cancer properties, demonstrating the ability to inhibit the growth and proliferation of various cancer
cell types.19–21 Some works have shown that the p28 peptide (a small peptide derived from azurin
having residues LEU50-ASP77 of azurin) can stabilize the p53 tumour suppressor protein, prevent-
ing its degradation and thereby arresting cancer cell growth.22,23 By binding to the DNA-binding
domain (DBD) of p53, p28 effectively shields it from cellular mechanisms that lead to its degra-
dation.24–27 Another study has shown that the binding of azurin to p53 significantly decreases the
association rate constant and binding affinity between MDM2 and p53, without blocking MDM2’s
access to p53’s binding pocket.28 Building on these findings, our study aims to investigate the
molecular interactions between the azurin-based peptide p28 and the cancer-related protein HDM2.
Specifically, we seek to uncover the mechanisms by which azurin exerts its anticancer effects, par-
ticularly through disrupting the HDM2-p53 interaction, a critical pathway in tumor suppression.
By focusing on the binding affinity and conformational dynamics of these complexes, we provide
deeper insights into the therapeutic potential of p28 as a promising peptide-based anticancer agent,
contributing to the development of novel treatments targeting HDM2-associated cancers.

Methods
As mentioned earlier, HDM2 acts as a downregulator of p53 by binding to its transactivation do-
main (TAD) which diminishes its tumor-suppressive function. In this study, we investigate the
4
interaction between the p28 peptide and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of HDM2, the region re-
sponsible for binding to the TAD of p53, which leads to p53 inhibition. Our approach includes
protein docking studies, molecular dynamics simulations, and energy calculations to evaluate the
binding affinity and stability of the HDM2-p28 complex.
2.1
Docking of HDM2 and p28 Peptide
We used the N-terminal domain (NTD) of HDM2 with a resolution of 1.8 Å obtained from the
RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6Q96) and extracted the p28 peptide fragment from the azurin
structure (PDB ID: 4AZU).29,30 Both the HDM2 NTD and the p28 peptide were equilibrated at
300 K and 1 bar pressure for 100 ns within the NPT ensemble. The final equilibrated structures
of HDM2 NTD and p28 peptide was then used for docking studies. Docking was performed using
the HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven protein-protein DOCKing) server, which generated the
top 10 most reliable clusters based on energy scores.31,32
The HADDOCK methodology integrates experimental data with computational docking, al-
lowing for the refinement of biomolecular complexes through a multi-stage approach. In this
study, the docking process followed a systematic approach to capture the interaction between the
p28 peptide and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of HDM2. A key feature of HADDOCK is the
use of Ambiguous Interaction Restraints (AIRs), which convert experimental data, such as NMR
or mutagenesis results, into distance restraints. These restraints are incorporated into the energy
function, guiding the docking calculations toward more accurate models.
The first step in the HADDOCK docking process involves randomization of orientations and
rigid-body minimization. the interacting partners, such as the p28 peptide and HDM2 NTD, are
treated as rigid bodies, meaning that all geometrical parameters (bond lengths, bond angles, and
dihedral angles) remain fixed. The molecules are separated in space and randomly rotated about
their centers of mass to explore possible configurations. Next, a rigid-body energy minimization
step is performed, allowing the partners to rotate and translate in order to optimize their interac-
tion, thereby identifying low-energy conformations for subsequent refinement. The second stage of
HADDOCK introduces flexibility to the interacting partners through a molecular dynamics-based
refinement process, enhancing interface packing. Initially, bond lengths and angles remain fixed,
while only the molecular orientations are optimized. Flexibility is then applied to the interface,
defined by intermolecular contacts within a 5 Å distance, allowing for a more accurate representa-
tion of the interactions at the binding site. Next, the side chains of the residues in this region are
allowed to relax in a second refinement step. Finally, both backbone and side-chain flexibility are
introduced, enabling more accurate conformational adjustments and a better representation of the
interaction at the binding site.
5
In the final phase of the docking, the complex is immersed in a solvent shell to improve interac-
tion energetics. The models undergo a brief molecular dynamics simulation at 300K, with position
restraints on the non-interface heavy atoms. These restraints are gradually relaxed, allowing the
side chains to adjust and optimize the interaction further.
HADDOCK employs a scoring system based on a combination of factors including van der
Waals forces, electrostatics, desolvation energies, and empirical restraints derived from experi-
mental data or predictions. In our analysis, the server generated a set of docking models, grouped
into clusters based on similarity. The top 10 clusters generated are ranked according to their HAD-
DOCK and Z-scores, reflecting the reliability and quality of each predicted binding mode.
2.2
MD Simulations of Docked Structures
Each of these structures was placed in a simulation box at a distance of 1.2 nm from the box walls
and solvated with water. Na+ and Cl−ions were added to neutralize the system and simulate
physiological salt concentrations. We employed the CHARMM36m force field parameters for the
protein chains and the TIP3P model for water molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations were
carried out using the GROMACS (GRoningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations) software suite,
a robust and highly efficient tool that is extensively utilized for advanced molecular dynamics
simulations.33
Energy minimization was performed using the steepest descent method to resolve steric clashes,
achieving convergence once the forces reached below 1000 kJ/mol/nm. The energy-minimized
structure was then equilibrated at 300 K in the NVT ensemble for 1 ns, followed by pressure equi-
libration at 1 bar in the NPT ensemble for 1 ns. The equilibrated system was then subjected to
a production run in the NVT ensemble for 200 ns, with data collected every picosecond. Tem-
perature and pressure were maintained at 300 K and 1 bar, respectively, using the Nosé-Hoover
thermostat34,35 with a relaxation time of 0.5 ps and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat36,37 with a re-
laxation time of 1.0 ps. All van der Waals interactions were truncated at a 1.2 nm cut-off, with the
neighbor list updated every ten steps, and electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME
(Particle-Mesh Ewald) method38 with the same cut-off. The LINCS (LINear Constraint Solver)
algorithm39 was used to constrain the bond lengths of hydrogen atoms. The trajectory was ana-
lyzed to evaluate the sustained interactions between HDM2 and p28. We found 3 structures that
adapt different binding poses and in which the p28 peptide effectively binds and masks the binding
pocket on HDM2 protein.

2.3
Subsequent Docking Studies with p53 TAD
The final structures of the above 3 clusters were subjected to a second docking study involving p53
TAD (residues 10-30) obtained from the human p53 structure in the UniProt database (ID: P04637).
This docking was performed to study the binding of p53 TAD to the HDM2-p28 complex. The
top clusters from these docking studies were analyzed to understand how the presence of the p28
peptide influences the binding modes of HDM2 with p53 TAD.

Results and Discussion
3.1
HADDOCK Scores of p28 Docking to HDM2
The docking of the p28 peptide with the N-terminal domain (NTD) of HDM2 yielded a total of
10 distinct cluster structures, highlighting various potential binding modes. In the rest of this
article, we refer to these structures as D1, D2, ..., D10. The best models from these top 10
HADDOCK clusters are presented in Figure 2. Interestingly, in many of these docked complexes,
the p28 peptide was found to bind near the region of the hydrophobic pocket of HDM2 NTD.
This hydrophobic pocket of HDM2 is known for its interaction with the transactivation domain
(TAD) of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, suggesting that p28 may potentially interfere with or
mimic this critical binding interface. (Native HDM2-p53 interaction sites and the hydrophobic
cleft are depicted in Figure 1.) These structures are ranked by the HADDOCK server based on
the HADDOCK scores, which quantify the overall docking energy as a weighted sum of various
interaction energy terms, and are presented in Table 1. The HADDOCK score is computed using
the following weighted energy equation.
HADDOCK Score = 1Evdw +0.2Eelec +1Edesolv +0.1EAIR

3.2
Structural Stability of HDM2-p28 Complexes
These structures were subjected to MD simulations at 300 K for 200 ns to assess the stability of the
interactions and to accommodate any conformational changes leading to the most favorable low-
energy binding interactions. These MD trajectories of the different equilibrated structures were
analyzed to evaluate the stability of various binding poses, sustained interactions and structural
behavior of the protein chains. First, the distance between the center of mass (COM) of the protein
chains of HDM2 and p28 was calculated to determine whether the p28 peptide continuously inter-
acts with HDM2 throughout the simulations. We found that in all 10 structures, p28 consistently

interacted with HDM2, maintaining proximity throughout the simulation. Next, we assessed the
temporal evolution of the backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) and the radius of gyration
(Rg) for both protein chains. HDM2 NTD exhibited minimal deviations compared to the initial
structure, indicating overall structural stability. The p28 peptide, on the other hand, predominantly
retained its folded α-helical structure, although slight structural melting was observed in a few
cases. We further calculated the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the residues forming
the hydrophobic pocket of HDM2 to identify which structures had the HDM2 binding site masked
by p28. Among all trajectories, the D1 trajectory showed slightly lower SASA values, indicating
more extensive masking of the hydrophobic pocket by p28 in this model.
We further analyzed the root mean square fluctuations of Cα carbon atoms (Cα-RMSF) of
individual residues in both protein chains for the last 50 ns of the MD trajectories. The analysis
showed that most of the residues of HDM2 remained structurally rigid, closely resembling their
native states under the simulated conditions. The p28 peptide exhibits slightly greater fluctuations,
as expected, reflecting its considerable structural flexibility. This flexibility may contribute to its
ability to adapt to various conformational states, allowing for dynamic interactions with HDM2.
In general, residues 5-25 of p28 remain significantly stable in their native α-helical structure,
probably with their interactions with HDM2. Only the N- and C-terminal residues exhibited higher
fluctuations. The p28 peptide in the D7 trajectory showed the highest fluctuations, where the
peptide was positioned away from HDM2 and partially unfolded. Similarly, in the D3 trajectory,
the p28 peptide exhibited significant structural melting.

Conformational Diversity of HDM2-p28 Complexes
After the 200 ns simulation, several docked complexes converged to similar binding modes. Three
pairs of such similar complexes were identified: D2-D6, D4-D10, and D5-D9. Upon analyzing

the binding regions in the final structures, we observed that in D1 and D2, the p28 peptide binds
near the active region of HDM2. However, in D2, the active site remains accessible. A similar
p28 conformation is observed in D6, where the active site is still open. In D3, the p28 peptide
is partially unfolded, failing to block the active region effectively. In D4, the N-terminal end of
p28, with its hydrophobic leucine residue, interacts with the hydrophobic pocket of HDM2. This
binding pattern is also seen in D10. In D5 and D9, p28 aligns perfectly within the hydrophobic

it effectively blocked the active site. Now, from these 10 complexes, we narrowed the selection to
three conformationally relevant structures that effectively block the hydrophobic pocket, display
structurally unique binding patterns, maintain sustained inter-chain interactions, and exhibit favor-
able binding energies. These are complexes D5, D8, and D4, which are further studied in-depth
for their various aspects of binding characteristics. The final binding poses of the p28 peptide with
HDM2 are depicted in Figure 5.

Contact Frequency Maps
In these three complexes, we calculated the contact frequency between interacting residues, which
is depicted as a contact frequency map in Figure 6. The contact frequency map represents the

probability of contacts between residues of HDM2 and p28, using data from the last 50 ns of the
MD trajectories. A contact between two residues is defined if the distance between any of their
heavy atoms is less than 4.5 Å. These contact maps provide valuable insights into the residues that
engage in favorable and sustained interactions between HDM2 and p28. Contact frequency maps
are helpful for understanding protein-protein interactions, as they highlight key residues involved
in stable binding interfaces. By analyzing these maps, we identified crucial interaction hotspots
between HDM2 and p28 and assessed how p28 modulates the binding region of HDM2, potentially
impacting its interaction with other cell growth regulatory proteins such as p53. The high contact
frequency regions suggest critical sites for the stabilization of the HDM2-p28 complex.
To compare the contacts between the p28 peptide and HDM2 with the native p53-HDM2 inter-
actions, we also mapped the contact frequency of the p53-HDM2 binding interface using the last 10
ns trajectory of a 100 ns simulation of this complex at 300 K. The key residues that form the native
HDM2-p53 interactions are predominantly hydrophobic, along with some other residues involved
in hydrogen bonding interactions. The region of the HDM2 N-terminal domain (NTD) involved
in these native interactions includes key residues within the range of 54-67, as well as residues 50,
72, 93, 96, and 99. Important hydrophobic residue pairs include LEU54-TRP23, ILE61-PHE19,
VAL93-LEU22, VAL93-TRP23, MET62-PHE19, ILE99-LEU26, LEU54-LEU26, ILE61-TRP23,
and LEU57-TRP23, where the first residue is from HDM2 and the second from p53. In addition,
residue pairs such as TYR67-SER15, GLN72-THR18, GLN72-GLN16, GLN72-SER15, MET62-
GLN16, and GLU25-ASN29 are involved in hydrogen bonding and polar interactions.
In the D4 docked complex, HDM2 residues 51, 52, 55-62, 67, 73, 93, and many others formed
stable interactions during the 200 ns simulation. The p28 peptide residues in the sequence range
of 1-4, 7-11, and 22-23 are involved in masking the hydrophobic pocket of HDM2 by interact-

In the D5 complex, the HDM2 residues at the binding interface were similar to those in the D4
complex. In the p28 peptide, residues 1-8, 10, 11, 15, 23, 24, and others were involved in crucial
contacts. Important hydrophobic and polar interactions include PHE55-SER2, VAL93-MET7,

Binding Energetics
Further, the Molecular Mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method was em-
ployed to evaluate the binding energetics of the HDM2-p28 docked complexes.40 This analysis

was conducted using the gmxMMPBSA package.41,42 MMPBSA is a widely used approach to es-
timate binding free energies by combining molecular mechanics (MM) energy terms with solvation
energies calculated via the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation and surface area (SA) contributions.
The binding free energy ∆Gbinding was computed as the difference between the free energies of
the complex, the receptor (HDM2), and the ligand (p28 peptide) as described in equation 2. The
total binding energy is derived from the sum of van der Waals, electrostatic, polar solvation, and
non-polar solvation components, providing insights into the energetic contributions stabilizing the
complexes. The calculations were based on snapshots extracted from the 200 ns molecular dy-
namics trajectories to capture representative conformations and interactions in each of the docked
complexes.

16
For the D4 complex, the MMPBSA binding energy was obtained to be −37.3±7.87 kcal/mol,
and for the D5 and D8 complexes, it was found to be −41.92±4.49 kcal/mol and −41.57±6.91
kcal/mol, respectively. These highly negative interaction energies indicate a strong affinity of the
p28 peptide for the hydrophobic pocket of HDM2 NTD, potentially hindering its association with
the p53 protein. The consistency of the binding energies across the complexes suggests that the
p28 peptide consistently stabilizes its interaction with HDM2, thereby potentially disrupting the
normal binding of HDM2 to its native substrates. This analysis helped to quantify the energetic
favorability of the different binding modes observed in the D4, D5, and D8 complexes (Figure 10).

with p53 TAD, labeled as D4-P53, D5-P53 and D8-P53. These structures indicate that, in the
presence of the p28 peptide, HDM2 is unable to interact with the p53 TAD. The HDM2 N-terminal
domain (NTD) is colored green, the p28 peptide is shown in red, and the p53 transactivation
domain (TAD) is depicted in blue.

Docking of HDM2, p28 and p53 TAD Protein Chains
Further, we explored these different configurations to understand how they interact with p53 TAD
by performing a second docking of the HDM2-p28 complex with p53 TAD. From the HADDOCK
cluster structures, we observed that due to the presence of the p28 peptide at the HDM2 binding
pocket, HDM2 is unable to interact with p53, making only limited contacts between p53 TAD
and its own other solvent-exposed regions. We depict snapshots of the best models obtained from
this docking, labeled as D4-P53, D5-P53, and D8-P53, in Figure 10. This highlights the efficacy
of the p28 peptide in preserving the transcriptional activity of the p53 protein. Additionally, we
performed another docking of these with all three protein chains simultaneously. The results from
the top clusters, scored by HADDOCK, revealed that the p28 peptide consistently binds to the
17
hydrophobic pocket of HDM2, thereby preventing HDM2 from binding to the p53 TAD. The top
5 structures from this docking of the three protein chains, labeled as 3P1, 3P2, 3P3, 3P4 and 3P5
are shown in Figure 11.

Conclusions
This study aimed to understand the mechanisms underlying the suppression of tumor cell growth
by the p28 peptide from azurin, focusing on its interactions with the cancer-related protein HDM2.
We investigated various possibilities of p28 peptide binding to HDM2 using a combination of
docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and detailed analysis of the resulting docked
18
structures. Our findings reveal that the HDM2 N-terminal domain (NTD) preferentially interacts
with the p28 peptide, thereby preventing HDM2 from binding to the p53 protein. This preservation
of p53’s transcriptional activity is crucial for regulating cancer cell growth and apoptosis.
From the 200 ns MD simulations of the best docked HDM2-p28 complexes, several structures
converged to similar low-energy binding modes. Among these, three complexes, D4, D5, and
D8, emerged with distinct binding modes, maintaining sustained inter-chain interactions that ef-
fectively block the hydrophobic pocket of HDM2. A detailed analysis of the contact interfaces
identified residues 54-72 and 93-99 of HDM2 as critical for its interaction with p53, and the p28
peptide effectively interacts with these residues, potentially hindering HDM2 from binding p53.
We employed the MMPBSA method to evaluate the binding stability of these complexes, which
showed favorable binding energies in the range of −37.0 to −42.0 kcal/mol, indicating strong and
stable interactions. Furthermore, a subsequent docking of the final MD structures of the HDM2-
p28 complexes with p53 TAD demonstrated that in the presence of p28, HDM2 could not interact
with p53. Additional studies by simultaneous docking of HDM2, p28, and p53 TAD confirmed
that the p28 peptide preferentially binds to the hydrophobic pocket of HDM2 rather than p53 TAD.
Overall, these studies revealed the molecular basis for the effective anticancer properties of the
p28 peptide, highlighting its potential to inhibit HDM2’s interaction with p53 and thereby preserve
p53’s tumor-suppressing functions. This insight could be valuable in developing targeted cancer
therapies involving peptide-based inhibitors like p28.
