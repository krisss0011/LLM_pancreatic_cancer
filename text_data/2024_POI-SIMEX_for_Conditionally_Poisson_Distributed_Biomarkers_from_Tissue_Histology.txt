Covariate measurement error in regression analysis is an important issue that has been studied extensively
under the classical additive and the Berkson error models. Here, we consider cases where covariates are
derived from tumor tissue histology, and in particular tissue microarrays. In such settings, biomarkers are
evaluated from tissue cores that are subsampled from a larger tissue section so that these biomarkers are
only estimates of the true cell densities. The resulting measurement error is non-negligible but is seldom
accounted for in the analysis of cancer studies involving tissue microarrays.
To adjust for this type of measurement error, we assume that these discrete-valued biomarkers are con-
ditionally Poisson distributed, based on a Poisson process model governing the spatial locations of marker-
positive cells. Existing methods for addressing conditional Poisson surrogates, particularly in the absence
of internal validation data, are limited. We extend the simulation extrapolation (SIMEX) algorithm to ac-
commodate the conditional Poisson case (POI-SIMEX), where measurement errors are non-Gaussian with
heteroscedastic variance. The proposed estimator is shown to be strongly consistent in a linear regression
model under the assumption of a conditional Poisson distribution for the observed biomarker.
Simulation studies evaluate the performance of POI-SIMEX, comparing it with the naive method and an
alternative corrected likelihood approach in linear regression and survival analysis contexts. POI-SIMEX
is then applied to a study of high-grade serous cancer, examining the association between survival and the
presence of triple-positive biomarker (CD3+CD8+FOXP3+ cells).

Introduction
The presence of covariate measurement error in regression analysis can distort the estimated coefﬁcients,
leading to biased estimators with increased variance (Carroll et al., 2006; Fuller, 1986). This issue is
generally well-studied, but there is limited work considering situations where the observed covariates are
discrete and follow a Poisson distribution conditional on the true covariate. This situation arises when
biomarkers are derived from cell counts, as is common in the analysis of histological sections and tumor
tissue microarrays (TMAs) used in cancer studies.
Understanding and correcting for the approximate nature of the observed biomarker in this context is
crucial for ensuring better accuracy and reliability of statistical analyses for studies involving TMAs, such
as those involving measurements of immune cells in cancer, where measurement error and the discrete

nature of the observed surrogate are often not considered. We take into account this speciﬁc context
and make the following contributions: 1) the formulation of a conditional Poisson biomarker model for
TMA-based biomarkers; 2) extension of the simulation extrapolation (SIMEX) method to the Poisson
case (POI-SIMEX), where the variance of the measurement error is heteroscedastic and only a single
replicate of the observed covariate may be available; 3) establishing conditions for strong consistency of
the POI-SIMEX estimator in the case of linear regression; 4) evaluation of the POI-SIMEX estimator
in both simulations and an application to a survival analysis of high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC).
These simulations demonstrate that the POI-SIMEX estimator effectively adjusts for measurement error
and performs generally better than competing methodology; 5) companion R software for POI-SIMEX is
available on GitHub (https://github.com/Aijunyan/POI-SIMEX).
The literature on adjustments for covariate measurement error is substantial and includes book-length
reviews by Fuller (1986), Carroll et al. (2006), and Yi et al. (2021). Given the current methodology,
approaches for handling conditional Poisson surrogates in contexts lacking validation data where regres-
sion calibration cannot be applied have been largely overlooked. These approaches become particularly
important when biomarkers are derived from tissue cores subsampled from a larger tissue area, making
these biomarkers mere estimates of true cell densities. The resulting measurement error is signiﬁcant but
is seldom addressed in cancer studies involving tissue microarrays.
Regression analysis and measurement error modeling approaches often rely on classical errors-in-
variables models. These methods attempt to correct bias by explicitly modeling measurement errors in the
independent variables, usually assuming Gaussian distributed errors. Regression calibration (Spiegelman et al. ,
1997) is commonly used for bias correction in settings where internal validation data are available.
Nakamura (1990) discusses the corrected score function approach for generalized linear models and
shows that the solution to the unbiased score equations will yield a consistent estimator. Li et al. (2004)
adopt this approach and derive the corrected score function for linear regression with Poisson-distributed
covariates. They derive explicit forms for the solutions to the corrected score equation, under the assump-
tion that the true covariate, the mean of the observed covariate, follows a Gamma distribution.
Bayesian methods incorporate prior information and better allow for uncertainty quantiﬁcation with
ﬁnite sample inference. A Bayesian approach to covariate measurement error can be formulated directly
by treating the true covariates as missing data and using data augmentation (Richardson and Gilks , 1993).
On the other hand, nonparametric regression techniques (Carroll et al., 1999, 2009), like kernel regression,
spline smoothing, and Dirichlet process mixtures (Sarkar , 2014; Sinha and Wang , 2017), offer ﬂexibility
without assuming speciﬁc functional or distributional forms.
Among existing methods, simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) requires only weak assumptions about the
distribution of the true predictor and has been extended in several directions (Cook , 1994; Carroll et al.,
1995). Kuchenhoff et al.(2006) develop misclassiﬁcation simulation-extrapolation (MC-SIMEX) to deal
with measurement error for categorical variables. Parveen et al. (2021) extend SIMEX to allow for
non-zero mean measurement error. In certain situations where the variance of the measurement error
is unknown, and it is heteroscedastic, Devanarayan and Stefanski (2002) propose an empirical SIMEX
estimator where the pseudo errors are generated from random linear contrasts of the observed replicate
measurements. A comprehensive review of SIMEX and related developments is presented in Sevilimedu
and Yu (2022).
In survival analysis, also known as time-to-event analysis, the goal is to model the time until a speciﬁed
event occurs. However, the presence of measurement error in covariates, which are used as predictors of the
time-to-event outcome, can complicate this analysis. Measurement error can lead to biased estimates and
incorrect inference if not properly addressed. To correct for measurement error in survival analysis, vari-
ous methods have been adapted and developed for different models and assumptions (Carroll et al., 2006).
In the context of the Cox proportional hazards model, Nakamura (1992), introduces a corrected score
method to account for measurement error. This method has since been reﬁned by subsequent research to
improve estimation under various assumptions and conditions (Kongetal et al., 1998; Kong and Gu , 1999;

Augustin, 2004; Yi and Lawless , 2007; Yan and Yi , 2015). More recently, Cao and Wong (2022) pro-
poses an approximate proﬁle likelihood estimation approach, offering an alternative to the corrected score
method. Another widely used technique is the regression calibration (RC) method, which involves replac-
ing the mismeasured covariate with an estimated version derived from a calibration model. This approach
has been discussed in detail by Prentice (1982) and later by Wang et al.(2008), providing a straightforward
solution when the measurement error is relatively small. For parametric models, such as parametric ac-
celerated failure time (AFT) models, He et al. (2007) utilizes SIMEX technique and introduces a ﬂexible
approach that allows for non-linear relationships between covariates and the time-to-event outcome. The
SIMEX method has also been applied to AFT models in other studies (Zhang et al., 2014; Greene and Cai ,
2004). Recently, Bayesian approaches have gained attention in addressing measurement error in time-to-
event analysis. Tang (2022) proposes a Bayesian framework for AFT models with measurement error in
covariates, offering a ﬂexible alternative that can incorporate prior information and address complex error
structures. Bayesian methods are particularly valuable when dealing with small sample sizes or when prior
knowledge about the measurement error is available.
Our methodological development is motivated by studies investigating the prognostic signiﬁcance of
tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes with TMAs, and our example application considers this in a study of HGSC.
HGSC remains the deadliest gynecological malignancy primarily because of its early spread and the de-
velopment of resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy Havasi et al. (2023). There is thus a critical
need for dependable biomarkers that complement clinical data to support advances in patient care. These
biomarkers are typically measured through sub-sampling a single disease site; therefore, they are prone to
measurement errors arising from TMA construction, and leading to non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic mea-
surement errors associated with discrete biomarkers. The corrected score estimator for Poisson surrogates
proposed by Li et al. is limited to linear regression. In contrast, SIMEX can be applied more broadly, but
it has yet to be developed for conditionally Poisson-distributed surrogates. As far as we are aware, there is
no theoretical justiﬁcation for using SIMEX within this context. Initiating a theoretical justiﬁcation for an
appropriately devised SIMEX (POI-SIMEX) in this setting is one of our primary contributions.
Subsequent sections of the paper proceed as follows. Section 2 presents an introduction to TMA-
based biomarkers and describes the mechanisms that lead to measurement error. Section 3 focuses on the
Poisson error model framework and SIMEX estimation, including model formulation, demonstration of
estimation bias if measurement error is ignored, and the proposed POI-SIMEX estimator. In Section 4, we
establish the strong consistency of the POI-SIMEX estimator in simple linear regression for a conditionally
Poisson-distributed observed covariate. Section 5 presents the results from simulation studies, followed by
an application to our motivating study in Section 6. The paper concludes with a discussion of our results,
including the relevance to both statistical methodology and cancer research.

Tissue Microarrays and Cancer Biomarkers
Patients diagnosed with cancer have traditionally received standardized treatment protocols, however, it is
now clear that unique characteristics of a patient’s tumor can guide tailored therapies even among cases
of the same cancer type. Beyond clinically-approved biomarkers, such as the expression of PD-L1 by
cancer and tumor inﬁltrating immune cells, biomarker characterization has become increasingly important
to guide research and clinical development. Many studies investigate associations between certain cell
types and patient outcomes. At the same time, advances in digital pathology are leading to increasingly
quantitative characterization of tissue biomarkers that go beyond binary positive or negative status for a
given marker. The consideration of measurement error for these biomarkers is of great importance.
Tissue microarrays are widely used in cancer research because they enable the high-throughput analy-
sis of multiple tissue samples on a single slide, signiﬁcantly increasing research efﬁciency and reducing

costs. TMAs ensure consistency and standardization in sample processing, enhancing reliability and re-
producibility. They also conserve valuable tissue specimens by using small cores and allow for compre-
hensive biomarker analysis, facilitating the validation of known markers, the discovery of new markers and
the analysis of marker interaction. Their ability to utilize archival tissue further supports their extensive
application in cancer research (Kononen et al., 1998).
Tissue cores are extracted by puncturing solid tissue using a circular needle typically ranging from
0.6 mm to 4.0 mm in diameter, depending on tissue availability, resulting in only small subregions of
tumors that are sampled as cores. Consequently, a TMA will only approximate the cell density of interest
(BioChain Institute, 2024). In addition, these measures are discrete rather than continuous as they are
computed based on cell counts. The resulting measurement error is non-negligible and the discrete nature
of the observed covariate makes this a challenging problem that is rarely considered in the analysis of
TMAs. Figure 1 (A) illustrates a TMA sample construction (Eskaros et al., 2017). In this case, a TMA
core (red circle) with area A and biomarker cell count W is extracted from a whole donor tissue (denoted
as T) with an area AT and a total biomarker cell count WT , where A << AT . Inaccuracies can arise
when analyzing marker expression based on these core counts and core areas leading to bias and inﬂated
variance in regression analysis when TMA-based biomarkers are incorporated into a regression analysis.

Poisson Error Model Framework
3.1
Error model assumptions
We model Y , the response variable, as a function of X, the true biomarker of interest, where X typically
represents cell density WT /AT over a larger tissue area, which cannot be measured directly with TMAs.
Instead, the variable W, representing the biomarker cell count of the selected TMA core with area A is
measured. The estimated or observed cell density is W/A and is used as the surrogate for WT /AT . Other

covariates Z are assumed to be measured without error. Cell locations within a tissue sample are assumed
to be distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson process with intensity X = WT
AT . Under the Poisson
process model for the cell distribution we have for subject i,
Wi|Xi ind
∼Poisson(XiAi) i = 1, ..., N,
(1)
where Xi is the unobserved true tissue cell density for the ith subject and Wi is the observed number of
cells on the core with area Ai. Thus, E[Wi|Xi] = V ar[Wi|Xi] = AiXi, and E[Wi] = AiE[Xi]. We note
that the model is Poisson conditional on Xi, and so overdispersion in the observed Wi does not preclude
the use of this model.
In what follows, we assume (Yi, Zi, Wi, Ai, Xi), corresponding to the response, covariate without mea-
surement error, observed cell count, observed core area, and true cell density, respectively, are independent
across subjects i = 1, ...N. For simplicity, we illustrate the conditional Poisson measurement error model
in the context of a linear model and assume both Xi and Zi are scalars. We then have
Yi = β0 + βXXi + βZZi + ǫi, ǫi i.i.d
∼N(0, σ2
ǫ), Wi|Xi ind
∼Poisson(XiAi),
(2)
where Xi > 0 is the true cell density, and (Yi, Zi, Wi, Ai) i = 1, ..., N are the observed data. We ﬁrst
discuss asymptotic bias for the case when Xi is replaced by Wi/Ai, the so-called naive estimator.

Thus, analogous to the case of the additive measurement error model, we see the asymptotic bias of the
naive estimator in the case of a conditional Poisson model for the observed covariate in a linear regression
analysis.
3.3
The SIMEX algorithm for Poisson distributed surrogates
The SIMEX algorithm, introduced by Cook and Stefanski in 1994 (Cook , 1994), is commonly employed
to correct the bias from measurement error in regression analysis, operating under certain assumptions
regarding the measurement error structure. In practice, the standard SIMEX algorithm assumes the mea-
surement error follows an additive structure with errors distributed as N(0, σ2), where σ2 is either known
or estimated. The standard SIMEX method involves three main steps: simulation, estimation, and extrap-
olation. In the simulation step, additional measurement error is artiﬁcially introduced into the data. In the
estimation step, the model’s parameters are estimated repeatedly with varying levels of introduced error.
Finally, in the extrapolation step, the relationship between the introduced error and the estimated param-
eters is analyzed, and this information is used to extrapolate the estimators back to the scenario with no
measurement error.
In departing with standard SIMEX methodology, the non-Gaussian measurement error structure in our
setup is Ui =
Wi
Ai −Xi, where Wi is assumed conditionally Poisson, Ai is ﬁxed and known, and the
distribution of Xi is continuous but unspeciﬁed. In addition, the measurement error variance is not constant
and varies across subjects. Thus our model lies outside the standard assumptions within which SIMEX
is applied (Carroll and Stefanski, 1997). Remarkably, the use of Gaussian pseudo errors in the proposed
SIMEX algorithm produces an estimator that exhibits strong consistency (Theorem 1) and uniformly better
ﬁnite sample performance in terms of MSE than existing methodology for Poisson covariates based on
corrected score equations (Li et al., 2004) (Section 5.1). We further do not assume any replication of the
biomarkers or knowledge of the measurement error variance, so our framework is broadly applicable.

In the simulation step, we simulate b = 1, ..., B new sets of the observed covariate Wi,b(λ) = Wi +
λ1/2ˆσiUi,b by adding Gaussian error λ1/2 ˆσiUi,b, where ˆσ2
i is an estimate of V AR[Wi/Ai −Xi] and
Ui,b i.i.d
∼N(0, 1). The variance of the total measurement error in Wi,b(λ) is σ2
i (1 + λ). The regression
coefﬁcient estimates of Wi,b(λ), ˆβλ,b are computed for each of the B simulated datasets, and the average of
these estimates 1
B
PB
b=1 ˆβλ,b is computed as an approximation to EU[ˆβλ,b|Y, W]. These computations are
repeated over a grid of λ values. After the simulation step, one analyzes how the computed expectations
vary as λ changes by ﬁtting a functional form, such as linear, quadratic, or nonlinear. The SIMEX estimator
is obtained by extrapolating the resulting curve to the value corresponding to the absence of measurement
error, i.e., when λ = −1, σ2
i (1 + λ) = 0; thus, the variance of the total measurement error is 0.
The implementation of SIMEX requires estimation of σ2
i , the variance of the measurement error for
subject i, i=1,...,N. A key aspect of our proposed POI-SIMEX and an important issue for TMA data is
consistent estimation of the heteroskedastic measurement error variance from the observed data with only
a single TMA replicate.

so that ˆσ2

3.4
Variance estimation of the SIMEX estimator
The variance (σ2
βSIMEX) of the SIMEX estimator is comprised of two components: the sampling variance
of the ˆβλ estimates obtained at each λ value, denoted as ˆη2
β(λ), and the variance of ˆβλ derived using
its information matrix at each level of λ, denoted as ˆσ2
β(λ). Carroll et al.(2006) suggest computing this
variance by extrapolating the difference of ˆσ2
β(λ) −ˆη2
β(λ) to λ = −1. We illustrate this procedure in the
one covariate case. In a simulation step, for a given λ and the bth simulated dataset (b = 1, .., B), let
ˆβλ,b and ˆσ2
β(λ, b) be the naive estimator of the bth simulation for a given λ and its corresponding variance
estimator. We obtain B estimates of ˆβλ,b and ˆσ2
β(λ, b) from B simulated datasets. Then, we estimate ˆσ2
β(λ)
by
PB
b=1 ˆσ2
β(λ,b)
B
, and ˆη2
β(λ) is the sample variance of the ˆβλ,b, b = 1, . . . , B. We apply extrapolation to
the ﬁtted function of positive ˆσ2
diff(λ) = ˆσ2
β(λ) −ˆη2
β(λ) versus λ values. The estimated variance of the
SIMEX estimator is then ˆσ2
βSIMEX = ˆσ2
diff(λ = −1).
Another approach to estimating the variance of the SIMEX estimator is proposed by Lin and Carroll
(2000), who employ the sandwich formula for variance estimation of the naive estimate. This method then
adjusts the result by multiplying it with a factor incorporating the extrapolation function to accommodate
for extrapolation. It is well known that the bootstrap (Efron , 1979) method can estimate the variance
robustly. The variance estimate from the ﬁrst approach is compared to that obtained using the bootstrap in
our application.

Consistency of the SIMEX estimator with Conditionally Poisson-distributed
surrogates in simple Linear Regression
Carroll et al. (1996; 1997) develop the asymptotic theory for SIMEX under the Gaussian and additive
measurement error model framework. In this section, we demonstrate the consistency of the SIMEX
estimator in simple linear regression models with conditionally Poisson-distributed surrogates. Let Yi =

The SIMEX estimator for simple linear regression with conditional Poisson measurement error is therefore
strongly consistent when σ2 is known.

We have Cov[X, U] = 0, Cov[ǫ, W] = 0, Cov[ǫ, U] = 0, Cov[W, U] = 0 so that ˆβ1,U(λ)

→β1Cov[X,W]
Var[W]+λσ2 .
Now, under the conditional Poisson measurement error model,
given Var[W] = E[V ar[W|X]] + V ar[E[W|X]] = E[X] + V ar[X] and Cov[X, W] = E[XW] −
E[X]E[W] = E[E[XW|X]] −E[X]E[W] = E[XE[W|X]] −E[X]E[E[W|X]] = E[X2] −E2[X] =
V ar[X], hence, ˆβ1,U(λ)

β1V ar[X]
V ar[X]+E[X]+λσ2 .
Then, note that σ2 = V ar[Wi −Xi] = E[V ar[Wi −Xi|Xi]] + V ar[E[Wi −Xi|Xi]] = E[Xi], so
ˆβ1,U(λ)

Therefore, we have from Equation 3

so that ˆβSIMEX,σ is strongly consistent for β0, β1 when σ is known.
Corollary
Under the conditions of Theorem (1) and Proposition (1) with Ai = 1, we have that ˆβSIMEX,ˆσ with
ˆσ2 = ¯
W, is strongly consistent. The proof proceeds in the same way as that of Theorem (4.1), with ¯W
replacing σ2 and further application of Slutsky’s theorem when taking the limit.

Simulation studies
Simulation studies are carried out to empirically evaluate the bias and mean squared error (MSE) of POI-
SIMEX, the estimator obtained using the true covariate, the Naive estimator, and the Adj-LM approach
proposed by Li et al. (2004). We use a consistent estimator of the measurement error variance, based
on Proposition (3.1), when implementing POI-SIMEX and adopt a quadratic extrapolant function (Cook ,

Yang A. et al. and 2024-10-25: POI-SIMEX
1994). An extensive range of settings are considered, including those considered in Li et al. and various
other settings based on ratios of the variance of the true covariate and the observed covariate. These ratios
inversely represent the relative magnitude of the measurement error in the observed covariate.
5.1
Simulation settings in Li et al.
The data are simulated assuming the linear regression model (2) and the observed count W in an area
A follows a Poisson distribution with the mean deﬁned as the product of the true covariate (X) and the
area (A). Hence, the surrogate for the true covariate is W/A where W ∼Poisson(XA). For simplicity,
the area A is set to 1 in the simulations. In addition to the covariate with measurement error, there is
another covariate Z measured without error generated from a uniform distribution between 0.5 and 9.
The coefﬁcients associated with the intercept, covariate with measurement error and without measurement
error, respectively β0, βX, βZ, are set to 2, 1, and 0.5, following Li et al. (2004). The sample size N
is set to be 50, 100, or 200. The standard deviation of the error (σǫ) in the regression model is set to 5.
Three scenarios are considered: Xi’s are generated independently from a Gamma distribution with shape
parameter, a, and scale parameter, b as follows: (1) a = 1 and b = 2; (2) a = 1 and b =10; (3) a = 2 and b =
Zi. In the third case, the two covariates, X and Z, are dependent, as one of the parameters used to simulate
Xi is set to Zi.
In all instances, the bias and mean squared error (MSE), along with their associated Monte Carlo (MC)
standard errors, are reported from 1000 simulated data sets using the batch mean method with ten batches.
The results for all estimated β′s and methods are summarized in Tables 1, 2, and 3. In all settings, POI-
SIMEX and Adj-LM outperform the Naive method. In scenarios 1 and 2, POI-SIMEX consistently out-
performs Adj-LM, exhibiting lower MSE and bias across all settings. In scenario 3, POI-SIMEX performs
better than Adj-LM with smaller MSE and bias for N=50 and N=100. For N=200, POI-SIMEX has a
smaller MSE but a slightly larger bias than Adj-LM. Overall, POI-SIMEX emerges as a better method
for dealing with Poisson surrogates in linear regression. However, perhaps the greatest advantage of POI-
SIMEX over Adj-LM is that it can be easily adapted to settings with censoring or non-linear regression
settings while Adj-LM cannot and is based explicitly on linear regression. This is demonstrated in Section
5.2.
We also perform simulation studies to investigate the performance under different ratios, deﬁned as the
ratio of the variance of true covariate (σ2
X) and the variance of the observed covariate (σ2
W ). The data
are simulated using the settings described above, except that the Gamma shape and scale parameters are
chosen such that the ratio, deﬁned as σ2
X
σ2
W [=ab2/(ab + ab2)] in the conditional Poisson error model given
the Gamma distributed true covariate, are (1) r = 0.9, for a = 0.1, b = 9; (2) r = 0.75, for a = 2/3, b = 3;
(3) r = 0.5, for a = 2, b = 1. The sample size N is 100.
For each setting, the bias and MSE, and their Monte Carlo standard errors, are reported for 1000 data
sets. The results corresponding to the covariate with measurement error are summarized in Table 4.
In scenario 1, when the variance of the true covariate is relatively large compared to its mean, the
Naive method has the smallest MSE but a signiﬁcant bias. If we consider both MSE and bias, POI-
SIMEX exhibits the second smallest MSE and the smallest bias. In scenario 2, POI-SIMEX outperforms
the Adj-LM method with the smallest MSE and bias. In scenario 3, the Adj-LM method has the largest
MSE, whereas POI-SIMEX has the smallest MSE. Overall, POI-SIMEX is recommended for correcting
measurement errors in settings such as Scenario 1 and 2, where the average biomarker density is small with
considerable variation.
In the Appendix we report on four additional simulation studies that investigate performance under
model misspeciﬁcation, where the observed covariate conditional on the true covariate is drawn from either
a binomial distribution (two studies) or a negative binomial distribution (two studies) and the conditional
Poisson approach is applied. All four studies represent very strong deviations from the model assumptions,
with the speciﬁc simulation settings and results reported in Appendix Tables 1 to 4. As might be expected,
the performance of both approaches based on the conditional Poisson assumption exhibit performance

degradation under strong forms of model misspeciﬁcation. Even in these cases, however, we observe that
the degradation of POI-SIMEX is generally less severe than the degradation of Adj-LM, and thus it exhibits
better performance under misspeciﬁcation as well.
5.2
Simulation with log-normal censored survival data
We evaluate the performance of POI-SIMEX with data generated using an accelerated failure time survival
model with a conditionally Poisson-distributed error-prone covariate. We simulate log-normal survival
times with 20 percent random censoring. The Poisson rate Xis are generated independently from a Gamma
distribution with shape parameter, a = 1, and scale parameter, b = 2. The scale parameter (σ) for the log-
normal distribution of the error is set to 2. The covariate without measurement error, Z, is drawn from a
uniform distribution between 0.5 and 9. The intercept and coefﬁcients associated with log survival time
are β0 = 2, βx = 1, and βz = 0.5. The sample size N is 50, 100, or 200. In all instances, the bias, mean
squared error (MSE), and their Monte Carlo standard errors, are reported from 1000 datasets generated.
The results for all parameters are summarized in Table 5. We compare POI-SIMEX only with the Naive
method as Adj-LM can not be applied in settings with censoring. However, POI-SIMEX is easily adapted
to this and other regression settings with Poisson surrogates. The POI-SIMEX method outperforms the
Naive method with a smaller bias and mean squared error (MSE) in all scenarios. For instance, when
N = 50, the bias correction is signiﬁcant for the intercept term (β0), the coefﬁcient of the error-prone
covariate (βX), and the scale parameter (σ). With β0 = 2, the naive method has an average estimate of
3.105, while POI-SIMEX has an average estimate of 2.596. For βX = 1, the naive method has an average
estimate of 0.673, whereas POI-SIMEX has an average estimate of 0.914. For σ = 2, the Naive method
gives an average estimate of 2.364, and POI-SIMEX gives an average estimate of 2.160. Similar patterns
are observed for N = 100 and N = 200. Both methods closely estimate the βZ, as expected due to the
assumed independence between covariates.

Application to the COEUR HGSC cohort
Despite being ten times less common than breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) ranks as the
ﬁfth-leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in Canada (Arora et al., 2018). Over the past
decade, advancements in therapeutic targets and drug developments have notably increased survival rates.
However, despite these improvements, patients’ survival rates and the overall quality of life remain sub-
optimal. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is a subtype of EOC. Epithelial ovarian cancer is a broad
category of cancers that arise from the epithelial cells covering the surface of the ovaries or, as current
research suggests, the fallopian tube (Labidi et al. , 2017). It includes several subtypes, with high-grade
serous carcinoma being one of the most common and aggressive forms. Thus, there is a pressing need
to ﬁnd biomarkers that are relevant to survival. COEUR comprises 12 ovarian cancer biobanks across
Canada. This repository includes a central retrospective cohort of over 2,000 patient tissue samples with
associated clinical data, of which 1,246 are HGSC. Our study cohort of 716 is a subset of the HGSC
samples, that only includes patients with linked TMA data, complete clinical information, and demo-
graphic details such as treatment, survival, or follow-up time. We apply multivariable linear regression,
assuming the log survival time is normally distributed and correct the bias in coefﬁcient estimation using
POI-SIMEX. Table (6) displays summary statistics of subject characteristics stratiﬁed by death status, and
Kaplan-Meier survival curves in Figure (2) show that optimal debulking, early FIGO stage (I or II), and
presenting CD3+CD8+FoxP3+ ∼E (∼E refers to the cells measured in epithelial regions) are positively
associated with survival.
The CD3+CD8+FoxP3+ ∼E triple-positive biomarker, derived from TMA data, highlights the critical
role of immune cell inﬁltration, such as tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which are key prognostic
indicators for survival across various cancers. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), characterized by FoxP3 expres-
sion, are primarily recognized for their immunosuppressive function, maintaining immune homeostasis by

downregulating immune responses and preventing autoimmunity. However, in the tumor microenviron-
ment, Tregs’ suppressive activity can hinder anti-tumor immunity, often correlating with poor prognosis
(Curiel et al., 2004; Curiel, 2008; Elkoshi, 2022). In some cancer subtypes, including ovarian cancer, im-
mune inﬁltration has been linked to overall prognosis. Speciﬁcally, CD8+FoxP3+ T cells have been sug-
gested to form a unique regulatory population with suppressive effects on inﬁltrating B cells(Preston et al.,
2013; Liston and Aloulou, 2022; Warfvinge et al, 2017). In advanced-stage ovarian cancer, the presence of
CD8+ cells, FoxP3+ Tregs, or a high CD8/FoxP3 ratio in tumor tissue has been linked to improved disease-
speciﬁc survival Leffers et al. (2009). Similarly, in high-grade serous tumors from optimally debulked
patients, disease-speciﬁc survival was positively correlated with CD8 and FoxP3 markers (Milne et al.,
2009). Nevertheless, the speciﬁc impact of these triple-positive cells on HGSC patient survival remains
unclear and and we hope that the results from applying POI-SIMEX will provide further insights. Notably,
the estimated coefﬁcient of the biomarker obtained from POI-SIMEX is larger than the estimate obtained
from the naive model with a slightly increased standard error relative to the naive approach (Table 7). We
have added the standard error from the bootstrap method to the POI-SIMEX estimator, which is compara-
ble with the standard error obtained using SIMEX and its standard variance estimation. As shown in Table
7, for each unit increase in the density (per mm2) of CD3+CD8+FoxP3+ ∼E, the estimated increase in
log survival time is 0.0148 (SE:0.0053), given that the other covariates are held ﬁxed. Compared to the
naive method, this represents a relative increase in the estimated regression coefﬁcient of approximately
25 percent. There is clearly a non-trivial correction to the estimate associated with the biomarker.

Conclusion
Motivated by the importance of adjusting for measurement error in TMA-based studies of cancer, we
develop POI-SIMEX, an adjustment approach for handling conditionally Poisson-distributed surrogates,
and applied it to linear regression models and parametric accelerated failure time survival models. For
cases with unknown measurement error variance, our proposed method only requires one replicate to obtain
a strongly consistent estimate of the measurement error variance for POI-SIMEX. Our simulation studies

show that the proposed method outperforms the correction method proposed in Li et al. (2004) within
the setting of linear regression and also has broad applicability for the analysis of TMAs beyond linear
regression. The POI-SIMEX approach is also appealing as it does not require speciﬁcation of the true
covariate process. While performance degradation is observed under model misspeciﬁcation, the degree of
degradation is less severe than that of competing methodology.
Biologically, the ﬁnding that CD3+CD8+FOXP3+ T cells are associated with increased overall sur-
vival is intriguing. One might speculate that these FOXP3+ T cells mediate direct killing of tumor cells,
as FOXP3 is a marker of T cell activation. Alternatively, these cells could play an immunoregulatory
role by reducing inﬂammatory signals such as TNF-a, a critical tumor factor, thereby indirectly block-
ing tumor growth and metastasis (Ostrand-Rosenberg, 2010). It may also be possible that these cells
limit the activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009).
Further func-
tional studies are needed clarify these potential scenarios (Liu et al., 2015). While this paper has ini-
tiated the theoretical justiﬁcation for POI-SIMEX, more general theory including the consideration of
POI-SIMEX for semiparametric survival modeling with the Cox proportional hazard model is part of
ongoing work. By providing detailed performance metrics, some theoretical results, and comparative
analysis with real data, we provide an approach for improving the analysis of TMA-based studies of
biomarkers, immunology and cancer survival. Companion R code for POI-SIMEX is available on GitHub
(https://github.com/Aijunyan/POI-SIMEX).

Appendix
To evaluate the model performance under misspeciﬁcation, we conduct two simulation studies to evaluate
the model’s performance when the conditional Poisson assumption does not hold for covariates with mea-
surement error. The same parameters from Section 5.1 are used. However, we assume one scenario where
observations are drawn from a binomial distribution and another from a negative binomial distribution with
the mean set to the true covariate.
