Abstract 
Infrared (IR) dyes, especially those within the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, offer substantial advantages for in vivo 
imaging, owing to their deep tissue penetration and minimal background autofluorescence. Nanoparticles 
incorporating these IR dyes, such as indocyanine green (ICG) have undergone extensive investigation regarding their 
pharmacokinetic behavior, including biodistribution patterns and clearance mechanisms. These nanoparticles often 
preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues, primarily through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, 
thereby establishing them as potent instruments for sophisticated tumor imaging and precision-targeted drug delivery 
systems. The development of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) for large-scale tissue imaging is attributed to its 
ability to generate highly specific, targeted visualization of organs. The distinctive properties of the near-infrared 
spectrum, including its selective absorption by biomolecules that bind to specific sites within tissues, minimal 
autofluorescence, and reduced light scattering, make it an appealing option for cancer imaging. Unlike the 
conventional structural imaging system, molecular imaging leverages these properties to differentiate between 
malignant and normal tissues at the molecular level, offering a more refined and precise diagnostic capability. This 
review offers a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in Nanoparticle-based NIRF probes 
and multifunctional agents for cancer molecular imaging. These advances will extend the current concepts of cancer 
theranostics by NIRF imaging.

Cancer Molecular Imaging  
Molecular imaging has introduced new possibilities for investigating and noninvasively tracking the formation, 
growth, and spread of tumors in living systems. It is anticipated to offer more detailed anatomical, physiological, and 
functional insights into diseases within clinical environments. Molecular imaging techniques hold significant potential 
as tools for the early detection of cancer, advancing drug discovery and development, and effectively tracking 
responses to treatments. Molecular imaging enables clinicians to identify the precise location of a tumor within the 
body and to observe the expression and activity of particular molecules (such as proteases and protein kinases), as 
well as biological processes (including apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis) that impact tumor behavior and 
treatment response. This knowledge is anticipated to significantly influence cancer detection, personalized treatment 
strategies, drug development, and enhance our comprehension of cancer's origins [1]-[2]. There are several established 
imaging methods, such as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical bioluminescence, and optical fluorescence imaging, which are 
highly effective in capturing images of specific molecular targets associated with tumors [3]. Optical imaging 
techniques are becoming effective high-resolution methods for the early detection of cancer. They offer molecular 
insights into biological tissues and are linked to changes in important physiological parameters. Among the various 
optical imaging techniques, fluorescence imaging is particularly advantageous because it allows for the synchronous 
use of several different molecular probes. This technology operates using probes that emit within the near-infrared 
fluorescence (NIRF) spectrum, between 650 and 900 nm wavelengths. Polymethines, like Cy5.5 and Cy7, are the 
most commonly used organic NIR fluorophores for in-vivo NIRF imaging. Recently, several new NIRF probes 
characterized by improved fluorescence quantum yield, enhanced photostability, reduced aggregation, and lower 
cytotoxicity have been developed, including boron-dipyrromethene derivatives, Nile blue analogs, oxazine dye 
AOI987, and activatable probes. Advancements in NIRF-based in vivo cancer molecular imaging have accelerated 
significantly in recent years due to the creation of novel probes and improvements in optical imaging instruments [4].  
In this review, we outline recent advancements in Nanoparticle-based near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) probes for 
cancer molecular imaging. These nanoparticles, usually less than 200 nm in size, are designed to access nearly any 
part of the body. They can be easily modified with various targeting ligands and loaded with multiple contrast agent 
molecules significantly enhancing signal intensity across different imaging modalities. NIRF imaging utilizing 
nanoparticle-based probes is rapidly becoming a powerful tool in noninvasive cancer detection [5]. NIRF imaging 
offers multiple advantages over other optical imaging techniques for early cancer detection due to its low absorption 
and minimal autofluorescence. It also provides high sensitivity, the ability to detect multiple targets, and poses minimal 
risk to living subjects by using non-ionizing radiation. It is cost-effective, with affordable molecular probe preparation 
and easy-to-use detection equipment [6]. Also, the light signals released from biological tissues provide molecular 
information associated to pathophysiological changes and this technique relies on the use of a fluorescence probe that 
emits within the NIR spectrum [7]. 
There has been significant interest in the use of NIRF probes for both bioimaging and therapeutic applications. Their 
unique optical properties, combined with the ability to penetrate deep tissues and minimize background interference, 
make them highly promising tools for advancing diagnostics and targeted treatments in medical research. A wide 
range of NIRF dyes with excellent photophysical properties have been created. These dyes can be easily conjugated 
with various molecules, including small molecules, nucleotides, double-stranded DNA, DNA primers, amino acids, 
proteins, and antibodies, to achieve targeted specificity [8]. Their ability to be easily modified through conjugation 
with specific moieties makes NIRF dyes ideal for highly specific and sensitive cancer imaging. Nanoparticles 
encapsulating NIRF dyes and anticancer agents are crucial in the synergistic approach to cancer treatment [9].  
Classifications of organic NIRF dyes 
Despite the growing interest in NIRF dyes for bioimaging applications, their practical availability remains limited due 
to inherent challenges such as poor photostability, low hydrophilicity, and difficulties in effectively capturing signals 
within complex, heterogeneous tissues in-vivo. To address these issues, substantial research efforts have been devoted 
to reengineering and optimizing NIRF dyes. A significant focus has been placed on developing novel dyes with 
improved photostability and enhanced fluorescence intensity. Hydrophobic dyes have been chemically modified to 
increase hydrophilicity, thereby reducing self-aggregation and improving their performance in biological 
environments [10]. NIRF dyes are broadly categorized into several distinct groups based on their underlying organic 
fluorophore frameworks, including cyanines, rhodamine derivatives, 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene 
(BODIPYs), squaraines, phthalocyanines, porphyrin analogs, and other structurally related dyes. Each class is defined 
by unique optical and chemical characteristics that enhance their suitability for precise near-infrared imaging across 
diverse biomedical settings [11]-[12]. The chemical structures of the dyes are shown in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1. Basic chemical structure of near infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dyes. 
Cyanine dyes 
Cyanine dyes plays a key role in diagnostics and therapeutic research. Among these, indocyanine green (ICG)—a 
tricarbocyanine dye—was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over five decades ago and 
remains widely used for clinical diagnostics. Structurally, cyanine dyes consist of two nitrogen-bearing heterocyclic 
rings functioning as charged chromophores, bridged by a polymethine chain with an odd number of carbons, which 
contributes to their distinct optical properties. Renowned for their narrow absorption spectra and high extinction 
coefficients, certain cyanine variants, such as Cy5 and Cy7, exhibit fluorescence within the near-infrared (NIR) range. 
This property makes them especially valuable as NIRF dyes, enabling high-intensity fluorescence and optimal tissue 
imaging due to their minimal background interference and strong signal clarity [4]. 
Rhodamine dyes 
Rhodamine dyes, a prominent class within the xanthene dye family, have been extensively leveraged as fluorescent 
probes due to their superior photophysical properties, including high molar extinction coefficients and remarkable 
resistance to photobleaching. However, the conventional forms of these dyes emit fluorescence only within the visible 
light range (500–600 nm), restricting their applicability in in vivo bioimaging, where near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths 
are essential for deeper tissue penetration and reduced background interference. Significantly, the fluorescence 
behavior of rhodamine dyes can be finely tuned via various mechanisms, such as photo-induced electron transfer 
(PET) and reversible ring-opening/closing processes. By strategically modifying the xanthene core, researchers have 
synthesized NIR-emitting rhodamine derivatives. These modifications involve sophisticated molecular strategies, 
including PET modulation, redox reactions, and spirocyclic ring-opening mechanisms, allowing precise control over 
fluorescence intensity and wavelength. These advancements have transformed rhodamine dyes into highly versatile 
tools, expanding their applicability to NIR-based bioimaging and diagnostic platforms, which demand high signal 
clarity, photostability, and molecular specificity [9]. 
BODIPY-based NIRF probes 
BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene) established themselves as valuable tools for bioimaging, largely due to their high 
molar extinction coefficients, outstanding quantum yields, and exceptional thermal and photochemical stability. 
However, traditional BODIPY dyes are constrained by absorption and emission wavelengths that do not extend into 
the near-infrared (NIR) region, limiting their utility for deep tissue imaging where NIR fluorescence is crucial for 
minimizing autofluorescence and enhancing tissue penetration. To address these limitations, researchers have devised 
two principal approaches to transform BODIPY into NIR-active fluorophores. The first involves structural 
modification of the phenyl rings, while the second strategy merges the 3- and 5-phenyl rings with the aza-BODIPY 
core. These fusion forms six-membered rings, effectively reducing the torsional strain between the peripheral phenyl 
rings and the central core. By improving the co-planarity between these structural elements, these modifications 
facilitate a bathochromic shift, likely driven by enhanced electron delocalization across the conjugated system. This 
shift extends the optical activity into the NIR spectrum, enabling superior performance for in vivo bioimaging 
applications and fluorescence-based diagnostics. These advancements have significantly expanded the functional 
scope of BODIPY derivatives, making them indispensable in NIR fluorescence imaging for deep tissue visualization, 
molecular diagnostics, and theranostic platforms that demand stability, sensitivity, and high photonic output [9]. 
Squaraine-based NIRF probes 
Squaraines, dyes, are recognized for their zwitterionic architecture, centered around an oxocyclobutenolate core. This 
core is flanked by aromatic or heterocyclic moieties, forming a donor–acceptor–donor structure, which contributes to 
their distinctive photophysical behavior. These dyes typically emit within the red to near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, 
offering desirable optical properties; however, their large molecular size and hydrophobicity present challenges for 
biological applications. To overcome these limitations, researchers have pursued three advanced strategies to enhance 
the performance of NIRF squaraine dyes, regulating aggregation and disaggregation, Functional Modifications with 
Targeting Moieties and Stimuli-Responsive Formation and Degradation. Recent innovations have further refined 
squaraine-based probes. For instance, bis(vinyl ruthenium)-modified squaraine dyes employ a reversible 
polyelectrochromic switch to modulate NIR absorption bands with precision, enhancing their adaptability in variable 
environments. Additionally, the integration of dicyanovinyl groups into the dye structure has significantly improved 
their NIR fluorescence intensity and chemical resilience, broadening their applicability in demanding biomedical 
settings such as deep tissue imaging and molecular diagnostics [6]. 
Phthalocyanines and porphyrin derivatives 
Phthalocyanines and porphyrin derivatives represent a class of highly adaptable functional pigments, each comprising 
a core of four isoindole or pyrrole units with nitrogen atoms. Phthalocyanines are characterized by a 4n+24n+24n+2 
π-electron system, with the π-electrons extensively delocalized across the chromophore. This delocalization imparts 
exceptional chemical and thermal stability, allowing these compounds to withstand high-energy electromagnetic 
radiation. The two hydrogen atoms in the central cavity can be readily substituted with metal ions or functional groups, 
enabling precise modulation of their physicochemical properties to meet diverse application needs. While these 
pigments are utilized in fields such as electronics, optoelectronics, and biomedical science, their natural emission 
spectra fall short of the NIR range, limiting their utility in near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) applications. To extend 
their emission into the NIR region, strategies such as introducing benzene ligands and incorporating electron-donating 
substituents have been employed. These modifications enhance π-conjugation and shift the emission towards NIR 
wavelengths. Porphyrins and their expanded analogs, which contain four or more pyrrole or heterocyclic rings, offer 
a robust framework for NIRF probe development. Their macrocyclic architecture provides not only excellent 
photophysical characteristics but also outstanding chemical stability, making them ideal candidates for advanced 
applications in molecular imaging, diagnostics, and targeted therapeutics. These structural advantages position 
porphyrin derivatives at the forefront of innovative NIRF probe design, enabling breakthroughs in fields such as 
bioimaging and theranostics [11]. 
Nanoparticle-based NIRF probes  
NIRF nanoprobes are classified in two main categories: the well-established downconversion (DCN) NIRF 
nanoprobes and the newly developed upconversion (UCN) NIRF nanoprobes. DCN nanoprobes produce low-energy 
fluorescence when stimulated by high-energy light. Examples of these include nanoparticles embedded with NIRF 
dyes, quantum dots (QDs), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), and metal nanoclusters. Conversely, UCN 
nanoprobes, a novel class of fluorescent nanoparticles, possess the capability to convert long-wavelength, low-energy 
excitation light into short-wavelength, high-energy fluorescence. A brief overview of the well-established NIRF 
nanoprobes including NIRF dyes containing nanoparticles, NIR fluorescent quantum dots (QDs), and gold 
nanoclusters are described below [13] [9]. 
NIRF dye-containing Nanoprobes  
NIRF dye-containing nanoprobes consist of organic or inorganic matrix-based nanomaterials, where the NIRF dyes 
are either embedded within the matrix (dye-doped) or attached to the surface of the nanoparticles. For optimal 
performance, the matrix must be optically transparent to allow the excitation and emission light to pass through 
effectively [14]. Organic NIRF dyes are usually integrated via non-covalent or covalent bonding, creating functional 
nanoparticles with a core–shell structure. This design enhances photostability, biocompatibility, reduces self-
aggregation, and delivers a bright fluorescence signal, with easily adjustable bioconjugation. 
Gold nanostructures  
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are regarded as the top plasmonic material and have garnered attention in cancer research, 
particularly in cancer theranostics. AuNPs can be engineered into various shapes, including nanospheres, nanorods, 
nanoshells, nanostars, and nanocages, thanks to their exceptional tunability in size and shape as well as their favorable 
physiochemical properties. They have been widely studied for applications in Raman imaging and photoacoustic 
imaging (PAI), primarily because of their outstanding optical properties, high stability, low toxicity, and ease of 
bioconjugation. Fluorescent gold nanoprobes (GNPs), known for their ultra-small size, customizable optical 
properties, and high biocompatibility, serve as effective targeted probes for in vivo optical imaging [15].  
Quantum dots 
Quantum dots (QDs) are inorganic fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals, they are synthesized in organic solvents 
like hexane, and consist of an inorganic core and shell, often metallic, which can be finely tuned to optimize peak 
fluorescence emission. Their use as fluorescent biotags in cell labeling and disease diagnostics stands out as a highly 
promising application in nanomedicine, owing to their distinctive optical properties. These include size-dependent 
photoluminescence, narrow and symmetric emission profiles, broad absorption spectra, and remarkable photostability. 
Such attributes position QDs as highly versatile tools for cutting-edge molecular imaging and diagnostic techniques 
in biomedical research. Quantum dot (QD) fluorescence emission can be precisely tuned to virtually any specific 
wavelength. More significantly, QDs exhibit exceptional resistance to photobleaching and chemical degradation, 
ensuring prolonged fluorescence stability. Additionally, their large surface area enables the conjugation of multiple 
targeting molecules to a single QD, enhancing their versatility in bioimaging applications. Furthermore, in organic 
solvents, QDs demonstrate extremely high quantum yields, making them highly efficient fluorescent probes for 
advanced imaging and diagnostic purposes [16]. 
NIRF Probes designed with advanced targeting capabilities        
A critical challenge in the in vivo administration of NIR imaging agents lies in ensuring precise delivery and/or 
activation within the target tissue. To address this, a range of advanced strategies has been employed to enhance 
targeting specificity or probe activation, often intricately tailored to the molecular characteristics of the target. In the 
context of tumor targeting with NIRF nanoparticles, three principal methodologies have been adopted: (i) exploiting 
the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect; (ii) molecular targeting via selective antigens or overexpressed 
receptors on cancer cell membranes; and (iii) chemical activation of nanoprobes in tumor-specific microenvironments, 
such as through enzymatic cleavage or oxidative processes [17]. Probes with targeting capabilities are pivotal for 
achieving high specificity and sensitivity in bioimaging applications. Integrating targeting moieties into these dyes or 
NIRF dye-loaded nanoparticles is a fundamental aspect of probe development. Presently, frequently employed 
targeting moieties include antibodies, peptides, proteins, aptamers, and small molecule receptor ligands. Remarkably, 
when these targeting elements are precisely integrated, the probes typically retain their intrinsic NIRF optical 
characteristics, along with their pharmacokinetic behavior and in vivo biodistribution [9]. 
NIRF dyes with enhanced tumor-targeting Capability  
Numerous NIRF dyes have inherently demonstrated the capability to selectively accumulate in tumor tissues without 
the need for conjugation with targeting moieties. Notable examples include heptamethine indocyanine dyes such as 
IR-780 iodide, IR-783, MHI-148, and porphyrin derivatives like Pz 247, all of which exhibit preferential tumor 
localization. These properties confer distinct priority over conventional fluorescent agents like ICG. The 
multifunctional nature of these NIRF dyes provides deeper insights into tumor-specific imaging modalities, advancing 
the field of targeted diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring [18]. 
NIRF Nanoparticles with highly specific targeting capabilities 
To achieve specific binding at targeted sites, NIRF dyes require conjugation with biomolecules that facilitate binding 
only in the targeted locations. A wide range of targeting groups have been developed to modify and functionalize 
NIRF nanoprobes, including small molecules, peptides, proteins, aptamers, engineered antibodies, and antibody-based 
ligands. As bioimaging technology advances, targeted NIRF probes are increasingly being used for cell labeling and 
tracking in physiological conditions, as well as for assessing the morphology and function of cancer cells and 
interstitial tissues [19]. These targeted NIRF nanoprobes have the potential to greatly improve delivery efficiency by 
increasing specificity and selectivity of targeting the desired tissue. Meanwhile, a range of molecules and proteins 
implicated in carcinogenesis and the tumor microenvironment have been integrated into the design of NIRF probes to 
confer highly specific targeting properties. [20]. 
Target-responsive NIRF nanoparticles 
Activatable imaging probes enhance signal output in real time by reacting to specific biomolecular interactions or 
environmental changes [21]. Upon reaching the target site, enzyme cleavage triggers the release of fluorophores, 
which emit a strong fluorescent signal. This distinct feature of activatable fluorescence molecular probes offer 
significantly improved signal-to-background ratios and improved specificity for NIRF bioimaging, compared to 
traditional "constantly active" fluorescent probes. They also demonstrate excellent sensitivity and can penetrate deeply 
into tissues in vivo. Nanoparticle-based activatable probes have attracted considerable interest due to their NIRF 
quenching capabilities, which offer substantial advantages for high-precision optical imaging [22]. 
Multimodality imaging   
While fluorescence serves as a robust technique for visualizing molecular targets at both microscopic and macroscopic 
levels, it does not inherently offer anatomical information—unless it is specifically directed towards structural markers 
such as the vasculature or cytoskeleton. Integrating NIR fluorescence imaging with complementary imaging 
modalities (e.g., optical, radionuclide, MRI, and CT) that provide anatomical context significantly enhances the value 
of the molecular data acquired through fluorescence. This multimodal approach facilitates more straightforward data 
interpretation, particularly in macroscopic imaging applications. These multimodal systems offer several unique 
advantages, such as enhancing the ability to quantify and precisely localize biological processes and events, facilitating 
the characterization of new imaging probes, and enabling the generation of near-perfectly aligned images with minimal 
or no motion artifacts. This, in turn, improves the interpretation and quantification of data across a wide range of 
experimental systems [23]. 
Pharmacokinetics 
A thorough understanding of how NIRF nanoprobes enter, distribute within, and exit living organisms is crucial for 
designing nanoprobes optimized for molecular imaging. Various factors affect the probe's ability to reach its target, 
such as its binding affinity, the concentration of the target antigen, the excretion kinetics, the probe’s physical 
dimensions, and the composition of the coating material, especially in nanoparticle-based formulations [17]. To 
achieve optimal accumulation of NIRF nanoprobes at tumor sites, it is essential to circumvent uptake by the 
reticuloendothelial system (RES) and the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). However, a significant challenge 
arises from the rapid clearance of many administered NIRF nanoprobes from the bloodstream, primarily due to RES 
and MPS activity, which leads to their sequestration in the liver and spleen. Consequently, the development of NIRF 
nanoprobes capable of evading swift systemic clearance represents a critical advancement for enhancing their 
functionality and precision as imaging agents. Three fundamental parameters that govern the in vivo behavior of NIRF 
nanoprobes include surface coating, particle size, and surface charge, they serve as key considerations for the strategic 
design of next-generation NIRF nanoprobes for cancer molecular imaging. Modifying the nanoprobe surface with 
hydrophilic polymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG) can improve solubility, reduce nonspecific interactions, extend 
systemic circulation, and improve tumor-specific targeting. However, such surface modifications may also result in a 
substantial increase in the overall nanoparticle size and the physical size of the imaging agent have a profound effect 
on its in vivo distribution [24]-[25]. Majority of NIRF nanoprobes employed for in vivo imaging are relatively large, 
with hydrodynamic diameters (HD) exceeding 20 nm, leading to preferential accumulation in the liver. From a clinical 
perspective, smaller nanoprobes are advantageous, as renal clearance is more efficient, thereby minimizing the risk of 
prolonged bodily retention. For instance, quantum dots with a neutral surface charge and a HD around 5.5 nm can 
undergo rapid renal elimination. However, the reduced size of these nanoprobes often correlates with shorter systemic 
half-lives, which typically compromises tumor accumulation. To optimize efficacy, NIRF nanoprobes should ideally 
be engineered to achieve a delicate balance: they must be small enough to enable efficient retention into tumor sites 
yet possess a sufficiently extended half-life to ensure adequate tumor targeting and retention [17]. 
Toxicity  
Addressing and mitigating the potential in vivo toxicity of nanoprobes is paramount for their eventual transition to 
clinical application. Toxicity may stem either from the NIRF nanoprobes themselves or from degradation byproducts 
released in vivo. To address these challenges, various design strategies have been implemented to design 
biocompatible and biodegradable nanoprobes composed of minimally toxic constituents. For instance, clinically 
approved ICG fluorophores encapsulated within CPNPs exhibit both biocompatibility and biodegradability. Likewise, 
biodegradable NIR silicon nanoparticles have shown no detectable toxicity in preclinical animal models. Additionally, 
dye-loaded water-soluble polymers, designed for both biocompatibility and biodegradability, hold promise for clinical 
applications, offering a refined approach to minimizing toxicity while maintaining functionality in molecular imaging 
[26].  
Advancing Therapeutic Applications of Near-Infrared Fluorophores in Cancer Research 
Drug delivery 
Chemotherapy has been widely applied to maximize the therapeutic outcome in cancer treatment. However, most 
cytotoxic drugs lack the ability of specific accumulation in tumors. In addition, various side effects may occur during 
the course of chemotherapy. These remain major impediments to the treatment of malignancies. Thus, novel platforms 
for targeted drug delivery that are safe and effective in vivo are highly desirable. Effective delivery of chemical drugs 
to tumor sites is particularly appealing for the enhancement of the tumor-killing effect and the reduction of systemic 
toxicities [27]. Studies have revealed that drug-loaded nanoparticle (NP) systems leverage the enhanced permeability 
and retention (EPR) effect to preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues, significantly enhancing drug bioavailability 
and extending therapeutic exposure. Furthermore, polymer conjugates demonstrate rapid absorption and sustained 
retention within the lymphatic system, while maintaining a favorable toxicity profile. At present, antibodies targeting 
specific cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets have been successfully engineered. The strategic conjugation of 
monoclonal antibodies with NIRF dyes has further been employed for precision theranostics, facilitating targeted 
interventions in malignancies such as cutaneous tumors, breast, ovarian, gastric, and prostate cancers. This advanced, 
controlled drug delivery platform offers the potential to address the inherent limitations of conventional chemotherapy, 
particularly by improving tumor specificity and minimizing systemic side effects [3]. 
Photothermal therapy                     
Photothermal therapy (PTT), a noninvasive therapeutic modality, has garnered significant attention for its efficacy in 
treating various diseases, particularly in oncology. This advanced laser-induced thermal treatment, mediated by 
nanoparticles or pharmacological agents, represents one of the most promising strategies for inhibiting tumor growth 
with minimal morbidity and diminished systemic toxicity. The use of laser-absorbing agents or chromophores 
enhances localized thermal damage within the tumor microenvironment, amplifying the precision and effectiveness 
of the therapeutic intervention [28].   
Photo-chemotherapy                          
Photo-chemotherapy utilizes light irradiation that is enhanced by photosensitizers to exert therapeutic effects in cancer 
tissues. When excited by light at a certain wavelength, photosensitizers facilitate the generation of cytotoxic free 
radicals [29]. These products affect tumor growth by destroying the abnormal neovasculature directly. They also 
initiate an inflammatory microenvironment that leads to cancer cell death. The first approved photosensitizer, 
Photofrin, is a composite of oligomeric porphyrins that has been applied for the treatment of lung cancer, esophagus 
cancer, and other types of cancer. The initial development of Photofrin in photo-chemotherapy for the treatment of 
bladder tumors was successful, current applications of Photofrin in photo-chemotherapy face numerous challenges 
that constrain its widespread clinical utility. These include insufficient penetration into deep tissues, poor tumor 
selectivity, and unintended accumulation in non-target areas such as the skin, leading to heightened photosensitivity 
upon exposure to sunlight. Therefore, the development of next-generation photosensitizers that circumvent these 
limitations is critical for the enhanced efficacy and broader application of photo-chemotherapy in oncology [30][31].  
Near-Infrared Photoimmunotherapy  
Near-Infrared Photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is based on cancer-targeted therapy that can selectively monitor and 
destroy cancer tissues. Nakajima et al developed a NIRF probe for PIT by linking a phthalocyanine dye IR700 and a 
monoclonal antibody. When exposed to NIR light, the conjugates that had been accumulated in the target sites induced 
highly specific tumoricidal activities. Selective binding avoided unnecessary injury to normal tissues. It was revealed 
that IR700 eventually accumulated in lysosomes. After exposure to a threshold intensity of NIR light, the conjugates 
immediately disrupted the outer cell membrane and lysosomes. Furthermore, repeated application of NIRF dyes was 
an effective strategy for cancer therapy without severe side effects; complete pathological remission might even be 
achieved [32]. 
 
Conclusion 
Over the past decade, NIRF dyes have garnered substantial attention in biomedical research due to the NIR region's 
optimal optical window for deep tissue imaging. With appropriate modification, these dyes enable rapid cancer 
screening and early detection, serving as invaluable tools in guiding cancer therapies and contributing to reduced 
cancer morbidity and mortality rates. However, conventional dyes are susceptible to photobleaching and often fail to 
achieve adequate target-to-background contrast for clinical applications. Breakthroughs in nanotechnology and 
advanced imaging systems have catalyzed significant progress in probe design and multichannel imaging techniques. 
A wide array of nanoparticles has been engineered and evaluated as promising contrast agents or delivery vehicles for 
molecular imaging. The successful development of receptor-specific NIR nanoprobes, coupled with their applications 
in cancer diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, has ignited substantial interest in personalized medical interventions, 
paving the way for more precise and individualized treatments. Nanoparticles (NPs) provide critical protection to 
NIRF dyes, safeguarding them from degradation while enhancing their fluorescence properties and enabling precise 
targeting with significantly improved signal-to-noise ratios. Despite the impressive outcomes observed in 
experimental research, the clinical translation of NP-based NIRF probes remains a distant prospect. Several substantial 
barriers need to be addressed before reaching the stage of clinical trials, particularly concerning the pharmacokinetic 
behavior and potential toxicity associated with the chemical and metallic materials used, optimal dosing strategies, 
and surface functionalization.
