Abstract
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising class
of targeted cancer therapeutics, but the design and optimization of their
cytotoxic payloads remain challenging. This study introduces Dumpling-
GNN, a novel hybrid Graph Neural Network architecture specifically de-
signed for predicting ADC payload activity based on chemical struc-
ture. By integrating Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN), Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE layers, DumplingGNN ef-
fectively captures multi-scale molecular features and leverages both 2D
topological and 3D structural information. We evaluate DumplingGNN
on a comprehensive ADC payload dataset focusing on DNA Topoiso-
merase I inhibitors, as well as on multiple public benchmarks from Molecu-
leNet. DumplingGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across several
datasets, including BBBP (96.4% ROC-AUC), ToxCast (78.2% ROC-
AUC), and PCBA (88.87% ROC-AUC). On our specialized ADC pay-
load dataset, it demonstrates exceptional accuracy (91.48%), sensitivity
(95.08%), and specificity (97.54%). Ablation studies confirm the syner-
gistic effects of the hybrid architecture and the critical role of 3D struc-
tural information in enhancing predictive accuracy. The model’s strong
interpretability, enabled by attention mechanisms, provides valuable in-
sights into structure-activity relationships. DumplingGNN represents a
significant advancement in molecular property prediction, with particular
promise for accelerating the design and optimization of ADC payloads in
targeted cancer therapy development.

Introduction
1.1
Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) and Payload Im-
portance
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising class of bio-
pharmaceuticals in the field of targeted cancer therapy, offering a paradigm

shift in the treatment of various malignancies [Beck et al., 2017, Tsuchikama
and An, 2018]. ADCs combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the
potency of cytotoxic small molecule drugs, creating a sophisticated therapeutic
modality that aims to deliver highly potent drugs directly to cancer cells while
minimizing systemic toxicity [Peters and Senter, 2018]. This unique approach
leverages the precise targeting capabilities of antibodies to selectively bind to
tumor-associated antigens, followed by internalization and subsequent release of
the cytotoxic payload within the cancer cells [Lambert, 2017].
The efficacy of ADCs is fundamentally dependent on three key components: the
antibody, the linker, and the payload [Beck et al., 2017]. While each component
plays a crucial role, the payload - typically a small molecule drug with potent
cytotoxic activity - is particularly critical in determining the overall therapeutic
efficacy of the ADC [Zhao et al., 2020]. The ideal ADC payload should possess
high potency, suitable physicochemical properties for conjugation and release,
and a mechanism of action effective against the target cancer cells [Beck et al.,
2017, Tsuchikama and An, 2018]. Consequently, the design, selection, and opti-
mization of ADC payloads have become central challenges in ADC development,
directly impacting the success rate of these promising therapeutics [Carter and
Senter, 2018].
The importance of accurately predicting ADC payload activity cannot be over-
stated in the context of ADC development. Traditional approaches to payload
selection and optimization have relied heavily on empirical methods, includ-
ing high-throughput screening and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies
[Beck et al., 2017]. While these methods have led to the development of sev-
eral successful ADCs, they are often time-consuming, resource-intensive, and
limited in their ability to explore vast chemical spaces efficiently [Zhao et al.,
2020]. Moreover, the complex interplay between payload structure, linker chem-
istry, and antibody characteristics in determining ADC efficacy poses significant
challenges to traditional predictive methods [Carter and Senter, 2018].
These limitations have spurred a growing interest in more advanced, computa-
tional approaches to ADC payload activity prediction. In particular, there is
an urgent need for methods that can:
1. Rapidly screen large libraries of potential payload molecules [Beck et al.,
2017]
2. Accurately predict payload activity based on molecular structure [Zhao
et al., 2020]
3. Account for the unique biological context of ADCs, including target inter-
action [Carter and Senter, 2018]
4. Provide interpretable results to guide rational payload design and opti-
mization [Peters and Senter, 2018]
The advent of machine learning, particularly deep learning techniques, has
opened new avenues for addressing these challenges in ADC payload prediction
2
[Schneider et al., 2020]. These data-driven approaches offer the potential to
learn complex structure-activity relationships from large datasets, potentially
uncovering patterns and insights that may be missed by traditional methods
[Yang et al., 2019a]. However, the application of advanced machine learning
techniques to ADC payload prediction is still in its infancy, presenting both
exciting opportunities and significant challenges [Wu et al., 2020a].
1.2
Machine Learning in Molecular Property Prediction
The limitations of traditional methods in ADC payload activity prediction have
led to an increased interest in machine learning (ML) approaches for molecular
property prediction [Schneider et al., 2020]. ML techniques, particularly those
based on deep learning, have shown remarkable success in various domains of
drug discovery and development [Vamathevan et al., 2019]. These data-driven
approaches offer several advantages in the context of molecular property pre-
diction:
• Ability to learn complex, non-linear structure-activity relationships from
large datasets [Yang et al., 2019a]
• Capacity to handle high-dimensional feature spaces characteristic of molec-
ular data [Wu et al., 2018]
• Potential for end-to-end learning, reducing the need for manual feature
engineering [Duvenaud et al., 2015]
• Scalability to screen large virtual libraries of compounds efficiently [G´omez-
Bombarelli et al., 2018]
Early applications of ML in molecular property prediction primarily relied on
traditional algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, and
shallow neural networks [Goh et al., 2017]. These methods typically operate
on hand-crafted molecular descriptors or fingerprints, which, while informa-
tive, may not fully capture the complex structural and chemical properties of
molecules [Wu et al., 2018].
The advent of deep learning has opened new possibilities for more sophisticated
molecular representations and predictive models.
Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been applied to
molecular property prediction tasks with some success, particularly when work-
ing with string-based representations of molecules such as SMILES [Weininger,
1988]. However, these approaches often struggle to fully capture the inherent
graph-like structure of molecules, leading to potential loss of important struc-
tural information [Wu et al., 2020a].

Graph Neural Networks:
Advancements and Chal-
lenges in Molecular Modeling
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
molecular property prediction, offering a natural way to represent and process
molecular structures [Zhou et al., 2020]. GNNs operate directly on molecular
graphs, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds as edges,
allowing for a more faithful representation of molecular structure compared to
traditional methods [Wu et al., 2020a].
The advantages of GNNs in molecular modeling include their ability to directly
process graph-structured data, capture both local and global structural features,
and ensure invariance to graph isomorphisms [Gilmer et al., 2017]. Moreover,
GNNs offer potential for interpretability through analysis of learned node and
edge features [Ying et al., 2019].
However, the application of GNNs to ADC payload activity prediction faces
several challenges. These include data scarcity, difficulties in capturing long-
range dependencies and multi-scale features, limited model interpretability, and
the need for better integration of 3D structural information [Wu et al., 2020b,
Gilmer et al., 2017, Xu et al., 2018, Klicpera and Gross, 2021].
Addressing
these challenges is crucial for developing GNN models that can accurately and
reliably predict ADC payload activity, ultimately accelerating the design and
optimization of more effective ADC therapeutics.
1.4
Introducing DumplingGNN
To address the aforementioned challenges in ADC payload activity prediction,
we propose DumplingGNN, a novel hybrid Graph Neural Network architecture
specifically designed for this task. The name ”DumplingGNN” is inspired by the
Chinese culinary tradition of dumplings, where a thin wrapper envelops a rich,
diverse filling. Similarly, our model encapsulates various molecular features and
learning components within a unified architecture, much like how a dumpling
integrates different ingredients into a cohesive whole.
DumplingGNN incorporates several innovative features that set it apart from
existing GNN models:
• A hybrid architecture that combines Message Passing Neural Networks
(MPNN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE layers to
capture multi-scale molecular features effectively.
• An enhanced molecular graph construction algorithm that incorporates
both 2D topological and 3D structural information, providing a more com-
prehensive representation of ADC payloads.
• A multi-task learning approach that leverages data from various molecular
property prediction tasks to mitigate the data scarcity problem in ADC
payload datasets.
4
• An attention mechanism that enhances model interpretability, allowing for
the identification of key substructures contributing to payload activity.
Just as a dumpling’s wrapper holds together diverse ingredients, Dumpling-
GNN’s hybrid architecture integrates different GNN components to address the
challenges of long-range dependencies and multi-scale feature representation.
The MPNN layers capture local atomic interactions, akin to the individual
flavors in a dumpling’s filling.
The GAT layers focus on identifying impor-
tant substructures, much like how certain ingredients might dominate the taste
profile. Finally, the GraphSAGE layers aggregate information across different
scales, enabling the model to capture both local and global molecular proper-
ties effectively, similar to how the overall flavor of a dumpling emerges from the
combination of its ingredients.
This unique ”dumpling-like” structure allows DumplingGNN to encapsulate a
rich representation of molecular properties within a unified predictive frame-
work, making it particularly well-suited for the complex task of ADC payload
activity prediction.

ROC-AUC), and PCBA (88.87% ROC-AUC), surpassing existing meth-
ods on various molecular property prediction tasks.
4. We conduct extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including our
newly created ADC payload dataset and several public benchmarks from
MoleculeNet. These comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the versatil-
ity and robustness of DumplingGNN across diverse molecular property
prediction tasks.
These contributions collectively advance the field of computational ADC design,
offering new tools and insights for the development of more effective targeted
cancer therapies. The exceptional performance of DumplingGNN, particularly
5
on large-scale and complex datasets, positions it as a promising solution for ad-
dressing the challenges in ADC payload activity prediction and broader molec-
ular property prediction tasks.

Related work
The development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular property
prediction has been an active area of research in recent years [Wu et al., 2020a].
GNNs have shown promise in capturing the complex relationships within molec-
ular graphs, which are essential for tasks such as drug discovery and chemical
compound analysis [Zhou et al., 2020].
2.1
Graph Neural Networks in Drug Discovery
GNNs have been widely applied to the field of drug discovery, particularly for
tasks like molecular property prediction and virtual screening [Wu et al., 2020b].
Researchers have utilized GNNs to predict various properties of molecules, such
as solubility, toxicity, and binding affinity. These models have demonstrated the
ability to learn from the molecular graph structure, which includes information
about atom types, bond types, and the overall topology of the molecule [Zhou
et al., 2020].
Notable works in this area include the development of message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) by Gilmer et al. [Gilmer et al., 2017], which introduced a
general framework for learning on molecular graphs. Kearnes et al. [Kearnes
et al., 2016] proposed graph convolutional networks for molecular fingerprints,
demonstrating their effectiveness in chemical property prediction tasks.
2.2
Hybrid GNN Architectures
The use of hybrid GNN architectures, which combine different GNN modules,
has been explored to improve the performance of molecular property predic-
tion [Wu et al., 2020a]. For instance, the integration of Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs) with Graph Attention Networks (GATs) has been shown to
enhance the model’s ability to distinguish between active and inactive com-
pounds [Velickovic et al., 2017]. This approach leverages the strengths of both
6
architectures, with GCNs providing a robust baseline for learning from local
graph structure and GATs allowing for adaptive feature weighting [Xiong et al.,
2019].
Recent work by Liu et al. [Liu et al., 2021] introduced a hybrid model combin-
ing GCN and LSTM for molecular property prediction, demonstrating improved
performance on several benchmark datasets. Similarly, Rong et al. [Rong et al.,
2020] proposed a self-supervised GNN pre-training strategy that combines struc-
ture and attribute masking, showing significant improvements in downstream
molecular property prediction tasks.
2.3
ADC Payload Activity Prediction
Specifically, in the context of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), there has been
a growing interest in using GNNs to predict the cytotoxic activity of payloads
[Conilh et al., 2023]. Early work in this area focused on traditional machine
learning methods, which relied on handcrafted features extracted from molecular
structures [Liu et al., 2018]. However, recent studies have shown that GNNs can
outperform these traditional methods by directly utilizing the molecular graph
as input, leading to more accurate and interpretable models [Wu et al., 2020a].
Notably, Jiang et al. [Jiang et al., 2021] developed a GNN-based model for
predicting ADC payload activity, incorporating both molecular structure and
physicochemical properties. Their work demonstrated the potential of graph-
based deep learning approaches in this specialized area of drug discovery. Build-
ing on this, Cai et al. [Cai et al., 2023] proposed a multi-task GNN model for
simultaneous prediction of multiple ADC-related properties, including payload
activity and antibody binding affinity.
2.4
Incorporation of 3D Structural Information
While many GNN models for molecular property prediction rely solely on 2D
topological information, there is a growing recognition of the importance of in-
corporating 3D structural data [Sch¨utt et al., 2017]. This is particularly relevant
for tasks involving spatial interactions, such as protein-ligand binding and ADC
payload activity prediction.
Townshend et al. [Townshend et al., 2021] introduced AtomNet, a 3D convolu-
tional neural network for molecular property prediction that directly operates
on atomic coordinates. More recently, Jing et al. [Jing et al., 2023] proposed
an equivariant graph neural network that preserves 3D rotational and transla-
tional invariance, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several molec-
ular property prediction benchmarks.
2.5
Interpretability in Molecular GNNs
As the complexity of GNN models for molecular property prediction increases,
there is a parallel emphasis on developing interpretable models that can provide
7
insights into structure-activity relationships [Pope et al., 2019]. This is cru-
cial for drug discovery applications, where understanding the rationale behind
predictions can guide synthetic efforts and lead optimization.
Ying et al. [Ying et al., 2019] introduced GNNExplainer, a model-agnostic ap-
proach for providing explanations for GNN predictions. In the context of molec-
ular property prediction, this method can highlight substructures or atomic in-
teractions that are most relevant to a particular prediction. Similarly, Schnake
et al. [Schnake et al., 2021] developed a higher-order explanation framework for
GNNs, which can provide more nuanced interpretations of molecular property
predictions.
2.6
Limitations of Existing Approaches
Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the field of molecu-
lar property prediction using GNNs, particularly for complex tasks like ADC
payload activity prediction:
1. Many existing models struggle to effectively integrate 3D structural infor-
mation with 2D topological features [Axelrod and Geiger, 2023].
2. The interpretability of complex hybrid GNN architectures remains limited,
making it challenging to derive actionable insights for drug design [Yuan
et al., 2020].
3. Most models are not specifically tailored for the unique challenges of ADC
payload prediction, which involves complex structure-activity relation-
ships and multiple interacting components [Conilh et al., 2023].
4. There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks and datasets specifically
for ADC payload activity prediction, hindering progress in this important
area of drug discovery [Wu et al., 2018].
Our proposed DumplingGNN model addresses these limitations by introducing a
hybrid architecture that effectively combines 2D and 3D structural information,
incorporates interpretability mechanisms, and is specifically designed for the
challenges of ADC payload activity prediction. Moreover, we introduce a novel
ADC payload dataset that can serve as a valuable benchmark for future research
in this area.

including the construction of a novel ADC payload dataset, the method for
molecular graph construction, the design of the network architecture, and the
training and evaluation strategies.

3.1
Data: A Novel ADC Payload Dataset
Molecules with DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitory capability were collected from
the CHEMBL database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) using the identi-
fier CHEMBL1781. The data profile was thoroughly processed to reduce redun-
dancy and maintain high-quality presentation. To develop a well-performing
classification model, a cutoff value of 100 µM was established, with inhibitory
IC50 values below this threshold labeled as positive and those above labeled as
negative.
The collected molecules possessing inhibitory effects against DNA Topoiso-
merase I, along with their topological information in the form of SMILES
strings, were prepared for 3D conformation analysis. Initial conformer genera-
tion was performed using OpenBabel [Yoshikawa N, 2019] and optimized under
the MMFF94 force field via RDKit [Tosco et al., 2014]. Conformer redundancy
was eliminated using an RMSD cutoff 1.5 ˚A.
To determine the coordinate space of the potential Topoisomerase I inhibitors,
NLDock [Feng et al., 2021] was employed to generate binding conformations in
the ligand binding site of crystallized Topoisomerase I, in complex with DNA
fragments and Camptothecin (PDB database ID: 1t8i [Staker et al., 2005]). The
top three docking poses for each conformer, ranked by estimated binding energy,
were saved for model construction.
In addition to these computationally generated structures, our study introduces
a novel and comprehensive ADC payload dataset, representing a significant ad-
vancement in the field. This innovative dataset uniquely combines 2,292 unique
molecules with their SMILES strings and 2D coordinates, 885 distinct 3D confor-
mations derived from these structures, and 615 additional molecular structures
extracted from recent ADC payload-related patents.
This multifaceted approach yields a first-of-its-kind ADC payload dataset that
synergistically integrates experimental data, high-quality computational pre-
dictions, and state-of-the-art industrial insights. The dataset’s innovation lies
in its comprehensive representation of molecular structures, spanning from 2D
topological to 3D conformational and docked structural information, as well as
its integration of public database entries with proprietary patent-derived struc-
tures.
By incorporating molecules at various stages of the drug discovery pipeline, from
initial screens to patented compounds, this dataset offers unprecedented rele-
vance to real-world applications in ADC payload development. It not only pro-
vides a robust foundation for the development and evaluation of our Dumpling-
GNN model but also represents a valuable resource for the broader ADC re-
search community, potentially accelerating the discovery and optimization of
novel ADC payloads.

3.2
Molecular graph construction
In order to transform ADC payload small molecules into a format suitable for
graph neural network processing, we designed an enhanced molecular graph
construction algorithm [Wu et al., 2020a].
Unlike traditional methods that
only extract atom type information, our algorithm also incorporates chemical
environment information to more comprehensively characterise the molecular
structure [Gilmer et al., 2017].
Specifically, for a given molecule (mol), we extract the following atomic features:
– Atomic number: indicates the type of element
– Degree: the number of bonds attached to the atom
– Number of hydrogen atoms: number of hydrogen atoms attached to the atom
– Implicit valence: the atomic valence level at which all chemical bonds are
considered
– Aromaticity judgement: whether the atom belongs to an aromatic ring or not
– Atomic coordinates: the position of the atom in three-dimensional space
These features reflect the chemical properties of atoms from different perspec-
tives and help the graph neural network to understand the molecular structure
more accurately [Wu et al., 2020b]. In particular, the introduction of atomic
coordinate information enables the model to capture the spatial conformation
of the molecule, which is crucial for the conformational relationship of ADC
payload [Xiong et al., 2019].
While extracting the atomic node features, we also construct the edge index
information, i.e., the existence of an undirected edge between each pair of con-
nected atoms [Zhou et al., 2020]. Eventually, the atom features and edge indexes
are converted into PyTorch tensor and encapsulated into PyTorch Geometric’s
Data object along with the molecule’s activity labels [Wu et al., 2020a]. Com-
pared to traditional molecular graph construction methods that only consider
atom types and chemical bonds, our algorithm incorporates richer chemical in-
formation, enabling downstream graph neural networks to learn more effective
molecular representations from the data, thus improving prediction performance
[Gilmer et al., 2017, Velickovic et al., 2017].
3.3
Network Architecture Design
Based on the molecular graph data constructed above, we designed an innovative
graph neural network model, DumplingGNN, which adopts a hybrid architecture
to leverage the strengths of different GNN modules [Wu et al., 2020a, Zhou et al.,
2020]. This design is motivated by the complex nature of ADC payload activity
prediction, which requires capturing both local chemical interactions and global
molecular properties.

Figure 1: Workflow of DumplingGNN architecture for ADC payload activity

layers to capture multi-scale molecular features.
The structure of the DumplingGNN model consists of an MPNN-GAT*3-
SAGE sequence, integrating multiple powerful GNN components to process the
molecular data effectively [Gilmer et al., 2017, Velickovic et al., 2017, Hamilton
et al., 2017]. This sequential design allows the model to progressively refine and
aggregate molecular information at different scales, mimicking the hierarchical
nature of chemical interactions in biological systems.
3.3.1
Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) Layer
The first layer of DumplingGNN is a Message Passing Neural Network
(MPNN), which aggregates information from neighbouring nodes through a
message-passing mechanism [Gilmer et al., 2017]:
h(k+1)

where h(k)

denotes the features of node i at layer k, N(i) represents the set of
neighbouring nodes of node i, σ is the activation function, and W (k) and M (k)
are learnable weight matrices.

Figure 2: The process of message computation and node update in MPNN. This
mechanism allows for the modeling of local chemical interactions.
The MPNN layer serves as the foundation of our model, capturing local chem-
ical interactions within the molecular graph.
This aligns with the principle
of chemical locality, where an atom’s properties are primarily influenced by
its immediate chemical environment. In the context of ADC payload activity
prediction, this layer can be interpreted as modeling the local reactivity and
functional group interactions that contribute to the payload’s overall activity.
3.3.2
Graph Attention Network (GAT) Layers
Following the MPNN layer, we apply three GAT layers (Graph Attention
Networks) to adaptively assign weights to different neighbours using an attention
mechanism [Velickovic et al., 2017, Vaswani, 2017]. This approach captures key
chemical structure information in the molecular graph:

Figure 3: Graph Attention Network (GAT) in DumplingGNN. The attention
mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant atomic interactions
for activity prediction, enhancing both performance and interpretability.
The integration of Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers within Dumpling-
GNN facilitates the selective emphasis on salient atomic interactions, pivotal for
activity prediction. This approach resonates with the pharmacophore paradigm
in medicinal chemistry, where specific molecular motifs are essential for biolog-
ical efficacy. The attention mechanism serves to discern these critical substruc-
tures and atomic associations that exert the most substantial influence on the
activity of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) payloads.
The sequential deployment of three GAT layers permits the model to progres-
sively discern higher-order and extended molecular interactions. Such complex-
ity is fundamental for ADC payloads, given that molecular conformation and the
topological distribution of functional moieties can markedly affect binding affin-
ity and cellular internalization. Furthermore, this hierarchical attention archi-
tecture enables the dissection of interactions across disparate scales, mirroring
the multifaceted nature of molecular interactions within biological frameworks.
Importantly, the attention mechanism not only bolsters predictive accuracy but
also enhances the biological interpretability of the model. By scrutinizing the
attention coefficients, insights can be gleaned into the atomic interactions and
molecular fragments that the model prioritizes for activity prognostication. This
attribute transforms DumplingGNN from an opaque predictive tool into a more
lucid and interpretable asset in the realm of drug discovery. Visualization of
the attention coefficients as a heatmap superimposed on molecular scaffolds can
delineate the atoms and bonds most influential to predicted activity, offering
medicinal chemists directional cues for lead optimization.
13
The interpretive capabilities conferred by GAT layers herald promising avenues
for future inquiry. The attention signatures garnered by DumplingGNN could
inform automated molecular engineering initiatives, concentrating on the re-
finement of activity-critical substructures. Comparative analysis of attention
signatures across diverse ADC payload classes may elucidate common archi-
tectural elements underpinning their operational mechanisms. Moreover, these
patterns could be exportable to analogous drug discovery endeavors, potentially
amplifying predictive precision and interpretability in related spheres. Subse-
quent studies might also link the attention signatures with characterized binding
sites or interaction nodal points from crystallographic data, further integrating
predictive analytics with structural biology.
In essence, the GAT layers in DumplingGNN amplify predictive proficiency
while also demystifying the model’s inferential processes. This interpretability
is indispensable for instilling confidence in the model’s forecasts and for distill-
ing tangible directives for ADC payload engineering and optimization. As we
persist in honing and interpreting these attention mechanisms, we anticipate
unearthing more profound comprehension of the structure-activity dynamics of
ADC payloads, thereby streamlining the trajectory toward more efficacious and
directed drug discovery endeavors.
3.3.3
GraphSAGE Layer
The final layer of our architecture is a GraphSAGE layer, which effectively
aggregates node information from different domains to learn multi-scale rep-
resentations of molecules through sampling and aggregation [Hamilton et al.,
2017]:
h(k+1)
i

Figure 4: GraphSAGE layer in DumplingGNN. This layer aggregates informa-
tion across different scales, capturing global molecular properties.
The GraphSAGE layer serves to capture global molecular properties by ag-
gregating information across different scales. In the context of ADC payload
prediction, this can be interpreted as modeling the overall molecular properties
that influence activity, such as lipophilicity, molecular weight, and topological
features. These global properties are crucial for predicting how the payload will
behave in a biological system, including its ability to penetrate cell membranes
and interact with the target.
3.3.4
Synergistic Effects and Biological Interpretability
The sequential combination of MPNN, GAT, and GraphSAGE layers in Dumpling-
GNN allows for a hierarchical and comprehensive analysis of molecular structure
and properties:
• The MPNN layer captures local chemical interactions, modeling the reac-
tivity and functional group behavior of the ADC payload.
• The GAT layers identify key substructures and atomic relationships, mim-
icking the concept of pharmacophores in drug discovery.
• The GraphSAGE layer aggregates information to model global molecu-
lar properties, which are crucial for predicting the payload’s behavior in
biological systems.
This multi-scale approach aligns well with the complex nature of ADC payload
activity, which depends on both local chemical reactivity and global molecular
properties. The model’s ability to capture these different levels of molecular
15
information enables it to make more accurate and biologically relevant predic-
tions.
To obtain the final activity prediction for each molecule, we apply global aver-
age pooling followed by a linear layer. This approach, commonly used in graph
neural networks for molecular property prediction [Gilmer et al., 2017, Xu et al.,
2018], allows our hybrid architecture to effectively aggregate node-level informa-
tion into a graph-level representation. Consequently, DumplingGNN captures
both local and global structural information, enhancing its ability to predict
ADC payload activity accurately.
The interpretability of DumplingGNN is further enhanced by the attention
mechanisms in the GAT layers, which can highlight the atomic interactions
most crucial for activity prediction. This feature not only improves prediction
accuracy but also provides valuable insights for medicinal chemists in the design
and optimization of ADC payloads.

Experiments
To thoroughly evaluate the performance of our proposed DumplingGNN model,
we conducted extensive experiments on multiple public datasets and compared
our results with state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we performed ablation
studies to understand the contribution of each component in our model.
4.1

We evaluated DumplingGNN on eight widely-used public datasets from Molecu-
leNet [Wu et al., 2018], covering a diverse range of molecular property prediction
tasks. Table 1 provides an overview of these datasets.

Experimental Setup
DumplingGNN was implemented using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric frame-
works, emphasizing both performance and computational efficiency. Our exper-
16
imental protocol was designed to ensure robust evaluation while maximizing re-
source utilization. For datasets without predefined splits, we employed an 8:1:1
ratio for training, validation, and test sets, respectively. When a predefined test
set was available, we adhered to an 8:2 split for training and validation.
Model optimization was achieved using the AdamW algorithm [Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2019], which combines adaptive learning rates with decoupled weight
decay regularization. The initial learning rate was set to 1e-4, and training was
conducted for a maximum of 1000 epochs. To prevent overfitting and enhance
efficiency, we implemented an early stopping mechanism based on validation set
performance, with a patience of 50 epochs.
Notably, all experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX
4090 GPU, showcasing the model’s impressive efficiency and accessibility. This
hardware choice underscores DumplingGNN’s ability to achieve state-of-the-art
performance without the need for extensive computational resources, making it
a practical solution for a wide range of research environments.
To optimize training time and memory usage, we employed dynamic batch siz-
ing, adjusting the batch size based on the dataset’s characteristics and avail-
able GPU memory.
This approach allowed us to maximize GPU utilization
while maintaining training stability across diverse datasets.
Importantly, no
special parallel processing techniques were employed, highlighting the inherent
efficiency of our model architecture.
The training time varied significantly depending on the dataset size and com-
plexity. For smaller datasets like BBBP (2,039 molecules, 1 task), the training
process completed in approximately 30 minutes.
In contrast, for the largest
dataset, PCBA (437,929 molecules, 128 tasks), the training extended to about
5 days. This wide range of training times demonstrates DumplingGNN’s scala-
bility across datasets of varying sizes and complexities.
Performance metrics, including ROC-AUC, accuracy, and F1 score, were com-
puted and averaged across multiple runs to account for statistical variability.
Standard deviations were reported to provide a measure of the model’s stability
across different data splits and initializations.
This experimental setup demonstrates DumplingGNN’s ability to balance high
performance with computational efficiency, even when processing extremely
large datasets without specialized parallel computing techniques. The model’s
capacity to handle a wide range of dataset sizes on a single GPU makes it
an attractive option for both academic research and industrial applications in
drug discovery and molecular property prediction, particularly in settings where
computational resources may be limited.

Results and Comparison with State-of-the-Art Mod-
els
To rigorously evaluate the performance of DumplingGNN, we conducted a com-
prehensive comparison with a diverse array of state-of-the-art models in molec-
ular property prediction.
These models represent a broad spectrum of ap-
proaches, ranging from traditional graph neural networks to more advanced
architectures incorporating pre-training and multi-task learning strategies. The
comparative models include:
• Traditional GNN models: D-MPNN [Yang et al., 2019b] and Attentive FP
[Xiong et al., 2019]
• Feature engineering approaches: N-Gram models [Liu et al., 1992]
• Pre-training strategies: PretrainGNN [Hu et al., 2021], GROVER [Rong
et al., 2020], GraphMVP [Wang et al., 2021a], and MolCLR [Wang et al.,
2021b]
• Advanced architectures: GEM [Fang et al., 2021], Uni-Mol [Zhou et al.,
2023], MolXPT [Liu et al., 2022], and ChemBFN [Zhang et al., 2022]
• Novel graph construction methods: GraphConv with dummy super node
[Ishiguro et al., 2019]
Table 2 presents a comprehensive performance comparison across eight diverse
datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark [Wu et al., 2018]. The performance
metric used is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-
AUC), a standard measure in binary classification tasks that is particularly suit-
able for potentially imbalanced molecular datasets. It’s important to note that
the comparative data for these models were sourced from the Papers with Code
leaderboards (https://paperswithcode.com/), which aggregate and standard-
ize results from various published works, ensuring a fair and up-to-date com-
parison.

As shown in Table 2, DumplingGNN demonstrates exceptional performance
18
across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on BBBP, ToxCast,
and PCBA datasets.
Notably, our model outperforms existing methods on
datasets with a large number of tasks, showcasing its capability to handle com-
plex multi-task learning scenarios effectively.
It is important to highlight that, due to data limitations, we were only able to
apply 3D structural information to the BBBP dataset. For all other datasets,
DumplingGNN utilized solely SMILES input. This constraint further under-
scores the model’s remarkable potential and versatility, as it achieves competi-
tive or superior performance even without the benefit of 3D structural informa-
tion for most datasets.
On the BBBP dataset, where 3D information was incorporated, DumplingGNN
achieves a remarkable ROC-AUC score of 96.4%, surpassing the previous state-
of-the-art by a significant margin. This result underscores our model’s profi-
ciency in predicting blood-brain barrier penetration, a crucial factor in drug
development for central nervous system disorders.
For the ToxCast dataset, which encompasses 617 different toxicity-related tasks,
DumplingGNN sets a new benchmark with a ROC-AUC score of 78.2%, using
only SMILES input. This performance highlights the model’s ability to capture
intricate patterns across a wide range of toxicity endpoints, demonstrating its
potential for comprehensive toxicity screening in drug discovery pipelines.
Most remarkably, DumplingGNN achieves a breakthrough performance on the
PCBA dataset, attaining a ROC-AUC score of 88.87%, again using only 2D
molecular representations. This result not only surpasses the previous state-of-
the-art (88.5%) but also sets a new standard for performance on this extensive
dataset of 128 bioassays. The PCBA dataset is known for its complexity and
diversity, covering a wide range of biological activities. DumplingGNN’s supe-
rior performance on this dataset showcases its exceptional ability to learn and
generalize across varied molecular property prediction tasks, even without 3D
structural information.
While DumplingGNN does not achieve the highest scores on all datasets, it
consistently performs competitively. For instance, on the BACE dataset, our
model achieves a score of 88.2%, which is very close to the state-of-the-art
performance of 88.4%. Similarly, on the ClinTox dataset, DumplingGNN’s per-
formance (95.9%) is comparable to the best-performing models.
It’s worth noting that DumplingGNN’s performance is particularly strong across
diverse datasets, ranging from smaller specialized sets to larger, more complex
ones. This aligns with our goal of developing a model capable of handling a
wide spectrum of molecular property prediction tasks. The model’s consistent
performance is especially noteworthy when compared to other state-of-the-art
models, including those leveraging external data or employing less interpretable
architectures.
For instance, on the BBBP dataset, DumplingGNN (96.4%) significantly out-
19
performs GROVERlarge (69.5%) [Rong et al., 2020], a large-scale pre-trained
model, and ChemBFN (95.74%) [Zhang et al., 2022], a blackbox neural net-
work approach. On the larger and more complex ToxCast dataset, Dumpling-
GNN (78.2%) surpasses Uni-Mol (69.6%) [Zhou et al., 2023], a unified model for
molecules pre-trained on over 17 million data points. For the extensive PCBA
dataset, DumplingGNN (88.87%) sets a new state-of-the-art, improving upon
Uni-Mol (88.5%) and GEM (86.6%) [Fang et al., 2021], both of which utilize
sophisticated pre-training strategies.
This consistent performance across various datasets, especially considering the
limited use of 3D information (only for BBBP), demonstrates the robustness and
versatility of our approach. DumplingGNN achieves these results while main-
taining interpretability, a crucial factor in drug discovery applications. More-
over, our model’s strong performance using primarily SMILES input suggests
that the incorporation of 3D structural data for other datasets could potentially
lead to even more significant performance improvements.
These results collectively position DumplingGNN as a promising tool for a wide
range of applications in drug discovery and molecular design, offering a balance
of high performance, interpretability, and versatility that sets it apart from
existing approaches.

The results demonstrate that DumplingGNN achieves exceptional performance
on the ADC payload dataset, significantly outperforming other baseline mod-
els across all metrics. This superior performance can be attributed to several
factors:
1. Accuracy and Balanced Performance: DumplingGNN achieves an
outstanding accuracy of 91.48%, with a balanced accuracy of 91.11%. This
indicates that the model performs consistently well across both positive
and negative classes, which is crucial for reliable ADC payload activity
prediction.
20
2. High Sensitivity and Specificity: With a sensitivity of 95.08% and
specificity of 97.54%, DumplingGNN demonstrates an excellent ability to
correctly identify both active (IC50 ¡ 100 µM) and inactive compounds.
This balance is particularly important in drug discovery, where minimizing
both false positives and false negatives is critical.
3. Robust Classification Performance: The Matthews Correlation Co-
efficient (MCC) of 0.8287 indicates a strong correlation between the pre-
dicted and observed classifications, further confirming the model’s robust
performance.
4. Excellent Predictive Power: The high AUC-ROC (0.9547) and AUC-
PR (0.9531) scores demonstrate DumplingGNN’s superior discriminative
ability and precision-recall performance, which are crucial for ranking po-
tential ADC payloads in large-scale virtual screening campaigns.
5. Effective Use of 3D Information: The incorporation of 3D confor-
mational data, generated through docking simulations with the Topoiso-
merase I binding site, likely contributes significantly to DumplingGNN’s
performance. This approach allows the model to capture spatial interac-
tions that are critical for inhibitor binding and activity.
Comparing DumplingGNN to other baseline models reveals its significant ad-
vantages:
• DumplingGNN outperforms the next best model (FiveLayerMPNN) by
4.93 percentage points in accuracy and 5.86 percentage points in MCC,
indicating a substantial improvement in overall predictive power.
• The model shows particular strength in specificity, outperforming Five-
LayerMPNN by 18.33 percentage points. This suggests that Dumpling-
GNN is especially adept at correctly identifying inactive compounds, which
is crucial for reducing false positives in virtual screening.
• The superior performance across all metrics, including F1 Score and bal-
anced accuracy, demonstrates that DumplingGNN provides a more com-
prehensive and reliable prediction of ADC payload activity compared to
single-architecture GNN models.
These results highlight the effectiveness of DumplingGNN’s hybrid architecture
in capturing the complex structural and chemical features that determine DNA
Topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. By leveraging both 2D topological infor-
mation from SMILES strings and 3D conformational data from docking simula-
tions, DumplingGNN can effectively model the intricate relationships between
molecular structure and biological activity.
The model’s strong performance on this dataset suggests its potential utility
in the design and optimization of ADC payloads, particularly those targeting
DNA Topoisomerase I. This could significantly accelerate the discovery of novel,
21
potent ADC payloads, potentially leading to more effective and targeted cancer
therapies.
Furthermore, the superior performance of DumplingGNN over single-architecture
GNNs (MPNN, GAT, SAGE, GCN) underscores the benefits of our hybrid ap-
proach. By combining the strengths of different GNN architectures, Dumpling-
GNN can capture a wider range of molecular features and interactions, leading
to more accurate and reliable predictions.

Ablation Studies
To validate the theoretical principles underlying DumplingGNN’s architecture
and elucidate the contribution of each component, we conducted a series of
rigorous ablation studies. These experiments systematically removed or modi-
fied key components of our model, allowing us to quantify their individual and
combined impacts on prediction performance. This approach not only demon-
strates the empirical effectiveness of our hybrid architecture but also provides
insights into how each component aligns with our theoretical motivations. Table
4 presents the results of these experiments on the ADC payload dataset.

Our ablation studies reveal several critical insights that validate the theoretical
principles guiding DumplingGNN’s architecture:
4.5.1
Significance of 3D Structural Information
The most striking observation is the substantial performance degradation when
the model is restricted to SMILES input (SMILES-Only variant). This variant,
which excludes 3D conformational data, shows a dramatic decrease in accuracy
(from 0.915 to 0.734) and MCC (from 0.829 to 0.461). The AUC-ROC also
drops significantly from 0.955 to 0.782. These results empirically validate our
theoretical motivation for incorporating 3D structural information, as discussed
in Section 3.1. The spatial arrangement of atoms, captured by the 3D confor-
mations generated through docking simulations, proves to be instrumental in
modeling the complex interactions between potential inhibitors and the DNA
Topoisomerase I binding site.
4.5.2
Hierarchical Architecture Analysis
The removal of individual GNN components (GraphSAGE, GAT, or MPNN)
each led to performance decreases, validating our theoretical framework of a
multi-scale approach to molecular representation:
22
MPNN Layer
The No MPNN variant showed a substantial performance
degradation, with accuracy falling to 0.812 and MCC to 0.619. This empirically
confirms the importance of MPNN’s message-passing mechanism in effectively
propagating and aggregating atomic and bond information across the molecular
graph, as theorized in Section 3.3.1.
GAT Layers
Removing the Graph Attention layers (No GAT variant) led
to a similar level of performance decline, with accuracy at 0.803 and MCC at
0.601. This result validates our theoretical motivation for incorporating atten-
tion mechanisms, as outlined in Section 3.3.2.
The substantial performance
drop highlights the significance of GAT in weighing the importance of different
molecular substructures for activity prediction.
GraphSAGE Layer
The exclusion of GraphSAGE layers (No GraphSAGE
variant) resulted in a moderate performance drop, with accuracy decreasing
from 0.915 to 0.870 and MCC from 0.829 to 0.737. This finding supports our
theoretical framework presented in Section 3.3.3, where GraphSAGE was hy-
pothesized to capture global molecular properties. The moderate impact sug-
gests that while GraphSAGE plays an important role in aggregating information
across different scales, some of its functionality may be partially compensated
by the remaining architectures.
4.5.3
Synergistic Effects of Hybrid Architecture
The full DumplingGNN model consistently outperforms all ablated variants
across every metric. This comprehensive superiority empirically validates our
theoretical motivation for adopting a hybrid architecture, as discussed in Section
3.3. The results demonstrate that the combination of different GNN architec-
tures is not merely additive but synergistic, aligning with our hypothesis that
each component captures distinct, complementary aspects of molecular struc-
ture and activity.
4.5.4
Balanced Performance Across Metrics
The full DumplingGNN maintains high performance across all metrics, including
sensitivity (0.951) and specificity (0.975). This balanced performance empiri-
cally supports our theoretical framework of multi-scale molecular representation,
where local chemical interactions, key substructures, and global molecular prop-
erties are all considered. The high sensitivity and specificity demonstrate the
model’s ability to accurately identify both active and inactive compounds, cru-
cial for ADC payload prediction where both false positives and false negatives
have significant implications for drug development.
In conclusion, these ablation studies provide compelling evidence that validates
the theoretical principles guiding DumplingGNN’s architecture. The results em-
pirically confirm the efficacy of our hybrid approach and the importance of 3D
23
structural information in ADC payload activity prediction. Each component
of the model contributes uniquely to its overall performance, with the integra-
tion of 3D conformational data being particularly crucial. This comprehensive
approach enables DumplingGNN to capture a wide range of molecular features
and interactions, leading to superior predictive performance in the challenging
task of ADC payload activity prediction.

Discussion
5.1
Performance Analysis
DumplingGNN demonstrated exceptional performance across a diverse range of
molecular property prediction tasks, particularly excelling in complex, multi-
task scenarios. On the BBBP dataset, our model achieved a remarkable ROC-
AUC score of 96.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by a significant
margin. This result underscores DumplingGNN’s proficiency in predicting blood-
brain barrier penetration, a crucial factor in drug development for central ner-
vous system disorders.
For large-scale, multi-task datasets such as ToxCast (617 tasks) and PCBA (128
tasks), DumplingGNN set new benchmarks with ROC-AUC scores of 78.2%
and 88.87%, respectively. These results highlight the model’s ability to capture
intricate patterns across a wide range of molecular properties, demonstrating
its potential for comprehensive screening in drug discovery pipelines.
On our specialized ADC payload dataset, which focuses on DNA Topoisomerase
I inhibitors, DumplingGNN significantly outperformed other baseline models
across all metrics.
With an accuracy of 91.48%, sensitivity of 95.08%, and
specificity of 97.54%, our model showed a balanced and robust performance in
identifying both active and inactive compounds. The high Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (0.8287) further confirms the model’s strong predictive power for
ADC payload activity.
While DumplingGNN did not achieve the highest scores on all datasets (e.g.,
SIDER and HIV), it consistently performed competitively, showcasing its ver-
satility across various molecular property prediction tasks. This consistent per-
formance, especially on datasets where only SMILES input was available, high-
lights the model’s robustness and potential for even greater improvement with
the incorporation of 3D structural information.

Implications for Drug Discovery
The superior performance of DumplingGNN, particularly on the ADC payload
dataset, has significant implications for drug discovery processes. By accurately
predicting the activity of potential ADC payloads, our model can substantially
accelerate the design and optimization of these complex therapeutics.
This
24
capability is especially valuable given the growing interest in ADCs as targeted
cancer therapies.
DumplingGNN’s exceptional performance in molecular activity prediction and
toxicity assessment aligns perfectly with the critical needs of ADC payload de-
velopment. The model’s ability to accurately distinguish between active and
inactive compounds, as evidenced by its high sensitivity (95.08%) and speci-
ficity (97.54%) on the ADC payload dataset, can significantly streamline the
early stages of drug discovery. This precision is crucial in identifying promising
candidates while minimizing the risk of advancing potentially toxic or ineffective
compounds.
Moreover, the hybrid architecture of DumplingGNN offers strong interpretabil-
ity, a feature often lacking in traditional black-box models. By leveraging at-
tention mechanisms through its GAT layers, the model can highlight which
molecular substructures contribute most significantly to a compound’s predicted
activity or toxicity. This interpretability not only enhances our understanding of
structure-activity relationships but also provides valuable insights for medicinal
chemists in their design and optimization efforts.
The model’s strong generalization capability, demonstrated by its consistent
performance across diverse datasets (BBBP, ToxCast, PCBA), suggests its po-
tential applicability beyond ADC payloads to a wide range of drug discovery
tasks. This versatility is particularly valuable in the pharmaceutical industry,
where a single robust model capable of addressing multiple prediction tasks can
significantly enhance efficiency and reduce development costs.
In large-scale virtual screening campaigns, DumplingGNN’s high AUC-ROC
(0.9547) and AUC-PR (0.9531) scores on the ADC payload dataset indicate its
excellent ability to rank compounds effectively. This could significantly reduce
the number of false positives and negatives, potentially saving considerable time
and resources in the drug discovery pipeline. The model’s capacity to handle
large, multi-task datasets like ToxCast (617 tasks) and PCBA (128 tasks) fur-
ther underscores its potential for comprehensive compound profiling, enabling
simultaneous prediction of multiple molecular properties crucial for drug devel-
opment.
Furthermore, DumplingGNN’s incorporation of 3D structural information, where
available, represents a significant advancement in capturing the spatial aspects
of molecular interactions. This feature is particularly relevant for predicting
binding affinities and understanding how molecules might interact with their
biological targets, offering a more comprehensive approach to in silico drug
screening.
5.3
Limitations and Future Directions
Despite DumplingGNN’s strong overall performance, there are several limita-
tions and areas for future improvement. A key limitation of our current study
25
is the inconsistent use of 3D structural information across datasets. While the
BBBP dataset and our ADC payload dataset leveraged full 3D conformational
data, other public datasets were limited to SMILES representations due to data
availability constraints. This discrepancy may partially explain the variation
in performance across different datasets and highlights the potential for further
improvement by incorporating 3D information consistently.
Future work should focus on extending the use of 3D structural information
to other datasets, which could potentially enhance the model’s performance on
tasks where it currently shows room for improvement (e.g., SIDER and HIV
datasets). This would require extensive computational resources for generat-
ing and optimizing 3D conformations but could lead to significant performance
gains.
Additionally, there is potential for incorporating more domain-specific knowl-
edge into the model. For instance, integrating information about protein tar-
gets, cellular pathways, or known structure-activity relationships could further
enhance the model’s predictive power and interpretability. This could be par-
ticularly beneficial for ADC payload prediction, where understanding the inter-
action between the payload and the target protein is crucial.
Architecturally, while our current hybrid model shows strong performance, there
may be room for further optimization. Exploring additional GNN variants or
developing novel architectures tailored specifically for molecular property pre-
diction could yield even better results. For example, investigating the potential
of more advanced attention mechanisms or incorporating recent advancements
in transformer-based models for graph-structured data could be promising di-
rections.
Lastly, as our model shows particular strength in multi-task learning scenarios,
future research could explore its application to an even broader range of molecu-
lar property prediction tasks. This could include predicting ADMET properties,
protein-ligand interactions, or even extending to related fields such as materials
science. The model’s ability to handle complex, multi-task learning problems
makes it well-suited for these challenging applications.
In conclusion, while DumplingGNN represents a significant advancement in
molecular property prediction, particularly for ADC payloads, there remain ex-
citing opportunities for further refinement and expansion of its capabilities. The
model’s strong performance, even with limited 3D structural information, sug-
gests that future improvements in this area could lead to even more impressive
results.

Conclusion
This study introduces DumplingGNN, a novel hybrid Graph Neural Network
model that represents a significant advancement in the field of molecular prop-
26
erty prediction, with particular emphasis on predicting the cytotoxic activity
of Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) payloads. Through a comprehensive eval-
uation across multiple datasets, including a specialized ADC payload dataset
focusing on DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitors and several public benchmarks, we
have demonstrated the model’s exceptional performance and versatility.
DumplingGNN’s innovative architecture, which synergistically combines Mes-
sage Passing Neural Networks (MPNN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and GraphSAGE, enables it to capture complex molecular features and inter-
actions with unprecedented accuracy. This hybrid approach, coupled with the
integration of 3D structural information where available, has led to state-of-the-
art performance across a diverse range of molecular property prediction tasks.
Notably, on the specialized ADC payload dataset, DumplingGNN achieved an
accuracy of 91.48%, with high sensitivity (95.08%) and specificity (97.54%),
significantly outperforming existing baseline models.
The model’s exceptional performance extends beyond ADC payloads, as evi-
denced by its state-of-the-art results on public datasets such as BBBP (96.4%

These results not only showcase DumplingGNN’s versatility but also its robust-
ness in handling diverse molecular property prediction tasks, including complex
multi-task learning scenarios involving hundreds of endpoints.
A key innovation of DumplingGNN lies in its effective utilization of 3D structural
information, which has proven critical in enhancing predictive accuracy, partic-
ularly for tasks involving spatial molecular interactions. The model’s strong
performance on datasets where only SMILES input was available further high-
lights its potential for even greater improvements with consistent incorporation
of 3D structural data.
Furthermore, the model’s integration of attention mechanisms provides strong
interpretability, offering valuable insights into structure-activity relationships
– a feature of paramount importance in drug discovery and optimization pro-
cesses. This interpretability, combined with the model’s high accuracy, positions
DumplingGNN as a powerful tool for guiding medicinal chemistry efforts in ADC
payload design and optimization.
The development of DumplingGNN represents a significant step forward in the
application of artificial intelligence to drug discovery, with potential impacts
extending far beyond ADC payload design. Its ability to simultaneously pre-
dict multiple molecular properties with high accuracy positions it as a valuable
tool in the complex, multi-parameter optimization processes typical of modern
drug development. This could substantially accelerate the drug discovery pro-
cess, reduce development costs, and increase the success rate of bringing new
therapeutics to market.
Looking ahead, the potential of DumplingGNN opens up several exciting av-
enues for future research and development. These include:
27

discovery continues to evolve, models like DumplingGNN are poised to play
an increasingly critical role in shaping the future of pharmaceutical research
and development. By bridging the gap between computational prediction and
experimental validation, DumplingGNN contributes to the ongoing transforma-
tion of drug discovery into a more efficient, cost-effective, and ultimately more
successful endeavor in improving human health.
