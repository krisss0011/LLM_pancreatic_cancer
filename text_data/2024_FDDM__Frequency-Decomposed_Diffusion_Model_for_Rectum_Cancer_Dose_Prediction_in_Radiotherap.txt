Abstract—Accurate dose distribution prediction is 
crucial in the radiotherapy planning. Although previous 
methods based on convolutional neural network have 
shown promising performance, they have the problem of 
over-smoothing, leading to prediction without important 
high-frequency details. Recently, diffusion model has 
achieved great success in computer vision, which excels in 
generating images with more high-frequency details, yet 
suffers from time-consuming and extensive computational 
resource consumption. To alleviate these problems, we 
propose Frequency-Decomposed Diffusion Model (FDDM) 
that refines the high-frequency subbands of the dose map. 
To be specific, we design a Coarse Dose Prediction Module 
(CDPM) to first predict a coarse dose map and then utilize 
discrete wavelet transform to decompose the coarse dose 
map into a low-frequency subband and three high-
frequency subbands. There is a notable difference between 
the coarse predicted results and ground truth in high-
frequency subbands. Therefore, we design a diffusion-based 
module 
called 
High-Frequency 
Refinement 
Module 
(HFRM) that performs diffusion operation in the high-
frequency components of the dose map instead of the 
original dose map. Extensive experiments on an in-house 
dataset verify the effectiveness of our approach.

plays a pivotal role in improving patients' survival rates and 
their quality of life. Radiotherapy Planning (RP) is an important 
process, aiming to ensure adequate therapeutic dosage to the 
planning target volume (PTV) while minimizing potential harm 
to the organs at risk (OARs). To obtain a clinically acceptable 
RP, dosimetrists need to manually adjust the optimization 
objectives in a trial-and-error manner. This process is time-
consuming and labor-intensive [1]. Besides, the quality of the 
dose map heavily relies on dosimetrists’ expertise and 
experience [2]. Therefore, it is important to develop methods 
that automatically predict dose distribution maps for patients. 
 Recently, due to the rapid development of deep learning (DL), 
especially the convolutional neural network (CNN), many 
CNN-based dose prediction methods have been proposed [3-8]. 
Kearney et al. [3] proposed a 3D UNet-based model called 
DoseNet to predict the dose distribution map. Nguyen et al. [4] 
employed a modified 2D UNet [9] for dose prediction in 
prostate cancer patients. Wang et al. [5] added a progressive 
refinement module in the UNet (PRUNet) to produce more 
accurate dose distributions. 
 Song et al. [6] utilized the deepLabV3+ [10] to extract 
contextual information from different scales, improving the 
accuracy of dose distribution prediction for patients with 
rectum cancer. Wang et al. [7] disassembled the dose 
distribution into many beam paths to transform the task into 
several easy tasks. Furthermore, following the idea of 
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Zhan et al. [8] 
introduced a dual attention module to predict a more precise 
dose map (Mc-GAN).  
 Although these CNN-based methods have achieved 
promising performance, they often suffer from the over-
smoothing problem [11], leading to predictions without 
essential high-frequency details. We display some predicted 
dose maps from five different DL models in Fig. 1, from Fig. 1, 
we can see predictions from (1) to (3) lack high-frequency 
information. These high-frequency details reflect information

on the direction of radiation passing through the human body, 
which is crucial for protecting OARs and killing as many cancer 
cells as possible. In recent years, denoising diffusion 
probabilistic model (DDPM) [14] has achieved good 
performance in various computer vision tasks, Feng et al. [13] 
introduced a structure encoder into the DDPM (DiffDP) to 
better guide the DDPM to generate the dose map. In Fig. 1, we 
find that DDPM is good at generating high-frequency details 
[15], but it requires long running times and substantial 
computational resources to achieve iterative denoising [16]. 
 In this paper, to tackle the problem, we propose the 
Frequency-decomposed Diffusion Model (FDDM) that 
leverages the strength of diffusion models for high-frequency 
details to obtain an accurate dose map and improve the 
efficiency of diffusion models. Specifically, we first gain a 
coarse dose map by our proposed Coarse Dose Prediction 
Module (CDPM). Then, we decompose the coarse dose map 
into four subbands with three high-frequency subbands and a 
low-frequency subband by discrete wavelet transform (DWT), 
which significantly reduces the spatial dimension without 
compromising information [17]. Accordingly, we propose a 
High-Frequency Refinement Module (HFRM) that performs 
diffusion operation in high-frequency subbands rather than the 
original dose map, resulting in a faster speed compared to the 
previous diffusion-based method, DDPM. Furthermore, to 
better guide HFRM to generate the high-frequency components 
of the dose map, we condition HFRM at both the image level 
and feature level. Finally, we use inverse wavelet transform 
(IWT) for dose map reconstruction. Our contributions to this 
work can be summarized as follows: 1) we propose a dose 
prediction framework called Frequency-decomposed Diffusion 
Model (FDDM) for rectum cancer patients, which harnesses the 
generative ability of diffusion models on high-frequency details 
and the strengths of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for 
more precise and efficient dose prediction. 2) we design a 
Coarse Dose Prediction Module (CDPM) to generate the coarse 
map and a High-Frequency Refinement Module (HFRM) that 
performs diffusion operation in the wavelet domain to refine the 
high-frequency components of the dose map. 3) we conduct 
substantial experiments on an in-house dataset comprising 130 
rectum cancer patients, demonstrating the outstanding 
performance of our proposed method. 
 
II. METHODS 
An overview of the proposed FDDM model is illustrated in 
Fig. 2, we first produce a coarse dose map by Coarse Dose 
Prediction Module (CDPM) and do discrete wavelet transform 
(DWT) to resolve the coarse prediction into three high-
frequency subbands and a low-frequency subband. Then we 
introduce a High-Frequency Refinement Module (HFRM) to 
generate refined high-frequency components. Finally, we 
utilize inverse wavelet transformation (IWT) to reconstruct the 
predicted dose map. 
A. Coarse Dose Prediction Module 
To make the predicted dose map encompass as rich 
information as the ground truth, we propose a Coarse Dose 
Prediction Module (CDPM), shown in Fig. 2(a). CDPM takes 
X as input and outputs a coarse dose map 𝑌̂, where X includes 
the original CT images and the segmentation masks of the PTV  
and OARs. Encouraged by the great success of UNet [10], we 
utilize a six-level UNet to construct CDPM. Specifically, the 
encoder involves five modules, where each module contains a 
Residual Block (ResBlock) and a Downsampling block, except 
for the final one. The ResBlock includes two convolutional 
blocks (ConvBlock), each containing a 3 × 3 convolutional 
(Conv) layer, a GroupNorm (GN) layer, and a Swish activation 
function. To address the problem of gradient vanishing during 
training, we introduce residual connections. Furthermore, the 
Downsampling block consists of a 3 × 3 Convolutional layer 
with a stride of 2, allowing for effective downsampling of the 
feature maps. The decoder includes five deconvolution blocks 
to upsample, where each block comprises an Upsampling block 
and two Resblocks with the last one excluding the Upsampling 
block, and each Upsampling block utilizes the Nearest neighbor 
up-sampling and a Conv layer with a kernel size of 1 to 
implement 
the upsampling 
operation. 
Additionally, 
a 
bottleneck is incorporated between the encoder and decoder, 
which consists of two ResBlocks and a self-attention module. 
The skip connections are utilized to enable multi-level feature 
reuse and aggregation between the encoder and decoder. During 
training, we use L1 loss to minimize the content difference 
between the coarse prediction 𝑌̂ and ground truth 𝑌: 
𝐿𝐶𝐷𝑃𝑀= |𝑌̂ −𝑌|.
(1) 
B. Wavelet Frequency Decomposition 
The output of the CDPM is a coarse prediction, which is 
blurred with a few high-frequency details. To solve this 
problem, we refine the high-frequency subbands of the coarse 
dose map. Specifically, we use 2D discrete wavelet 
transformation (DWT) with Haar wavelets [18] to decompose 
the coarse dose map 𝑌̂ ∈𝑅𝐻×𝑊 into four high- and low-
frequency subbands, illustrated in Fig. 2(b). This process can be 
formulated as: 
𝐷𝑊𝑇(𝑌̂) = {𝑌̂𝐿𝐻,𝑌̂𝐻𝐿, 𝑌̂𝐻𝐻,𝑌̂𝐿𝐿},

the low-frequency subband of the dose map, encompassing the 
overall structural information.

C. High-Frequency Refinement Module 
The coarse prediction is over-smoothed without many high-
frequency details, leading to significant differences compared 
to the ground truth on high-frequency subbands. To generate a 
dose map with more details, we propose High-Frequency 
Refinement Modules (HFRM), shown in Fig. 2(c). Our 
proposed HFRM is based on the Denoising Diffusion 
Probabilistic Model (DDPM) [14], which consists of two 
processes: the forward and the reverse process. Different from 
traditional DDPM, we conduct diffusion operations in the 
wavelet domain instead of the image space, which allows for 
accelerated inference speed. Consequently, the forward process 
in HFRM first pred-defines a variance schedule {𝛽 , 𝛽2, … , 𝛽 } 
to progressively transform high-frequency components of the 
dose map 𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
 to a noisy data 𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
 ~ 𝒩(0, 𝐼) through T steps: 
𝑞(𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
|𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
   ) = 𝒩(𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
;√1 −𝛽 𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
   , 𝛽 𝐼).
(3) 
Besides, based on the property of the Markov Chain, we can 
directly get 𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
 at any intermediate timestep t from 𝑥  
through the formula: 
𝑞(𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
|𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
) = 𝒩(𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
; √𝛼̅ 𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
, (1 −𝛼̅ )𝐼) 
                = √𝛼̅ 𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
+ (1 −𝛼̅ )𝜖 ,
(4) 
where 𝛼̅ ≔∏
(1 −𝛽𝑖)
 
𝑖= 
, 𝜖𝑡~𝒩(0, 𝐼). 
In the reverse phase, the HFRM generates images by 
denoising a randomly sampled standard Gaussian noise 
𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
 ~ 𝒩(0, 𝐼) into clear high-frequency subbands 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
, the 
process is also a Gaussian transition. In a classical diffusion 
model, this process is usually conditioned in the image level, 
namely simply concatenating the struct image as an image prior. 
However, the reverse process beginning with a sampled 
randomly Gaussian noise may suffer from a content 
inconsistency between the predicted results and ground truth 
owing to the diversity of the sampling process. Therefore, we 
employ conditions in both the image and feature levels: 
𝑝 (𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
   | 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
) = 𝒩( 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
   ; 𝜇 (𝑌̂ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ,  , 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
, 𝑡), 𝜎 
2𝐼),
(5) 
where 𝜎 
2 is usually a fixed variable related to 𝛽 , and 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
 are 
high-frequency components of coarse prediction, and 
𝜇 (𝑌̂ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ,  , 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
, 𝑡) is usually predicted by a denoising UNet 
𝜖 (𝑌̂ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ,  , 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
, 𝑡): 
𝜇 (𝑌̂ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ,  , 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
, 𝑡) =
1
√𝛼 
(𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
−1 −𝛼 
√1 −𝛼̅ 
𝜖 (𝑌̂ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ,  , 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
, 𝑡)) .
(6) 
The UNet architecture in our proposed HFRM shares the 
same structure as the CDPM.  At the image level, we 
concatenate 
high-frequency 
components 
𝑌̂ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 and 
intermediate result 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
 as input. For the feature level, feature 
maps of CDPM are element-wise added at the first two encoder 
modules, while in the following three encoder modules, we 
apply a cross-attention operation to gain similarity-based 
structure guidance at deeper levels. 
The main goal is to optimize the denoising model 𝜖  to 
achieve a close approximation between the predicted noise 
𝜖 (𝑌̂ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ,  , 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
, 𝑡) in the reverse process and added noise 𝜖  
in the forward process, the training objective can be formulated 
as: 
𝐿𝐻𝐹𝑅𝑀= 𝐸𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
0
, ,𝜖𝑡~𝒩( ,𝐼)[|𝜖 −𝜖 (𝑌̂ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ,  , 𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
, 𝑡)|].
(7) 
D. Dose Map Reconstruction 
After gaining refined high-frequency subbands, we utilize 
IWT on the refined high-frequency subbands and the low-
frequency subband of the coarse dose map to reconstruct the 
dose map. This process is shown in Fig. 2(d) and can be 
formulated as: 
𝑦̃ = 𝐼𝑊𝑇(𝑌 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
 
, 𝑌̂𝑙𝑜𝑤).
(8) 
The whole model is constructed in an end-to-end mode and the 
total loss 𝐿 𝑜 𝑎𝑙 can be formulated as the sum of (1) and (7): 
𝐿 𝑜 𝑎𝑙= 𝐿𝐶𝐷𝑃𝑀+ 𝐿𝐻𝐹𝑅𝑀.

III. EXPERIMENTS 
A. Dataset and Evaluation Metrics 
To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we 
conduct extensive experiments on a dataset curated from an in-
house rectum cancer dataset at West China Hospital. It contains 
130 patients who underwent volumetric modulated arc therapy 
(VMAT) treatment. Every patient contains CT images, OAR 
segmentations, PTV segmentation, and clinically planned dose 
distribution. In addition, OAR segmentations include the small 
intestine (ST), FemoralHeadL(FHL), FemoralHeadR (FHR), 
and bladder (BLD). We randomly select 98, 10, and 22 patients 
for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Before 
training, we split the 3D volumes with a resolution of 
3mm×3mm×3mm into multiple 2D slices with a size of 160 × 
160 along the axial direction. Finally, we obtained 16346 slices 
for training, 1529 slices for validation, and 3491 slices for 
testing. 
We select multiple metrics for the evaluation of our proposed 
model. We employ 𝐷2, 𝐷5 , mean dose ( 𝐷𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛), and 
conformity index (CI) [19] for evaluation. Here Dm denotes the 
lowest dose absorbed that encompasses a volume percentage of 
m% of the PTV. CI is defined as: 
𝐶𝐼=
(𝑉𝑃 𝑉∩𝑉   %𝐼𝑆𝑂)2
𝑉𝑃 𝑉× 𝑉   %𝐼𝑆𝑂
,
(10) 
where 𝑉𝑃 𝑉 represents the volume of the PTV, and 𝑉   %𝐼𝑆𝑂 
indicates the isodose volume, which is a binary mask that is 
assigned a value of 1 when the dose value of a voxel exceeds 
the threshold value, and 0 otherwise. We calculate the 
difference (∆) of these metrics between the predicted results 
and ground truth. Furthermore, we employ the dose volume 
histogram (DVH) [20] as an intuitive metric for comparison.

When DVH curves of the ground truth and predictions are 
closer, we can infer better prediction results. 
B. Implementation Details 
Our proposed method is implemented with the PyTorch 
framework on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 24 GB 
memory.  We use the Adam as optimizer to train the model for 
  00 epochs with a learning rate of  e−  and a  atch size of   . 
Additionally, the time step number of diffusion model T is set 
to 1000 during training. 
C. Comparison with State-Of-The-Art Methods  
We compare the performance of the proposed method to the 
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including UNet [4], U-
ResNet-D [21], deepLabV3+ [6], C3D [12], PRUNet [5], Mc-
GAN [8], and DiffDP [13] for comparison. The quantitative 
comparison results are listed in Table. 1, illustrating the 
superiority of our method over existing SOTA models in all 
metrics. Specifically, compared with DiffDP with the second-
best accuracy in  ∆𝐷5   (0.776 Gy) and  ∆𝐷𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  (0.780 Gy), 
the results generated by the proposed are 0.022 and 0.018 lower, 
respectively. As for  ∆𝐷2 , method outperforms the second-best 
approach by a margin of 0.309 Gy. Furthermore, we also 
display some quantitative results on  ∆𝐷2  of OARs in Fig. 3, 
which demonstrates our proposed method achieves the best 
performance on the OARs. Besides, we also present the DVH 
curves in Fig. 4. Compared with other methods, the disparity 
between the DVH curves of our method and the ground truth is 
the smallest, especially for ST and BLD, demonstrating the 
superior performance of the proposed. Furthermore, we 
visualize the prediction results in Fig.5. As we can see, the dose 
map generated by our proposed method contains more high-
frequency details. Besides, the error map of our proposed 
method appears to be the darkest, indicating the least disparity 
when compared to the ground truth. 
D. Ablation Study 
To verify the effectiveness of pivotal components in our 
proposed method, we conduct a series of ablation experiments. 
The experiment arrangement can be generally concluded as (A) 
only CDPM, (B) only HFRM (use HFRM to directly predict the 
dose map), (C) we use a CDPM to generate a coarse dose map 
and use another CDPM to refine the high-frequency subbands, 
and (D) CDPM+HFRM (the proposed method). we compare the 
experimental results between (B) and (D), compared to (B), (D) 
exhibits a substantial improvement in all four metrics. 
Particularly, in terms of CI, in which (D) outperforms (B) by a 
margin of 0.495, demonstrating its effectiveness. 
The Experimental results are given in Table 2. We can compare 
the results of (A) and (D), after adding HFRM, ∆𝐶𝐼, ∆𝐷2, ∆𝐷5 , 
and ∆𝐷𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 improve a lot with 0.0179, 0.577 Gy, 0.159 Gy, 
and 0.149 Gy, respectively. Besides, we can see that (D) 
outperforms (C) in all metrics, illustrating the generality ability 
of high-frequency details of the HFRM. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION  
In this paper, we present Frequency-Decomposed Diffusion 
Model (FDDM) for robust and efficient rectum cancer dose 
prediction in radiotherapy. Technically, we design a Coarse 
Dose Prediction Module (CDPM) to gain a coarse dose map. 
Besides, we proposed a High-Frequency Refinement Module 
(HFRM) that conducts the diffusion process in the wavelet 
space rather than the image space to generate a more accurate 
dose map. Moreover, we condition our proposed HFRM in both 
the image and feature level for better guidance. The 
experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly 
outperforms other methods.
