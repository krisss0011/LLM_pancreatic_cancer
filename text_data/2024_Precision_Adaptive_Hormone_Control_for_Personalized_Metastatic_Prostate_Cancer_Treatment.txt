With the oncologist acting as the “game leader”, we employ a Stackelberg game-
theoretic model involving multiple populations to study prostate cancer. We refine
the drug dosing schedule using an empirical Bayes feed-forward analysis, based on
clinical data that reflects each patient’s prostate-specific drug response. Our method-
ology aims for a quantitative grasp of the parameter landscape of this adaptive multi-
population model, focusing on arresting the growth of drug-resistant prostate cancer
by promoting competition across drug-sensitive cancer cell populations. Our findings
indicate that not only is it is feasible to considerably extend cancer suppression du-
ration through careful optimization, but even transform metastatic prostate cancer
into a chronic condition instead of an acute one for most patients, with supporting
clinical and analytical evidence.

INTRODUCTION
Although this study focuses on prostate cancer, the underlying principles can also be
applied to various other cancers, especially those that are hormone-sensitive, such as breast
or ovarian cancer. The focus is on the competition among populations within limited eco-
logical niches and how these populations can be controlled. These ecologies are defined by
their carrying capacities, which refer to the maximum number of organisms that the local
environment’s resources can sustain.
In the prostate gland, cells are responsive to male androgens, which function as resources
regulating tissue cell death and proliferation. Under normal conditions, prostate tissue cells
grow and die at rates dictated by androgen levels, maintaining glandular homeostasis. How-
ever, prostate cancer cells ignore these androgen limits, persist in their growth toward the
gland’s carrying capacity, and result in a larger tumor. When this local growth boundary is
achieved, cancer cells may metastasize to different areas, where they form new environments
with distinct carrying capacities. The coarse-grained characterization of these processes we
employ in modeling metastatic cancer suggests that the body has a certain carrying capacity,
which affects the general dynamics of tumor development and dissemination.
Hormone deprivation therapy aims to restrict proliferation and eliminate androgen-
dependent prostate cells by removing androgen growth hormones. However, prostate cancer
cells can develop resistance to this therapy, allowing them to continue dividing even without
growth hormones. Resistant cells might (1) already exist within the prostate tumor before
the initial treatment due to genetic or epigenetic diversity [1–3], or (2) arise as de novo
resistant cells through a process of natural selection [4–7].
The two distinct cell types, which are either sensitive or resistant to androgens, can
compete within a shared environment, creating a scenario akin to a resource game. Although
the overall carrying capacity is dictated by the maximum number of cells that can occupy a
particular environment, the proportion of androgen-sensitive and -resistant cells may vary
based on their competitive interactions.
Testosterone serves as the primary male androgen. Androgens like testosterone attach
to androgen receptors found on the surfaces of prostate cells. Through a complex signaling
pathway, the occupation of these receptors stimulates the proliferation and apoptosis of
androgen-sensitive cells. These cells, whose growth and demise are regulated by testosterone,
3
are referred to as T+ cells due to their reliance on bound androgen receptors for growth and
survival.
Over time, prostate tissue may develop, or may already contain, cells (T+/−) with an
increased number of androgen receptors, which enhances their sensitivity to testosterone
and allows them to proliferate with lower testosterone levels. Because these cells can thrive
even when testosterone is reduced, they are labeled as “resistant” to leuprorelin, though
their resistance is indirectly related to the drug. This resistance can progress, leading to
the emergence or preexistence of prostate cancer cells that can grow entirely without testos-
terone, known as T−cells. These cells are not effectively managed by standard androgen
deprivation therapy, meaning that even when leuprorelin levels are elevated, T−prostate
cancer cells continue to proliferate.
As previously discussed, prostate cancer exhibits significant heterogeneity; our analysis
focuses solely on differentiated cells and the PSA levels they produce. There is, however, a
category of undifferentiated prostate cancer cells (PSA−\lo) that do not secrete PSA, express
stem cell markers, are resistant to androgen deprivation therapy, and demonstrate both high
clonogenic capability and long-term tumor-propagating potential [8]. This is because they
can progress to a differentiated state and divide asymmetrically to generate T + cells. This
process of de-differentiation and genuine evolution is beyond the scope of this paper.
The regulation of metastatic prostate cancer through adaptive hormone therapy employs
the concentration of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the patient’s body as an indicator
of the number of cancer cells present.
PSA, however, constitutes a flawed measure for
quantifying prostate cells—encompassing both normal and malignant varieties [9, 10]. PSA
is generated by both normal prostate cells and cancerous ones. An uptick in PSA levels in
the bloodstream, which hints at unusual proliferation of prostate cells, prompts the initial
therapeutic approach of administering leuprorelin. Leuprorelin functions as an agonist at
the pituitary gland’s gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors, ultimately leading
to a reduction in testosterone production by testicular cells, thereby inhibiting growth and
leading to the apoptosis of T+ prostate cells.
Patients with high levels of leuprorelin continued therapy are said to be “chemically
castrated”, but this is an entirely reversible condition if leuprorelin administration is ceased,
unlike surgical castration.
One explanation for why patients undergoing chemical castration with leuprorelin ex-
4
hibit persistent PSA elevations in cases of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
(mCRPC) is that testosterone is also synthesized in the adrenal glands. To address this,
abiraterone acetate is administered, which inhibits androgen synthesis in the adrenal glands,
further diminishing testosterone levels beyond what is achieved with leuprorelin therapy
alone. Abiraterone acts by inhibiting the CYP17A1 enzyme, essential for the production of
androgens (male hormones) in the testes, adrenal glands, and prostate cancer tissue [11]. By
blocking this enzyme, the drug significantly reduces the production of androgen steroid hor-
mones, particularly testosterone, which plays a critical role in determining the proliferation
capacity of these sensitive cells.
The patients we are concerned with here are all mCRPC patients who still have popula-
tions of T+, T+/−and T−cells. The task in this paper is to optimize the suppression of T−
cell growth through competition with T+ and T+/−cells for mCRPC patients.
The concept of cancer adaptive chemotherapy [12] can be understood through the lens
of Stackelberg sequential game theory [13]. Here, the oncologist leverages the ecological
competition for shared resources among cancer cells, aiming to increase populations of drug-
sensitive subclones that, in turn, help inhibit the proliferation of drug-resistant ones [14, 15].
Instead of being seen as conclusive, the mathematical models employed to describe cancer
population dynamics during treatment should be considered as heuristic tools. These provide
oncologists with a framework to analytically grasp and influence cancer progression.
The effectiveness of adaptive chemotherapy arises from the competition among differ-
ent cell populations for (1) a limited cell carrying capacity and (2) the extent to which
cells compete with one another even when not close to the carrying capacity. In both sce-
narios (approaching the carrying capacity or inter-population competition), a more game-
oriented dominant sub-population can hinder the growth of the game-oriented minority
sub-population. Such game-oriented suppression can even prevent a quicker-reproducing,
drug-resistant phenotype from expanding. In situations involving purely competitive sup-
pression of growth rates near the carrying capacity, adaptive chemotherapy can delay the
breakthrough of resistant cell populations, but it eventually falls short [16]. Nevertheless, as
we will demonstrate, if the competition coefficients sufficiently favor the sensitive cells, it is
feasible to indefinitely suppress resistant cell populations even when far from their carrying
capacity.
In adaptive chemotherapy, the clinician dictates the treatment strategy through dose
5
scheduling. Ideally, both dose intensity and duration could be adjusted. However, if dose
intensity remains fixed, then the PSA on-level and off-level serve as two modifiable trig-
ger parameters to modify drug dosage. Currently, in clinical adaptive treatments, these
adjustable parameters have not been optimized for maximum drug efficiency or response
duration [12] and are instead set at an arbitrary 50% of the baseline PSA level [17].
As Hansen and Read have noted [16], it is feasible to select the PSA on-level for admin-
istering drugs to be above the initial baseline measurement at the start of treatment. This
choice should ensure that the count of drug-sensitive cancer cells, T+, approaches the total
carrying capacity, while T−remains significantly below it. In a straightforward model with
two populations—where the first group, comprising T+ and T+/−, is sensitive to drugs, and
the second group, consisting only of T−, is resistant—the PSA off-level should be nearly
equal to the on-level. Both levels need to be near the carrying capacity to keep drug-sensitive
cells close to their maximum and to limit the proliferation of drug-resistant cells.
These two concepts, (1) positioning the PSA trigger on level to maintain the total cell
number near the total body carrying capacity and (2) setting the differential between on
and off as small as possible are not new [16]. What we have further explored and propose
here are:
• A systematic statistical approach to determine, from clinical data, important param-
eters describing cancer progression, including personalized growth rates and compe-
tition coefficients, as well as personalized parameters such as the initial number of
cancer cells relative to carrying capacity and drug effectiveness, in the fundamental
game theory model described in Section II. The details are provided in Section IV.
• The possibility, in favorable patient cases, of extending the period of cancer suppres-
sion below a threshold or even making prostate cancer chronic rather than progressive,
albeit with continued therapy throughout the patient’s lifetime. We show how these
outcomes can be achieved via a high level tight control adaptive chemotherapy in Sec-
tion V using Bayesian optimization. We provide analytical justifications and estimates
for these findings, see Appendix B.

A SIMPLIFIED STACKELBERG GAME THEORY MODEL OF
6
ADAPTIVE THERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER
Consider an ensemble of Nk(t) cancer cell subpopulations (indexed by k); the total number
of cancer cells is given by N(t) = P
k Nk(t), and the PSA level is assumed to obey the
following ordinary differential equation (ODE):
d
dtPSA(t) = λN(t) −Ξ PSA(t) ,
(1)
where the PSA decay rate is Ξ ∼3.5 × 10−1/day (corresponding to a characteristic decay
timescale of about a few days [18]) and λ is the PSA production rate per cell, assumed
uniform across sub-populations. It is crucial to note that not all cancer cells produce PSA
in the same way or at consistent levels over time; here we are relying on a rather simplistic
assumption for such a complex disease to guide our estimation for parameters that describe
cancer dynamics. Since the rate Ξ is significantly larger than the cancer cell growth rates
(which ranges from 2 × 10−3 to 2 × 10−2/day, as estimated in [17]), we can further adopt
the additional quasi-steady state approximation (QSA):
PSA(t) ≈(λ/Ξ) N(t) ,
(2)
meaning that the system is considered highly overdamped.
The oncologist (the “game leader”), begins somewhere in the game at an unknown point,
presented with a patient showing elevated PSA levels, that is we do NOT know the carrying
capacity of the patient’s tumor. Let us consider a simplified version for the basic case of
only two prostate cancer cell sub-populations under the influence of a single drug: (1) a
drug-sensitive population NS(t), and (2) a drug-resistant population NR(t). In this model,
we assume no treatment- or time-dependence to their phenotypes. That is, there is no de
novo resistance evolution: no phenotype switching or mutagentic response in the cancer
cells to hormone deprivation. Both cell phenotypes share a common cell carrying capacity
K in the absence of treatment. The cancer dynamics is then described by the following two
simple coupled ODEs [17]:
d
dtNS(t) = rS

1 −
NS(t) + NR(t)
K [1 −γΛ(t)]

d
dtNR(t) = rR

1 −
NR(t) + αRSNS(t)
K

NR(t) ,
(3)
in which rS, rR > 0 are maximum growth rates of sensitive and resistant cells; the cells com-
pete for a resource (testosterone) with the competition coefficient αRS ≥0. This coefficient
7
represent how the two cell types interact and affect each other indirectly through their dis-
tinct metabolisms and influence on the tumor microenvironment [19]. In Eq. (3), the effect
of the drug is to reduce the carrying capacity for sensitive cells by a factor of γΛ(t), where
Λ(t) denotes the time-dependent level of the drug administered to the patient. The value γ
represents the drug effectiveness, 0 ≤γ ≤1. We take Λ(t) to be binary: Λ(t) = 0 during
periods of no drug administration, and Λ(t) = 1 during periods of (maximum) dosage. The
use of γΛ(t) may appear ad-hoc, but it is predicated the presence of Abiraterone, which
reduces the carrying capacity by a factor of (1 −γ) for only drug-sensitive T+ populations,
but stays unchanged for resistant T−populations.
Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) contain six parameters, i.e. {rS, rR, αRS, γ, K, λ}. Presumably all
these parameters are patient-specific. In addition, there are at least two more unknowns,
related to the initial cancer population sizes {xS(0), xR(0)} for each patient. It is important
to note that at t = 0 for each patient, they have already received other treatments (e.g.,
chemical castration) in preparation for the study. The modeler must determine parameter
values of each patient. In previous work by Zhang et al. [20], finding unique patient-specific
parameters was not done systematically. Simulations were carried out assuming all patients
entered the trial at roughly half of that value, guaranteeing that adaptive therapy would have
a profound effect. This assumption of being close to carrying capacity in the simulations was
carried forward into the clinical trials, where PSA levels were set to a normalized value of 1 for
all patients to be near the carrying capacity. There was no attempt to actually determine
carrying capacity from a dose-response experiment. In subsequent work by Zhang et al.
[17], the parameters have been determined systematically but under an arbitrary choice
for drug effectiveness and an assumption that the cancer growth rates are identical across
patients, which is not supported by the data. Furthermore, the trigger points for on/off for
abiraterone therapy were arbitrarily set (the PSA off-level is half that of the PSA on-level),
with no attempt to optimize these values.
Hansen and Read et al. [16] realized that the Zhang et al. [17] lacked optimization. They
pointed out that actually setting the off trigger close to the carrying capacity, and setting
the on trig as close as possible to the one one actually could significantly improve patient
time to progression, which of course makes sense since maintaining the T + population at
as high a value as possible within the confines of this simple model can only help suppress
the T−population. This was an imporyant advance, but unfortunately Hansen and Read
8
presented no systematic procedure for actually determining carrying capacity numbers from
patient data.
As they point out, if one starts far from the carrying capacity and with
closely matched populations of T+ and T−an adaptive protocol can actually suppress the
T+ population and help the T−, a disaster.
The only way to achieve a true patient specific model of that patient’s disease state
is through experimentation, i.e. administering brief doses of Abiraterone and measuring
PSA levels over time to fit all the parameters to the measured PSA trajectories for each
patient. Once parameters are established, the oncologist can use them to project the future of
cancer progression for each patient in a Stackelberg game, and can even perform treatment
optimization and open-loop planning.
To begin, we need to make some assumptions to
reduce the number of free parameters, ensuring that the fit remains predictive while avoiding
excessive aggregating/simplification that could lead to an inaccurate prediction of cancer
progression under treatment.
III.
A MORE DETAILED STACKELBERG GAME THEORY MODEL OF
ADAPTIVE THERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER
A central problem in achieving a truly personal, patient-specific model for treating
mCRPC is the large number of free parameters. For a patient with fewer than ∼10 PSA
blood level measurements (typically, a patient in [17] has around ∼20 measurements), the
parameters in the ODEs in Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) cannot be reliably identified when fitting
observational data. We therefore now consider constraining these parameters while being
careful not to arbitrarily fix too many of them.
For any individual patient, we can re-write the system of ODEs describing the evolution
of the observable PSA level and the cancer progression, i.e. Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), as follows:
PSA(t) ≈˜λx(t) ,
d
dtxS(t) = rS

1 −
xS(t) + xR(t)
1 −γΛ(t)

xS(t) ,
d
dtxR(t) = rR
h
1 −

xR(t) + αRSxS(t)
i
xR(t) ,
(4)
in which xS(t), xR(t), and x(t) ≡xS(t) + xR(t) are the sensitive, resistant, and total cancer
cell populations respectively, scaled by a common carrying capacity K:
xS(t) ≡NS(t)/K , xR(t) ≡NR(t)/K .
(5)
9
The quantity ˜λ ≡(λ/Ξ)K is the ratio of the PSA production rate to its decay rate when
the cancer reaches its carrying capacity; this is also equal to the carrying capacity PSA
measurement under QSA:
PSAK ≡PSA

x=1 = ˜λ .
(6)
It is important to note that cancer can cause symptoms, complications, and even become
lethal before x(t) reaches 1.
Assuming that the above description is adequate across patients, then if the seven pa-
rameters {˜λ, rS, rR, αRS, γ, xS(0), xR(0)} are known for each and every patient, the PSA
trajectories can be fully determined using Eq. (4) for any drug treatment schedule Λ(t).
Note that all of these parameters may differ between patients; however, by assuming some
are common, we can still achieve a good fit for all patients and, most important, infer some
general behavior of prostate cancer biophysics to guide and optimize treatments. Also, not
all of these parameters are of equal importance. As we will discuss in Section V, the pa-
rameters that have the most influence on patient outcomes, when treatment is optimal, are
the common ecological competition coefficient αRS and the patient-specific biomarker level
at carrying capacity PSAK = ˜λ.
Consider the relative kinetics between sensitive and resistant cells to be universal across
patients. This means that the growth and competition of sensitive and resistant cells are
locally identical across patients, differing only by a timescale. We can thus further divide
the seven parameters into two sets:
• The two common parameters {rS/rR, αRS}, representing the ratio between growth
rates and the ecological competition coefficient.
• The five patient-specific parameters
{˜λ, rR, γ, xS(0), xR(0)} ,
(7)
which are the PSA measurement when the cancer population reaches carrying capacity,
the resistant cell growth rate, the drug effectiveness, and the initial populations sizes
of the two different cancer cell phenotypes at the beginning of PSA tracking for each
individual patient. This is the smallest set of parameters that should not be identical
across patients.
10
In contrast to the previous study [17], here we acknowledge that cancer growth and patient
responses to drug may vary drastically between individuals. These considerations are con-
sistent with crude estimations of growth rates for a subset of patients [17] and with findings
related to Abiraterone responses [21, 22]. We also did not fix any parameter values before
fitting the model, as [17] did for γ = 90% and rS/rR = 1.66 [17]; instead, we obtain these
values from the fitting procedure. Note that we did explore other options for both common
parameters and patient-specific parameters, but the selection above appears to provide the
best fit.
If the common parameters are known, early measurements of PSA(t) during on- and
off-drug periods allow us to estimate the patient-specific parameters. These estimates can
be updated and refined as additional data becomes available. We can then use Eq. (4) to
predict future PSA(t) observations and the growth trajectories of the two cell types, sensitive
xS(t) and resistant xR(t), in response to different drug administration schedules.
The only explicitly time dependent term in Eq. 4 is Λ(t), and it lies at the heart of the
clinician strategy. In principle Λ(t) can be any function of time, yet, given the realities of
delivering chemotherapy to patients, we assume that drug delivery is determined not directly
by time but rather by trigger levels of measured PSA. That is, we allow only two knobs to
tune: the on-level PSA↑and off-level PSA↓. In adaptive therapy, the drug is administered
when the patient PSA level surpasses the on-level PSA↑and continues until it decreases to
the off-level PSA↓. Drug administration is then resumed only when the PSA level returns
to PSA↑.
The clinician goal is to prevent the patient from staying in a state of developing symptoms
(e.g. as urinary issues, erectile dysfunction, pelvic pain, bone pain), which emerge when their
prostate cancer have advanced far enough. We denote the PSA level at which symptoms
begin to appear as PSAthr, a value that is not known in advance.
At that stage, drug
administration cannot be delayed without risking further complications. For all patients in
[17], Abiraterone was first administered to all patients well before any signs of symptoms
appeared. We define the two policy parameters, η↑and η↓, so that PSA↑is a fraction η↑of
the clinician acceptable upper limit PSAthr, and PSA↓is a fraction η↓of PSA↑:
PSA↑≡η↑PSAthr , PSA↓≡η↓PSA↑= η↑η↓PSAthr .
(8)
The values of η↑and η↓are therefore bounded between 0 and 1.
11
Given this formulation, patient-informed parameters and the PSA threshold value PSAthr,
we can now attempt to determine what the optimal treatment policy should be for the
patient.
IV.
PATIENT-INFORMED PARAMETER ESTIMATION
A.
Clinical Data and Nonlinear Mixed Effect
We reanalyze the clinical data from [17], which includes N = 32 patients undergoing
Abiraterone treatment. Note that these patients have already received treatment to block
male hormone production from the pituitary gland, which accounts for approximately ∼90%
of total production.
Abiraterone is used as an additional therapy, to inhibit androgen
production from other sources, including the adrenal glands and the tumor itself, which
contribute the remaining ∼10% of total production. Considerations in our analysis differ
from those of [17] in certain direction:
FIG. 1: Time series of PSA levels for all N = 32 patients, for alternative normalizations. (A)
The PSA level in ng/L. (B) The PSA level as normalized in Zhang et al. [17], in which the maximum
value of any given PSA time series after the normalization is always at 1. (C) The normalized PSA level is
adjusted so that the value at the start of the first treatment in any given PSA time series is always set to 1
after normalization.
• In Fig. 1A we show the raw time series data for the PSA level (in ng/L) of all patients.
12
It is very important to note that these data are widely different in scale (the maximum
value in each of these PSA time series ranges from ∼2ng/L to ∼200ng/L), so before
fitting the model to all patients, we need to normalize them to ensure comparability
between patients. If not, the fit will then be overly controlled by the highly volatile
patients. Here, we normalize each patient’s PSA measurement data using the PSA
value at the time Abiraterone was first administered (see Fig. 1C), instead of the
maximum PSA value as in [17] (see Fig. 1B). This choice for normalization not only
still ensures comparability between PSA time series across all patients, but also allows
for data updates without necessitating changes to previous entries.
• We decide to relax the assumption in [17] that the cancer growth rates rS and rR
are identical for all patients. This is consistent with the values estimated for patients
receiving continuous drug treatment, ranging from 2 × 10−3 to 2 × 10−2/day [17].
Instead, we permit rR to vary among patients while treating the ratio of these rates,
rS/rR, as universal. We do not pre-set rS/rR.
• We let the drug effectiveness γ to be a free parameter instead of fixing it.
This
allows for variability in how different patients respond to the drug, and provides a
more accurate assessment of how close the initial total cancer cell population is to the
carrying capacity, i.e. how close x(0) is to 1.
• The model is nonlinear in both common as well as person specific (mixed) factors. For
this reason, we utilize an established statistical approach, the empirical Bayes approach
of Lindstrom and Bates [23], to fit the model to the normalized PSA data within the
framework of nonlinear mixed effects (NLME). The estimated parameters for fitting
the model to the data are selected so as to maximize the observation likelihood, meaning
they provide the best possible explanation for the patterns seen in the data. Not only
do we have estimates for the two common parameters {αRS, rS/rR}, we also obtain
probability distributions for four patient-specific parameters
{rR, γ, xS(0), xR(0)} .
(9)
Estimation of the patient-specific parameters benefits from regarding them as samples
from a distribution, since it statistically addresses the regression to the mean for
extreme values.
13
• We do not assign weights differently (and rather arbitrarily) to different events (e.g.
the first data points after a treatment change, from off-drug to on-drug and vice versa,
are weighted five times more than the others in [17]). Here, all data points are treated
the same.
Note that there are five patient-specific parameters as previously mentioned in Eq. (7), but
Eq. (9) addresses only four: the fifth, ˜λ, is determined by the other four.
To be more precise, let us denote the two common parameters as Θ ≡{αRS, rS/rR}
and the four patient-specific parameters (besides ˜λ) as θ ≡{γ, rR, xS(0), xR(0)}, and use
the subscript µ to specify the individual patient, i.e. θµ. For each patient µ in [17], we
know their given Abiraterone treatment schedule Λµ(t), and the measurement times tmµ
(where mµ labels the time point) at which they have their PSA level recorded, as well as
the measured values PSAµ(tmµ). If m(treat)
µ
is the time point when Abiraterone was first
administered, then the normalized PSA level can be calculated with:
PSAµ(tmµ) = PSAµ(tmµ)/PSAµ(tm(treat)
µ
) .
(10)
For a given {Θ, θµ; Λµ(t)}, we can use Eq. (4) to obtain theoretically what trajectory the
total cancer cell population should be,1 which we denote as x{Θ,θµ;Λµ(t)}(t). The theoretical
trajectory for the normalized PSA level, therefore, follows from Eq. (4) if ˜λµ is known:
PSA
{Θ,θµ;Λµ(t)}(t) = ˜λµx{Θ,θµ;Λµ(t)}(t)/PSAµ(tm(treat)
µ
) .
(11)
We then estimate ˜λµ by minimizing the sum squared-errors (SSE) between the observational
PSAµ(tmµ) and the theoretical PSA
{Θ,θµ;Λµ(t)}(tmµ):
˜λµ = arg min

MatLab R2023a [24].

B.
Statistical Assumptions
To use the Lindstrom-Bates empirical Bayes (LBEB) approach for NLME [23], we need
to make some statistical assumptions:
• The discrepancies in the data fit are sampled from a combined-variance Gaussian noise,
which includes both a constant component and a component that is proportional to
the “true” value. This means that measurements for a larger “true” value are allowed
to exhibit greater variability, i.e.:
PSAµ(tmµ) = PSA
{Θ,θµ;Λµ(t)}(tmµ) + ηµ(tmµ) ,
(13)
where the errors ηµ(tmµ) are sampled from a Gaussian distribution:

Here A, B are two unknown positive constants, and N(0, 1) represents the Gaussian
distribution centered at 0 with a variance of 1.
• The four patient-specific parameters {rR, (1−γ), xS(0), xR(0)} are assumed to be sam-
pled from four log-normal distributions [25]. Note that we consider (1 −γ) to be sam-
pled from a log-normal distribution, not γ, because observations (PSA levels before
and after Abiraterone administration) suggest that γ is typically much closer to 1 than
0.
We then apply the LBEB approach2 to estimate the common parameters {rS/rR, αRS}, the
log-normal distributions of {rR, (1 −γ), xS(0), xR(0)}, and the values {rR, γ, xS(0), xR(0)}
of each patient, and also the two constants A, B that characterized our noise function, so
that the observations across patients can be the most likely ones (maximum likelihood).

Best-Fit Results
We start by acknowledging that the clinical data is extremely noisy, which should be
expected. The fit found in Zhang et al. [17], while not quantitative, does capture nearly all

the qualitative behavior of every patients regarding PSA response on- and off-drug. However,
the total SSE for all patients of this fit is very large, which motivates us to reanalyze their
data.
While we still consider two common parameters, we now use four patient-specific
parameters instead of only two, resulting in a significantly better fit, as shown in Fig. 2 and
Fig. 3. The total SSE has been reduced by more than a factor of three, from 170.68 for
Zhang et al. [17] fit to 57.52 for our LBEB approach. The SSE for individual patients is
also typically smaller using our approach (26 out of 32).

name, SSE for Zhang et al. [17] fit, and the LBEB fit. The cyan line marks drug use periods, orange dots
represent normalized PSA Eq. (10), the light-blue dashed line shows Zhang et al. [17] best fit, and the blue
line shows the LBEB best fit.
We find the best common parameter values to be rS/rR = 2.97±0.02 and αRS = 5.2±0.9.
This provides strong evidence that rS > rR. The large value for the competition coefficient
αRS between resistant and sensitive cells agrees with the findings of [17], indicating the
robustness of this estimation even with different approaches. The patient-specific parameters
are sampled from
rR ∼(7.0 × 10−3) exp [0.7 N(0, 1)] , γ ∼1 −(4.0 × 10−2) exp [1.5 N(0, 1)] ,
xS(0) ∼(4.1 × 10−2) exp [2.4 N(0, 1)] , xR(0) ∼(2.3 × 10−2) exp [1.8 N(0, 1)] .

name, SSE for Zhang et al. [17] fit, and the LBEB fit. The cyan line marks drug use periods, orange dots
represent normalized PSA Eq. (10), the light-blue dashed line shows Zhang et al. [17] best fit, and the blue
line shows the LBEB best fit.
We report the individual values for the patient-specific parameters in Appendix A. Fig. 4A
shows a slight positive trend (presented in log-log plot) between the resistant cell growth
rate rR and the drug ineffectiveness 1 −γ. This indicates that in patients where cancer
cells can multiply quickly and thrive, Abiraterone is usually less effective in suppressing the
disease. Fig. 4B reveals that, initially before treatment, sensitive cells contribute the most
to prohibiting the growth of resistant cells (compared to resistant cells themselves). We
show the monotonic relationship between the PSA level at the time of first drug treatment,
PSA(tmtreat), and the PSA level at carrying capacity, PSAK, in Fig.
4C. For 27 out of
the total N = 32 patients, PSA(tmtreat)/PSAK > 1/αRS, which carries significant clinical
implications that we will discuss in Section V B.
D.
Comparison between Models
It should, of course, be expected that with more free parameters we should achieve
better a fit. Therefore, we need to assess whether the improved fit justifies the additional
parameters and helps avoid overfitting, ensuring that the model will perform well on new

data.
For linear regression, the standard metric for “goodness-of-fit” is given by the R2-value
[26]. A direct generalization of this dimensionless metric for nonlinear models [27, 28] is
commonly referred to as the Efron’s pseudo-R2-value [29], is given by ˜R2 = 1 −˜A. The
coefficient of alienation ˜A, defined as [28]:
˜A = SSE
SSdata
≥0 ,
(15)
where SSdata is the data variance (i.e. SSE with respect to the mean value). This measures
the proportion of residual variation in the nonlinear model compared to a null model with
no explanatory power, indicating how much the model deviates from an ideal fit. An ideal fit
corresponds to ˜R2 = 1. While there are many other different proposals for goodness-of-fit de-
18
pending on the specific characteristics of the nonlinear model being used [30–32], the Efron’s
pseudo- ˜
R2-value remains a useful metric due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation [28].
Since the number of parameters in the fit models that we use are not the same, i.e.
nparams = (2 × N) + 2 = 66 in Zhang et al. [17] and nparams = (4 × N) + 2 = 130 in our
approach, we need to calculate the adjusted Efron’s psuedo-R2-value [33] instead:
˜R2
adj = 1 −SSE/(ndata −nparams)
SSdata/(ndata −1)
.
(16)
We have ndata = 678 and SSdata = 176.16. The closer ˜R2
adj is to 1, the more we can trust
a fitted model. We obtain ˜R2
adj ≈−0.08 for Zhang et al. [17] fit and ˜R2
adj ≈0.60 for our
LBEB fit, which corroborates our approach.
V.
OPTIMIZATION OF TREATMENT WITH ABIRATERONE
Within our adaptive therapy policy framework, our goal is to determine the optimal
policy parameters (η↑, η↓) that maximize the total achievable time τtot we can keep the
cancer progression (with treatment) below the biomarker level PSAthr, the level at which
the patient begins to show symptoms, in order to avoid further complications. Consider
the patients with two common parameters Θ = {rS/rR, αRS} and the five patient-specific
parameters {PSAK, θ} = {˜λ, rR, γ, xS(0), xR(0)}, as found according to Section IV C. Note
that PSAK = ˜λ follows, as explained in Eq. (6). For simplification, we further assume that
the PSA level is measured continuously, and that there is no noise in these measurements,
so that the decision to turn on and off drug treatment based on the policy parameters as
described in Eq. (8) is exact. Hence, we can calculate the total achievable time τtot below
PSAthr using policy parameters (η↑, η↓) for a patient µ with parameters {Θ, PSAKµ, θµ},3
and we denote its full functional form as τ
{Θ,PSAK µ,θµ},PSAthr
tot
(η↑, η↓). We can simplify this
expression to τ {µ},PSAthr
tot
(η↑, η↓), and further drop all superscripts when it is clear which
patient and what threshold are referred to.
As we will show in this Section through computer-assisted modeling, if the PSA threshold
is too low PSAthr ≤PSAKµ/αRS (remember that 1/αRS ≈0.19), then for any policy
parameters (η↑, η↓), the treatment appears to eventually fail, i.e. hence we can only hope to

somewhat prolong the drug response total achievable time τtot. However, if this threshold
is just high enough PSAthr > PSAKµ/αRS, then sometimes, but not always, it is possible
to find a treatment policy that arrests the cancer progression indefinitely τtot →∞. We
provide some analytical explanation for these possibilities in Section B.
A.
PSAthr/PSAKµ ≤1/αRS
Here, we search for the (global) maximum of the total achievable time (with treatment)
below the PSA threshold, τ {µ},PSAthr
tot
(η↑, η↓) over this multi-dimensional space (η↑, η↓). We
employ a Bayesian optimization approach [34] to efficiently navigate through the policy pa-
rameter space by data-driven extrapolation (kriging [35]) for the two-dimensional landscape
τ {µ},PSAthr
tot
(η↑, η↓) for patient µ with a given PSAthr. This method, when applied to an ob-
jective function to be extremize, begins by evaluating that function at a number of random
positions so as to (approximately) gauge its global features (using a surrogate model e.g. a
Gaussian process [36]). It then uses Bayesian inference to predict the optimal next func-
tion evaluation location, balancing exploitation and exploration, and evaluate the function
there. This iterative step continuously updates its estimation of the function, keeps find-
ing and checking new locations and corresponding values, until the difference between two
consecutive locations becomes sufficiently small (for a practical resolution of the parameter
space).

is δη = 0.01. Note that the upper bounds for η↑and η↓are both set at 0.90 instead of 1.00,
as smaller differences (less that 10%) are clinically difficult to monitor [16]. We start by

Optimal Treatment for Maximum τtot
The optimization described in Section V A 1 can be applied to any patient; however, for
illustrative purposes, we will consider patient P1007 as labelled in Fig. 2. This patient has
small values for xS(0) and xR(0), with xS(0) ≫xR(0), allowing them to undergo several
drug treatment cycles. We investigate τtot(η↑, η↓) for PSAthr/PSAK = 0.14 and 0.19. Fig. 5
shows the GPR extrapolated surface functions

(22)
for these different PSA thresholds, i.e. PSAthr/PSAK = 0.14 in Fig. 5A and PSAthr/PSAK =
0.19 in Fig.
5B. The optimal policy parameter values (η∗
↑, η∗
↓) is located at the corner
(0.90, 0.90), corresponding to the highest possible on-drug PSA level with the tightest control
(η↓is maximum). We will see that this is consistent with our analytical considerations in
Section B.
Fig.
6 shows our numerical findings for simulated treatments on this patient, using
different policy parameters:
• Panel (A,D): Cancer progression under continuous Abiraterone treatment often results
in resistant cells rapidly overtaking the population, causing the cancer to exceed the
thresholds faster. Note that continuous therapy is a special case of adaptive therapy
in which the off -drug policy parameter η↓is set to 0.
• Panel (B,E): Cancer progression under a (non-optimal) adaptive Abiraterone treat-
ment, in which PSA↑is as high as possible and PSA↓is set to 50% of PSA↑. This

FIG. 5: Bayesian optimization using a GPR model to search for the maximum total drug
response time τtot for patient P1007 under adaptive chemotherapy. We consider different PSA
threshold values, i.e. PSAthr/PSAK = 0.14 in (A) and PSAthr/PSAK = 0.19. Here we show the Gaussian
extrapolated surfaces of the total achievable time, as given in Eq. (22). The circles represent the points where
the total achievable time is evaluated by numerical simulation. The star indicates the point of convergence
for the search, which corresponds to the global maxmimum.
treatment has been used in studies and clinical trials [17].
Since the drug is not
used to suppress sensitive cells constantly, these cells are allowed to recover and keep
competing with the resistant ones longer, hence the total achievable time is extended.
• Panel (C,F): Cancer progression under the optimal adaptive treatment, found from
Bayesian optimization.
This suggests that, the closer the PSA level at which the
patient starts showing symptoms PSAthr is to PSAK/αRS (which is rather far from
when the cancer population may reach carrying capacity, since αRS ≫1), the more
effective optimal adaptive therapy can be in prolonging the time gained compared to
continuous treatment.
We observe in Fig. 5 that the most effective adaptive therapies maintain tight control of
PSA levels with the highest on-drug PSA level, i.e. η↓, η↑→1, a strategy we refer to as
high level tight control (HLTC). This treatment cycle involves administering Abiraterone
in short bursts, followed by extended resting periods, at a high frequency. We report our
found optimal policy parameters (η∗
↑, η∗
↓) for all patients with x(0) < PSAthr/PSAK in the

FIG. 6: Slowing down cancer progression. We explore the dynamics of cancer progression under
different treatments, for small PSA thresholds i.e. PSAthr/PSAK = 0.14 in (A,B,C) and 0.19 in (D,E,F).
We show the response of patient P1007 under a continuous therapy with η↑= 0.90 in (A,D), under a
continuous therapy with (η↑, η↓) = (0.90, 0.50) in (B,E), and under a continuous therapy with (η↑, η↓) =
(0.90, 0.90) in (C,F). The black arrow indicates the PSA threshold level for each plot.
Appendix C, most of those are also (0.90, 0.90). We will provide an analytical justification
for this finding in Section B.
B.
PSAthr/PSAKµ > 1/αRS
Out of N
= 32 patients, 27 of them have PSA(tmtreat
µ
)/PSAKµ > 1/αRS, where
PSA(tmtreat
µ
) is the PSA levels of patient µ when Abiraterone is first administrated (see
Fig. 4C). Since PSA(tmtreat
µ
) < PSAthr (all patients show no symptom at t = tmtreat
µ
), this
that the condition PSAthr/PSAKµ > 1/αRS is commonly satisfied.
While the total achievable time τtot(η↑, η↓) is always finite for PSAthr < PSAKµ/αRS, as
24
FIG. 7: Chronic cancer progression. We explore the long-time dynamics of cancer progression under
different treatments, for a large PSA threshold i.e.
PSAthr/PSAK = 0.24.
We show the response of
patient P1007 under a continuous therapy with η↑= 0.90 in (A), under an adaptive therapy with (η↑, η↓) =
(0.90, 0.50) in (B), and under adaptive therapy with (η↑, η↓) = (0.90, 0.90) in (C). The black arrow indicates
the PSA threshold for each plot.
resistant cells will eventually dominate the cancer population after many drug administration
cycles, for PSAthr > PSAKµ/αRS it might become possible to keep the number of resistant
cells under control forever. This can be realized only when the number of sensitive cells can
reduce faster than the resistant cells can increast during the on-drug period (i.e. dxS/dt +
dxR/dt < 0), as we will derive in Appendix B. In other words, cancer can then shift from
being a lethal disease to a chronic condition. In Fig. 7, we explore the consequences of
PSAthr/PSAK = 0.24 for the same patient as in Section V A 2, on cancer progression under
adaptive chemotherapy over a long time period. We find that a HLTC treatment can extend
the total achievable time indefinitely (we have checked up to 50 years ≈1.8 × 104 days), as
illustrated in Fig. 7C. However, if the PSA off-level PSA↓is too low, a threshold breach can
still occur, as seen in Fig. 7B. Continuous treatment appears to always result in negative
outcomes, as shown in Fig. 7A.
What we have observed in this Section and in Section V A 2 is that HLTC treatment
typically leads to improved outcomes, either by maximizing the total drug response time
for low PSAthr or by transforming the disease into a chronic condition for sufficiently high
PSAthr. This simple insight could serve as a valuable guide for enhancing current adap-
tive chemotherapy treatments. We suggest that clinicians might explore the possibility of
implementing HLTC, i.e. waiting for the disease to advance further rather than initiating
treatment too early. It is worth mentioning that this kind of “watchful waiting” approach
25
before treatment is not uncommon in practice [37], at least historically. Furthermore, even
without employing the “watchful waiting” approach (i.e., disregarding the high level compo-
nent of HLTC), maintaining the current method for determining the appropriate PSA level
for the initial drug treatment (that is, PSA↑) but implementing a tighter control, may also
change prostate cancer into a chronic disease for many patients (our simulation indicates
that, with this approach, 19 out of 32 patients could potentially become chronic).
VI.
DISCUSSION
Cancer has posed an immense challenge to modern medicine due to its complex nature
and the absence of a definitive cure [38], casting a shadow of devastation upon those affected.
This disease can wreak havoc on the human body, resulting in a multitude of severe impacts
before leading to the eventual demise. While prostate cancer treatments can prolong life-
expectancy, they can also be extremely aggressive and cause debilitating side effects [39].
Chemotherapy, a common treatment, frequently induces hair loss, nausea, and extreme
fatigue, significantly impacting not only the physical but also the emotional well-being of
patients [40].
It is crucial to understand that augmented drug administration does not
always result in an increased lifespan, even at the cost of more suffering. Paradoxically,
it appears plausible to significantly extend the patient life while concurrently reducing the
treatment ratio (the proportion of time a drug is given compared to the total treatment
duration) throughout the treatment course via adaptive chemotherapy [15]. In other words,
a longer and better life may be achievable.
In this work, we use a systematic statistical method, LBEB approach for NLME, to esti-
mate patient-informed parameters for a Stackelberg game-theoretic multi-population model
that quantitatively describes prostate cancer progression [17]. We obtain estimates for com-
mon parameters across all patients as well as the probability distribution for patient-specific
parameters in Section IV. We then employ a Bayesian Optimization approach to identify the
optimal adaptive chemotherapeutic treatment policy for a single drug (Abiraterone) aimed
at maximizing the time before the patient begins to show symptoms, under the assumption
that we know how advanced the cancer needs to be for symptoms to become manifest, in
Section V. We show that a high level tight control (HLTC) treatment, in which the trigger
signals (i.e., the biomarker levels) for drug administration and cessation are both high and
26
close together, typically yields the best outcomes, as demonstrated through both computer-
assisted and theoretical means (see Appendix B). Furthermore, we demonstrate that it may
be possible to transform prostate cancer from a terminal disease into a chronic condition for
most patients in Section V B.
Following this work, there are many directions for further exploration. First and foremost
is realizing the potential benefits of HLTC adaptive therapeutic treatments in laboratory
studies and clinical practice. Work along this direction is already in progress. On the nu-
merical investigation front, we have only optimize (via Bayesian Optimization) a very simple
treatment policy, in which there are only two states to be adjusted in drug administration:
either no drug or the maximum dosage rate. Allowing for more structured, possibly con-
tinuous in time – not just on/off – as proposed in [41], will provide a much richer protocol
space to optimize in, and hopefully, better solution to discover. Additional factors can also
be considered, such as the extreme toxicity of Docetaxel [15]. Too frequent dosages can be
intolerable to the patient’s body. Thus, for the treatment policy, limits should be imposed on
the administration of Docetaxel within a specific timeframe to ensure patient safety, which
is indeed often the case in clinical practices.
Better analysis on more realistic models of cancer could also lead to new insights and
novel discoveries regarding collective behavior emergence from population dynamics under
ever-changing conditions [42]. Stochastic therapies (in the spirit of the Kapitza stochastic
stabilization of the inverted pendulum [43, 44]) might prove more effective in targeting
cancerous cells compared to periodic ones (a phenomenon observed in a robotic model system
[45]). Importantly, we know that spatial dynamics are crucial in evolutionary systems [46].
Considering the metastatic nature of cancer cells, capturing how cells migrate (and also the
topology of the environment the cells live in [47, 48]) in the mathematical models should be
of critical importance as we strive for modeling fidelity.

Appendix B: An Analytical Justification for
the High Level Tight Control Paradigm
The clinician aims to manage cancer progression such that the observable PSA(t) remains
below a threshold PSAthr for as long as possible. This threshold corresponds to keeping the
total cancer cell population below xthr ≡PSAthr/PSAK. The total achievable time τtot until
this threshold is breached is the sum of three contributions (see Fig. 9):
τtot = τstart + ∆τ + τcont ,
(B1)
in which we have:
• τstart: The time from when the patient begins care with the clinician (at t = 0) until

cancer progression within a tumor, with green circles representing sensitive cells and red circles indicating

three distinct phases until the threshold is surpassed.
the adaptive chemotherapy starts. During this period, the growth of sensitive cells is
predominantly observed.
• ∆τ: The drug response time, from when the treatment starts to when it cannot
suppress the growth of cancer cells. During this time, the composition of the can-
cer population shifts from being predominantly sensitive cells to being dominated by
resistant cells.
• τcont: The time from when the treatment fails to when the PSA threshold is breached.
During this period, the patient is usually maintained on continuous Abiraterone treat-
ment to prevent any potential regrowth of sensitive cells. Consequently, the growth of
resistant cells is predominantly observed.
For a drug treatment cycle, we define the treatment ratio ρ as the fraction of the time
period during that cycle in which the drug Abiraterone is administered to the patient. In
other words, if the total time period of the treatment cycle is T and the on-drug time period
is ∆T, then ρ ≡∆T/T (see Fig. 9).

1.
Assumptions and Approximations
To quantitatively understand why HLTC can typically maximize the total achievable
time (and also reduce the average Abiraterone intake rate), let us investigate adaptive
chemotherapy for prostate cancer in a simple regime to obtain some concrete analytical
estimation. We assume that αRSxS(t) is much larger compared to xR(t) before Abiraterone
first administrated i.e. t ∈[0, τstart]. This condition holds true for most patients at t = 0 (as
shown in Fig. 4B) and therefore at later time, since the ratio xS(t)/xR(t) is always increase
with time. We can derive that from Eq. (4), as the growth of sensitive cells is always faster:
rS {1 −[xS(t) + xR(t)]} > rR {1 −[xR(t) + αRSxS(t)]} ,
(B2)
in which the ecological competition coefficient αRS ≈5.2 ≫1 and the growth rate ratio
β ≡rS/rR ≈3.0 (as estimated in Section IV C). We also assume that PSAthr is much smaller
than PSAK, which remains reasonable even when even when PSAthr <∼PSAK/αRS. Denote
the cancer cell population when the biomarker reaches the on-level to be x↑≡PSA↑/PSAK,
then x↑≤xthr. We therefore have xS(t), xR(t), x↑≪1 during t ∈[0, τtot]; however, it is
important to note that αRSxS(t) does not necessarily have to be negligible. These above
assumptions allow us to approximate Eq. (4) for t ∈[0, τstart] as:
d
dtxS(t) ≈rSxS(t) ,
d
dtxR(t) ≈rR [1 −αRSxS(t)] xR(t) .
(B3)
These ODEs can be solved analytically for xS(t) and xR(t), given the initial values xS(0)
and xR(0):
xS(t) = xS(0) exp (rSt) , xR(t) = xR(0) exp (rRt) exp

(B4)
To obtain τstart, we have to solve:
xS(τstart) + xR(τstart) = x↑,
(B5)
which is not analytically solvable in a general case. Let us further assume that the number of
sensitive cancer cells dominates when the drug treatment begins i.e. xS(τstart) ≫xR(τstart),
so that xS(τstart) ≈x↑. We can then obtain a simple approximation for τstart:
τstart ≈ln

If the initial total cancer cell population is small x(0) ≪x↑, then even with xS(0) ∼xR(0),
the condition xS(τstart) ∼x↑≫xR(τstart) will still hold. Another way for this condition to
arise is if the sensitive cell population initially dominates, meaning xS(0) ≫xR(0).
We study an adaptive therapy operates between the biomarker levels PSA↑and PSA↓=
(1 −ϵ)PSA↑. This means the total cancer cell population x(t) is is maintained between x↑
and x↑(1 −ϵ). Note that from Eq. (8), we can relate this control window parameter with
the off-drug policy parameter via ϵ = 1 −η↓. For a tight control ϵ ≪1, we can assume that
during the adaptive treatment time period t ∈[τstart, τexit] (where τexit ≡τstart + ∆t), the
cancer population is, on average, stabilized at:
x(t) ≈x↑

This assumption only holds when ⟨dx/dt⟩= 0 is possible, where ⟨◦⟩denotes the average
of a quantity ◦over time during a drug treatment cycle. Since the number of cells always
increase during the off-drug time period, we need to have during the on-drug the following
inequality:
d
dtxS(t)

Λ(t)=1 + d
dtxR(t) ≤0 .
(B9)
We use Eq. (4) to rewrite this as:

For most patients, γ →1 (see Fig. 4A and Fig. 8C). Together with Eq. (B8) and the

The right hand side is a finite positive value very close to 0, which is also increasing with
ϵ. This means that the tighter the control (i.e. the smaller the control window), the more
difficult it becomes to maintain stabilization Eq. (B8), as it reduces the allowable range

for xS. Therefore, when the adaptive treatment starts failing to suppress the cancer growth
(i.e. the inequality does not hold anymore), we can make the following approximation:

2
 .
(B23)
This implies the tightest control window ϵ (thus the maximum policy parameter η↓) will
give the smallest treatment ratio ρ.
b.
The Total Achievable Time τtot
The total achievable time can be calculated from the sum of the times given in Eq. (B6),
Eq. (B16), and Eq. (B20); however, the resulting expression is quite complex. In the limit
of very small resistant cells in the beginning xR(0) →0, the formula for τtot is simple and
can be splitted into two parts:
τtot = τ (c)
tot + τ (a)
tot .
(B24)
33
The part τ (c)
tot is equal to the total achievable time if a continuous drug treatment is applied
from the beginning, while τ (a)
tot represents the additional time gained by using an adaptive
chemotherapeutic treatment (for a given control window ϵ and on-drug level PSA↑) instead:

(B25)
Consider increasing the xthr but does not let it surpasses 1/αRS, then maximum time gained
corresponds to the tightest control (i.e. smallest possible ϵ) and the highest PSA on-drug
level below the threshold (i.e. largest allowable x↑):
max τ (a)
tot ≤τ (a)
tot (0, xthr) =

αRSxthr
1 −αRSxthr

τ (c)
tot .
(B26)
This description is that of the HLTC treatment. If we let xthr exceed 1/αRS, then max τ (a)
tot
can be infinitely large, indicating that the cancer disease can become chronic. Note that for
this to occur, the total number of cancer cells must be stabilized, as indicated in Eq. (B8).
This stabilization can fail if the population of sensitive cells is too low, as explained in Eq.
(B11).
We have made several assumptions and approximations to reach the conclusions outlined
above. While our findings may not be universally applicable, they can serve as a valuable
guide, as they agrees with the optimal treatment strategy for most cases (41 out of 43)
discussed in Appendix C.
Appendix C: Optimal Treatment Policy Report
We report the optimal adaptive therapy treatment policy parameters (η∗
↑, η∗
↓) found by
employing a Bayesian optimization approach, with different values of the PSA threshold
i.e.
PSAthr/PSAK = 0.14 in Table I and PSAthr/PSAK = 0.19 in Table II. After the
results found in Section V A 2, instead of select neval = 10 random points to evaluate at the
beginning, we do that for neval −2 = 8 and let the last two points to be (η↑, η↓) = (0.00, 0.00)
(representing a continuous treatment start at t = 0) and (η↑, η↓) = (0.90, 0.90) (representing
a HLTC treatment).
There is only one patient that has (η∗

↓) ̸= (0.90, 0.90) for both of these PSAthr/PSAK,
which is patient P1005. Upon closer examination, we find that this patient has very low drug
