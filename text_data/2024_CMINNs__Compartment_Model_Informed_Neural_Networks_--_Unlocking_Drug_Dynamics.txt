Abstract
In the field of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) modeling, which plays a pivotal role in
the drug development process, traditional models frequently encounter difficulties in fully encapsulating the
complexities of drug absorption, distribution, and their impact on targets. Although multi-compartment mod-
els are frequently utilized to elucidate intricate drug dynamics, they can also be overly complex. To generalize
modeling while maintaining simplicity, we propose an innovative approach that enhances PK and integrated
PK-PD modeling by incorporating fractional calculus or time-varying parameter(s), combined with constant
or piecewise constant parameters. These approaches effectively model anomalous diffusion, thereby capturing
drug trapping and escape rates in heterogeneous tissues, which is a prevalent phenomenon in drug dynamics.
Furthermore, this method provides insight into the dynamics of drug in cancer in multi-dose administrations.
Our methodology employs a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and fractional Physics-Informed Neu-
ral Networks (fPINNs), integrating ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with integer/fractional derivative
order from compartmental modeling with neural networks. This integration optimizes parameter estimation
for variables that are time-variant, constant, piecewise constant, or related to the fractional derivative order.
The results demonstrate that this methodology offers a robust framework that not only markedly enhances
the model’s depiction of drug absorption rates and distributed delayed responses but also unlocks different
drug-effect dynamics, providing new insights into absorption rates, anomalous diffusion, drug resistance,
peristance and pharmacokinetic tolerance, all within a system of just two (fractional) ODEs with explainable
results.

1. Introduction
Understanding the relationship between dose, concentration, and effect is a cornerstone of clinical pharma-
cology. This relationship is interpreted through pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) models.
The development of drugs relies on an iterative process of pharmacometric model-informed learning to op-
timize dosing for both safety and efficacy, spanning from preclinical studies to Phase III clinical trials [1].
Beyond the realm of drug development, PKPD principles are crucial for medication prescription and ad-
ministration.
These principles are particularly beneficial for determining off-label dosages, personalizing
treatments based on biomarkers, and adjusting doses to manage efficacy and toxicity concerns. In clinical
research, PKPD models are essential for ensuring optimal dosing and accurate power calculations, thereby
enhancing the design and outcomes of studies [2]. Pharmacometric modeling and simulation offer profound
insights into the dose–concentration–effect relationship. A population approach in pharmacometrics, employ-
ing mixed effects or multilevel modeling, is used to estimate parameter values while accounting for individual
variability [3].
This approach is applicable to both extensive and limited datasets, with optimal design
techniques enhancing data collection and precision [4]. Population pharmacometric models generate typical
population parameters and variances, which can facilitate new hypotheses and applications in personalized
medicine [5]. Utilizing PKPD model parameters as endpoints in clinical trials can improve study power and
efficiency. For example, viral kinetic models in hepatitis C have demonstrated increased power in detecting

differences in drug effects [6]. Investigator-led studies benefit from PKPD in designing dosing guidelines, as
shown by the use of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) in children with Crohn’s disease [7].
Compartment Models: Given the complexity of the human body, drug kinetics are often simplified by
representing the body as one or more tanks or compartments, which are reversibly interconnected. A com-
partment is considered a group of tissues with similar blood flow, but it is not an actual anatomical or
physiological region. Within each compartment, the drug is assumed to be uniformly distributed [8].
Non-Compartment Models: Non-compartmental analysis, also known as the model-independent ap-
proach, does not rely on the assumption of a specific compartmental model. Instead, it assumes that the
individual or organism can be represented as a single homogeneous compartment. This approach presumes
that the blood-plasma concentration of the drug accurately reflects its concentration in other tissues and
that drug elimination is directly proportional to its concentration in the individual or organism [3].
Fractional Calculus in Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Modeling: Diffusion plays a
crucial role in various transport processes within living organisms and significantly affects drug distribution in
the body. Key processes such as membrane permeation, solid dissolution, and dispersion in cellular matrices
are primarily driven by diffusion. Traditionally, diffusion is explained by Fick’s first law. However, recent ex-
perimental evidence has indicated that this conventional understanding does not always hold true. Instances
of diffusion that deviate from this norm have been observed, manifesting as either accelerated (super-diffusion)
or decelerated (sub-diffusion) relative to the standard case [9, 10]. In the context of pharmacokinetics, re-
sults in nonexponential tissue trapping and exponential washout curves characterized by a specific time
scale, typically referred to as a half-life [11]. These atypical diffusion patterns are termed anomalous, as they
deviate from the usual diffusion dynamics [9]. The concept of fractional kinetics was first introduced into
pharmaceutical literature by [12], with amiodarone being the initial drug demonstrating power-law kinetics
[13]. Following this, various other applications of fractional pharmacokinetics have emerged in the litera-
ture [14, 15]. There has been growing interest in using fractional calculus in pharmacokinetics, where the
Mittag-Leffler function offers an alternative to monoexponential models for representing single-compartment
kinetics after a bolus dose [16]. This approach was further expanded to commensurate two-compartment
models [5]. Additionally, [6] highlighted that sums of single- and two-parameter Mittag-Leffler functions can
represent the response functions for various, both commensurate and non-commensurate, compartmental
systems. These sums, combined with arbitrary inputs, can model a wide range of fractional pharmacoki-
netics scenarios. The work by [12] shifted focus towards pharmacodynamics, introducing a novel method
for pharmacodynamics modeling using fractional integrals and differential equations. Despite the increasing
number of applications of fractional order integrals and differential equations in fields such as physics, signal
processing, engineering, and bioengineering, they have received limited attention in pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics literature. One reason is the computational challenge: even though analytical solutions
to fractional differential equations are available in special cases, the simplest PKPD models constructed using
fractional calculus often do not permit analytical solutions [12]. Unlike systems defined by a single ordinary
differential equation (ODE), fractional multi-compartmental models cannot be simply created by changing
the order of the ordinary derivatives in the ODEs to fractional orders.
This simplistic modification can
result in inconsistent systems that violate mass balance. The authors of [4] present a rationale for the frac-
tionalization of ODEs, ensuring the creation of consistent systems that accommodate processes of different
fractional orders within the same model. Recently, new fractional PKPD models have been proposed and
compared with traditional integer-order models [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], highlighting the significance of
this approach in situations where the diffusion rate does not exhibit exponential decay or where the number
of parameters/compartments in the model is reduced.
Drug Resistance, Tolerance, and Persistence: Overcoming chemotherapy resistance, tolerance, and
persistence is critical for effective cancer treatment, as these mechanisms enable tumor cells to survive and
thrive even under intensive therapies. Resistance, typically driven by genetic mutations, allows cancer cells
to grow at high drug concentrations, while tolerance and persistence refer to the survival of cells under
transient or prolonged drug exposure without genetic changes. The ambiguity and overlap in the definition
of these terms complicates the interpretation of patient responses to treatment and underscores the need
for precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies [24, 25, 26].
Recent advances, such as the development
of computational models such as Re-sensitizing Drug Prediction (RSDP) and the exploration of adaptive
therapeutic strategies, highlight the importance of addressing both genetic and non-genetic factors in drug
resistance [27, 28, 29, 30]. The emergence of drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells, which are slow-growing and
2
metabolically distinct, further complicates treatment outcomes by acting as a reservoir for drug-resistant
mutations [31, 32, 33]. These DTP cells, originally identified in antibiotic-resistant bacterial biofilms, lack
underlying genomic alterations yet contribute significantly to treatment resistance in cancer [34]. Under-
standing the parallels between bacterial and cancer persisters, along with the role of tumor heterogeneity
and microenvironmental adaptations, is critical to developing more effective, personalized cancer therapies
that can overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes [35, 36, 37, 38, 26, 39, 40, 41, 42].
Physics-Informed Neural Networks:
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) [43] have revolu-
tionized parameter estimation, especially for systems with complex nonlinear dynamics, numerous unknown
parameters, and limited experimental data availability [44]. The advent of fractional PINNs (fPINNs) [45]
has broadened these techniques to encompass fractional differential equations, thereby broadening the scope
of modeling possibilities. The AI-Aristotle framework [46] introduced PINNs into pharmacokinetic models,
creating a benchmark for addressing complex inverse problems through these advanced models, and a recent
paper [47] used PINNs for learning chemotherapy drug action. In the present work, we extend signifucantly
this groundwork, by developing new PINN and fPINN models and applying them to diverse cases. This is
achieved by modifying the compartment model to fractional or time-varying parameter form, or by simpli-
fying the system to a system of two ODEs. This allows for enhanced precision and the generation of new
insights within PK and PD modelling.
Proposed Methodology: In pharmacokinetic modeling, we typically favor simpler models, largely due
to the fact that we usually have access only to data from the central compartment, namely plasma. Incor-
porating additional compartments complicates the model by increasing the number of parameters that need
to be inferred from the available data. This is particularly problematic in cases where the resulting system
is not structurally identifiable. Herein, we introduce two distinct approaches within the physics-informed
neural network framework. These methods either maintain the simplicity of the model or reduce the number
of compartments while still achieving a good fit to the data. Additionally, we offer new insights by presenting
the diffusion rate, rate of cell death, and drug efficacy index as parameters that change over time. This study
presents an innovative concept utilizing neural networks for compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) model-
ing, effectively identifying all necessary parameters even with limited and sparse datasets. We compare two
primary approaches across three distinct pharmacokinetic compartment models: a two-compartment model
with a single diffusion rate, a standard two-compartment model, and a three-compartment model. Each of
these models is applied to the pharmacokinetic analysis of separate drug concentration datasets. Addition-
ally, we introduce a fourth model that integrates pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, focusing on the
pharmacodynamic aspects to assess cancer drug resistance and drug tolerance in a multi-dose administration
regimen, while simplifying the model to a system of two ODEs.
A comprehensive illustration, presented in Figure 1, elucidates the architectural underpinnings of our
innovative approach to generalizing compartmental modeling. The following is a description of the organi-
zation of this paper: Section 2 is devoted to the presentation of the methodology employed in this study.
Here, we delineate our proposed generalized modeling approach and illustrate the use of physics-informed
neural networks for inferring model parameters from real data. Section 3 presents the four original PK and
PK-PD compartmental models selected for examination. It also describes the specific modifications each
model requires for simplification using our novel modeling approach. Section 4 presents the findings obtained
through the application of these two neural network-based solvers and the two novel modeling approaches.
Finally, section 5 provides a summary and a discussion of our findings and possible limitations.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Proposed Modeling Concept
In Pharmacokinetics modeling, "compartments" are abstract mathematical constructs designed to sim-
plify the representation of drug distribution within the human body. These compartments do not correspond
to specific anatomical or physiological spaces; rather, they serve as valuable tools for modeling the behavior of
substances introduced into the body [48]. Multi-compartment models enable the description of drug plasma
concentration as decaying in multiple exponential phases, thereby capturing the complexity of distribution
and elimination processes. The selection between compartmental and non-compartmental models is typi-
cally guided by the objectives of the analysis. Compartmental models are frequently employed to explore

Figure 1: CMINNs workflow. We consider two types of compartment models in pharmacology: pharmacokinetic models
and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. When the model is represented by a system of two ODEs, we apply the
PINNs/fPINNs framework to introduce additional flexibility in capturing complex dynamics. This enhances fitting accuracy,
particularly for models with reduced parameters or non-exponential decay dynamics, where traditional methods fail to achieve
satisfactory accuracy and insights. For multi-compartment models, the workflow proceeds to a compartment reduction step,
reformulating the model to optimize accuracy and provide deeper insights into drug dynamics. This allows for comparative
analysis of different drug behavior and ensures the best possible fit with a generalized model.
Pharmacokinetics variability across different populations or conditions, and to inform dosage adjustments
accordingly.
Compartmental models, being conceptual rather than physical constructs, require careful selection to
accurately represent the underlying data. The selection process is often guided by the number of exponential
terms identified in the logarithmic plots of concentration-time or effect-time profiles. However, determin-
ing the correct number of compartments can be particularly challenging, especially in cases of sparse data.
Sparse data, often resulting from infrequent sampling, can obscure the detection of distinct phases of drug
distribution and elimination. This may lead to an oversimplified interpretation, such as incorrectly classi-
fying a multi-compartment system as a single-compartment model. Additionally, non-linear kinetics, where
drug concentration over time deviates from a simple exponential decay, further complicates the analysis
of logarithmic plots and the accurate determination of the number of compartments [49]. Moreover, most
Pharmacokinetics data are derived from the central compartment (e.g., plasma), which can lead to param-
eter identifiability issues as the number of compartments increases. Adding more compartments raises the
risk of different parameter sets producing similar fits to the data, complicating the identification of unique
parameter values. High variability or noise in the data can also obscure the distinct phases, contributing
to potential misidentification of compartments. Other complicating factors include the complexity of drug
behavior, such as the overlapping distribution and elimination phases. In such cases, traditional models may
prove inadequate, necessitating the adoption of more sophisticated approaches or the inclusion of additional
compartments. The assumptions that underpin compartmental models, such as the homogeneity of compart-
ments, may not be universally applicable, thereby further complicating the process of identifying the relevant
compartments.
4
In light of these challenges, we investigate how distinct drugs can manifest disparate Pharmacokinetics
profiles while being modeled using a unified two-compartment framework, irrespective of whether conventional
modeling methodologies categorize them as one-compartment, two-compartment, or multi-compartment sys-
tems. In particular, our objective is to ascertain how discrepancies in drug absorption rates can be identified
when they are described by the same system of two ODEs. The objective of this study is to develop a gener-
alized model and apply it to various Pharmacokinetics phenomena with the aim of challenging and revising
the traditional modeling paradigm. We propose that all multi-compartment Pharmacokinetics models can
be simplified into two compartments through one of two modifications: either by incorporating drug trap-
ping phenomena using fractional derivative models or by considering the absorption rate as time-varying.
These approaches have the potential to generalize modeling methodologies and provide novel insights into
variations in absorption rates or memory effects across different drugs’ concentration-time profiles. The key
parameters driving changes in the slope of the curve are the absorption rate and the fractional derivative
order, allowing for different exponential decay behaviors to reflect either time-varying parameters or drug
trapping phenomena across various models and drugs.
In a PK-PD model, incorporating time-varying parameters provides valuable insights into phenomena
such as drug tolerance, chemotherapy resistance, and persistence in the use of anticancer agents. The present
study explores these concepts by analyzing the dynamics of these parameters over time, offering a deeper
understanding of their impact on drug efficacy. These techniques enable the creation of simpler models while
preserving the flexibility needed to accurately describe the various phases of drug concentration decay and
efficacy over time.
2.2. Methodology
Improving the accuracy of parameter estimation in PK/PK-PD modeling and uncovering new insights in
systems described by ordinary differential equations calls for a method that can (i) account for time-varying
parameters to more effectively model drug absorption dynamics in PK frameworks and drug effects in PK-
PD models, thereby facilitating the simulation of drug tolerance and cancer drug resistance, and (ii) utilize
fractional calculus to represent distributed and delayed drug responses in PK models or cancer cell death
dynamics in integrated PK-PD models. To achieve these goals, we implement Physics-Informed Neural Net-
works (PINNs), a widely acknowledged approach in scientific machine learning, to address both forward and
inverse problems linked to differential equations. Through the use of a deep fully connected neural network
and physics-informed loss functions, we can tackle the inverse problem in our novel modeling approach, which
integrates time-varying, constant, piecewise constant, and fractional components. For handling fractional-
order differential equations, we employ fPINNs, a variation of PINNs specifically designed for such equations.
The specifics of these methods are detailed in the following methodology subsections.
2.3. PINNs with Time-varying parameters
Building upon the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we propose a deep learning
framework that incorporates the differential equations governing compartmental Pharmacokinetics and Phar-
macodynamics models. In this framework, a neural network parameterized by θ takes time t as input and
produces an output vector representing the state variables ˆu(t; θ) = (ˆu1(t; θ), ˆu2(t; θ)), which approximates
the solution to the ordinary differential equations u(t).
To solve the inverse problem, where both time-
varying and potentially constant or piecewise constant parameters are unknown, we extend the framework
by introducing an additional output that approximates the time-dependent unknown parameter.
The architecture of the PINNs is depicted in Figure 2. A key step in this process is constraining the neural
network to satisfy both the observed data points of u(t) and the system of ODEs. This is accomplished by
constructing a loss function that incorporates terms corresponding to both the observational data and the
compartmental model. Specifically, let us assume we have measurements udata = {u1, u2, . . . , uM} at various
time points t1, t2, . . . , tM.
The neural network must satisfy the ODE system at specific time instances
t1, t2, . . . , tN, where these time points may be non-uniform and can be selected arbitrarily. Here, N represents
the number of collocation points, and M represents the number of data points.
For computing the total loss, we utilize the Self-Adaptive Loss Balanced method [50, 51]. The total loss
function is defined as a function of θ, p, λode, where p denotes the unknown parameters of the ODEs, and
λode is a vector representing the individual loss weights for the state variables, i.e., λode = (λ1, λ2). We note
that λdata and λIC are constant values, set to 0 during the first stage of training and 1 in the second stage
of training, and are not trainable variables in our neural network. The total loss is computed as follows:
5
L(θ, p, λode) = λICLIC(θ) + λdataLdata(θ) + λodeLode(θ, p),

(4)
We note that both the loss function derived from the data, denoted by Ldata, and the loss function
derived from the initial condition, denoted by LIC, quantify the difference between the neural network
outputs and the observed data. As a result, they can be categorised as supervised loss functions. On the
other hand, Lode, which is derived from the underlying ODE system, functions as an unsupervised loss. In
the final optimization stage, we jointly estimate the neural network parameters, θ∗, along with the unknown
ODE parameters, p∗, where p∗represents constant or piecewise constant parameters, and k(tn; θ) represents
time-varying parameters, by minimizing the overall loss function. This is achieved through gradient-based
optimization techniques, such as the Adam optimizer [52]. Moreover, the vector λ∗
ode is obtained by adjusting
the adaptive weights during each epoch, according to:
θ∗, p∗, λ∗
ode = arg max
λode min
θ,p L(θ, p, λode).
(5)
This represents a min-max optimization problem where we aim to minimize the loss by updating the
compartment model and neural network parameters, while simultaneously maximizing the weight associated
with the physics-based loss. For the training process, where our goal is to simultaneously predict the un-
known function k(t; θ) and estimate the constant parameter values, we use the Adam optimizer with default
hyperparameters and a different learning rate. Training is conducted either on the entire time domain for
PK models or on sequential intervals for PD model. Since our total loss comprises two supervised losses and
one unsupervised loss, we adopt a two-stage training strategy for PK compartment models as follows:
1. We have observed that supervised training typically yields a faster convergence than unsupervised
training. Consequently, the network is initially trained using the two supervised losses, namely, the
data loss function, denoted as Ldata, and the initial condition loss function, denoted as LIC. This is
done for a specified number of iterations. This preliminary training phase allows the network to rapidly
align itself with the observed data points.
2. Subsequently, the training process is continued, with all three losses being incorporated.
Empirical observations demonstrate that this two-stage training approach expedites network convergence
[46]. By initially warming up the neural network with parameters that produce an output fitted to the data,
we start the full training with a significantly smaller loss, which accelerates convergence. We did not use this
method for the PD model because it is trained in sequential intervals. In each interval, we may not have
any data, so the first stage is unnecessary for this type of training. Another significant point is that in the
time-domain decomposition method, we observe the data over the entire time range, and only the training
on the physics law is done in sequential intervals. This allows us to add an additional equation to further
constrain the physics component, which we will explain in the next section. The specific PINNs parameter
setup for each model is detailed in Table 1.
When applying PINNs to compartmental models, several challenges arise. One significant issue is the
minimal changes in drug concentration for certain drugs, such as amiodarone, which cause the neural net-
work’s output to rapidly approach zero. To address this, we propose adding a feature layer with exponential
terms. Another challenge is the typically large time range, as we often examine the effect or concentration
over extended periods. This necessitates the inclusion of auxiliary layers in the PINNs to normalize or scale
the inputs, bringing all values to the same order of magnitude, as demonstrated in Figure 2. Here, we added
6
an input scaling layer and normalized all equations to the range [0,1] to ensure the outputs are within the
same range as the scaled inputs.
For PK-PD models, we encounter additional challenges due to the presence of short-term spikes in the
PD models, resulting from repeated drug administration. These spikes can cause the PD model solutions
to exhibit multiple peaks. A primary challenge is the issue of catastrophic forgetting in the neural network
when trained over large time ranges, leading to a failure to capture one or more peaks and sudden spikes in a
multi-dose administration schedule. To mitigate this, we propose a sequential learning approach for PINNs,
where the model is trained over smaller time intervals, with a focus on expected spike times corresponding to
the drug administration schedule. This method offers two key benefits: first, it helps overcome the problem
of catastrophic forgetting; second, it allows us to infer the value of constant parameters, such as the index
of drug efficacy, within each interval. By treating these parameters as piecewise constants, we can observe
how they change following multi-dose drug administration, a topic we will explore further in the discussion
of the fourth model.

layer that normalizes all values to the order of 1. If the model is complicated we use the feature layer to add exponential terms
within the neural networks. Then, as the output of neural network model we obtain the solution of the system of ODEs along
with the time-varying parameter(s). The output goes to an optimization block where it minimizes the physical loss as well as
the data loss and updates the neural network parameters. We employ adaptive weights for the physics loss, where the
coefficient λode is updated simultaneously with the neural network parameters θ and the compartment model’s constant
parameters p.
2.4. fPINNs
Fractional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (fPINNs) are an extension of PINNs, specifically designed
to address both fractional partial and ordinary differential equations. Herein, we construct fractional PK
and PK-PD models of the same type with different manifestations by adopting various modeling approaches.
Subsequently, we obtain the parameters of the fractional models by solving the inverse problem using the
fPINNs algorithm across the different modeling approaches and compare the results with those obtained
using other proposed methods. This holistic approach enables us to to select the most suitable fractional
model, which is representative of the anomalous diffusion and absorption laws of the drug concentration.
One of the key features of fractional models is their non-local or memory property, which distinguishes
them from integer-order differential operators. This property implies that the future state of a model depends
not only on its current state but also on its entire history. For an in-depth exploration of the definitions and
theoretical foundations of fractional calculus, we refer the reader to [53, 54, 55]. In this work, we employ the
Caputo fractional derivative, which requires an initial condition involving the state variable.
Definition: The Caputo fractional derivative operator C
0Dα
x of order α is defined as:
C
0Dα
xf(x) =

0
f (m)(t)
(x −t)α−m+1 dt,
α > 0,
(6)
7
where m −1 < α ≤m, m ∈N, and x > 0.
The Caputo fractional derivative operator is a linear operation, analogous to the integer-order derivative:
C
0Dα
x (λf(x) + µg(x)) = λ C
0Dα
xf(x) + µ C
0Dα
xg(x),
(7)
where λ and µ are constant values. We note that the Caputo differential operator reduces to the classical
derivative when α is an integer. The initial conditions for fractional differential equations using the Caputo
derivative are analogous to those for integer-order differential equations, making this definition particularly
suitable for modeling a wide range of physical processes.
It is well known that in machine learning, the design of the loss function and the order of computation
are crucial for optimizing neural networks. In the context of parameter estimation in fPINNs, fitting the
actual data should take precedence over fitting the mathematical model constructed under ideal conditions.
Therefore, we restructured the iterative fitting process of the fPINN method into a two-stage training process.
Initially, the loss function is configured to include only the label penalty term for the real data, i.e., the
supervised losses. Once the model accurately fits the data, the equation penalty term (unsupervised loss) is
introduced into the loss function with a smaller penalty weight(1e−4). The non-local nature of the fractional
derivative operators in Equation (6) introduces significant challenges in solving it. The LIC and Ldata will
be computed in the same way as in the PINNs method, while we have a different formula for Lode, where we
use the Caputo derivative definition instead of the integer-order derivative of the equation, as follows:

Typically, approximating fractional derivative operators involves a discrete convolution form (see, e.g., [56,
57, 58, 59, 60]) for 0 ≤j ≤n, where 0 < n ≤K. The fractional derivative can be expressed as:

ω(α)
n−j(uj −u0)
(9)
where τ is the time step size, K is defined as K = T
τ , and ω(α)
n−j are the convolution quadrature weights.
Implementing this convolution directly requires O(K) active memory and O(K2) arithmetic operations,
making the computation quite expensive.
To reduce the memory requirements and computational costs
associated with the discrete convolution used for approximating fractional derivatives, several methods have
been proposed [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66].
In general, fractional differential operators are often discretized
using numerical methods such as the finite difference method (FDM), finite element method (FEM), or
spectral method (SM). In this paper, we employ the second-order fractional backward differentiation formula
(FBDF) algorithm [67] within the FDM framework. In the second-order FBDF Extended scalar auxiliary
variable(SAV) Method Preserving Energy Dissipation, the time interval [0, T] can be divided into K equal
subintervals with a time-step size τ = T
K . Let tn = nτ and un = u(x, tn) for 0 ≤n ≤K. We use the following
notations:

use the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and FBDF for discretization of fractional order derivative to compute numerical
solutions. In this model, the neural network output is passed to the AD block for integer-order derivative computation and to
the FDM block for fractional-order differentiation. The computed derivatives are then incorporated into the equation to
calculate the physics loss and simultaneously update the fractional compartment model’s constant parameters p and α, along
with the neural network parameters θ.
3. Mathematical Models
In this section, we present four mathematical models, three of which are focused on pharmacokinetics for
three distinct drugs. These models detail the dynamics of drug concentration in the blood. The fourth model
combines pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with an emphasis on the pharmacodynamic aspects. A
pharmacokinetic model typically quantifies the changes in drug concentration in the bloodstream over time,
whereas a pharmacodynamics model focuses on the relationship between drug concentration at the site of
action and the resultant biological effect. These models are meticulously crafted to capture the dynamic
interactions within specific biological processes, such as drug absorption.
They provide a physics-based
understanding of the behavior and characteristics of the systems under examination. This approach enables
a more detailed simulation of the drug’s behavior within the body, thereby facilitating the development of
personalized treatment strategies based on the dynamic responses observed.
3.1. Model 1: Two-Compartment Pharmacokinetic Model for Gentamicin
Managing chronic wounds is a significant area of focus in medical and biomaterials research, especially
given the rising concerns related to multi-drug resistant microbes and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. To tackle
these issues, a poly(vinyl alcohol)/gentamicin (PVA/Gent) hydrogel has been developed for wound treatment.
This hydrogel is designed to deliver gentamicin locally over an extended period, eliminating the need for
systemic drug administration.
A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model is utilized to represent the release of gentamicin from the
PVA/Gent hydrogel, which is specifically aimed at wound dressings for treating severe chronic wounds. This
model omits an elimination rate because the drug is not present in the bloodstream where it would be
cleared. The model is based on the data described in [68], which outlines the preparation and analysis of
the hydrogel system. The PVA/Gent hydrogel was created by physically cross-linking a poly(vinyl alcohol)
solution using a freeze-thaw method, followed by soaking in a gentamicin solution at 37°C for 48 hours. The
amount of gentamicin released was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography combined with
mass spectrometry. This methodology addresses the challenge of controlling gentamicin release from the
hydrogel, which is crucial for effective chronic wound care and healing.

Considering the classical two-compartment pharmacokinetic model, the equations governing the system
are as follows:
dA1

= −k
V1
A1(t) + k
V2
A2(t) + f1(t),
dA2
dt
= k
V1
A1(t) −k
V2
A2(t),
(14)
where Ai (i = 1, 2) represents the mass of gentamicin in compartments 1 and 2, respectively, and Vi (i =
1, 2) denotes the volume of these compartments. Based on previous findings, we set V1 = 254.5 mm3 and
V2 = 1000 mm3. Additionally, f1 represents the supply of drug to compartment 1. The dimensions of k is
[mm3/day].
We adapt this model according to the CMINNs modeling approach as follows:
1. When utilizing PINNs, the constant value k must be modified to be a time-dependent function. Con-
sequently, the equations are rewritten as:
dA1(t)
dt
= −k(t)
A1(t)

+ f1(t),
dA2(t)
dt

A1(t)

.
(15)
2. In the context of fPINNs, it is necessary to introduce a fractional derivative into the model. Thus, the
system of ODEs defined in (14) is transformed into the following commensurate fractional PK model
of equal-order in the Caputo sense:
C
0 Dα
t A1 = −k
A1(t)

(16)
where C
0 Dα
t denotes the Caputo fractional derivative of order α. To satisfy mass conservation, the derivative
orders for both compartments must be equal. If they differ, the system becomes non-commensurate, leading
to significant issues. Non-commensurate systems exhibit properties that violate mass balance, particularly
concerning the consistency of rate units. For example, if the mass flux leaving one compartment is defined by
a non-integer order rate, it would enter another compartment with a different non-integer order rate, thereby
violating mass balance [4].
3.2. Model 2: Two-Compartment Pharmacokinetic Model for Amiodarone
The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug known for its non-exponential
pharmacokinetics and significant clinical implications due to drug accumulation during long-term adminis-
tration, have been analyzed using a general two-compartment model. The model was applied to a dataset
from intravenous administration studies on volunteer subjects given 400 mg doses. This dataset was initially
presented in [69].
The governing equations of this model are described by the following system of linear ordinary differential
equations:
dA1(t)
dt
= −k12A1(t) + k21A2(t) −k10A1(t) + I1(t),
dA2(t)
dt
= k12A1(t) −k21A2(t).
(17)
Here, A1(t) and A2(t) represent the mass or molar amounts of Amiodarone in the respective compart-
ments. The parameters kij govern the mass transfer between the compartments and the elimination from
each, where the notation k12 denotes the rate of transfer from compartment 1 to compartment 2, and k10
denotes elimination from compartment 1, and so forth. The units for all kij rate constants are (1/time). The
input rates I1(t) representing the drug dose and administration schedule and it may be zero, constant, or
time-dependent.
10
Amiodarone displays unusual pharmacokinetic characteristics that conventional models fail to adequately
capture. The long-term pharmacokinetics of this highly cationic amphiphilic drug presents challenges that
traditional pharmacokinetic concepts cannot address. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed CMINNs
model, we apply it to a scenario known for its anomalous pharmacokinetic behaviors. The model is reformu-
lated as follows:
1. Utilizing PINNs, we modify the absorption rate constant k12 to a time-dependent function k12(t),
which allows us to capture the natural fluctuations in the absorption rate, while keeping k21 and k10
as constant values:
dA1(t)
dt
= −k12(t)A1(t) + k21A2(t) −k10A1(t),
dA2(t)
dt
= k12(t)A1(t) −k21A2(t).
(18)
2. Based on the fractional model proposed in [4], which outlines a generalized approach for the fractional-
ization of compartmental models by mixing different fractional orders, we consider a two-compartment
fractional pharmacokinetic model. In this model, Compartment 1 (central) represents general circula-
tion and well-perfused tissues, while Compartment 2 (peripheral) corresponds to deeper tissues. The
system considers three transfer processes (fluxes): elimination from the central compartment and a
mass flux from the central to the peripheral compartment, both of which are assumed to follow classic
first-order kinetics. However, the flux from the peripheral to the central compartment is modeled with
slower fractional kinetics to account for tissue trapping.
This system is mathematically formulated as follows:
dA1(t)
dt
= −(k12(t) + k10)A1(t) + k21
C

3.3. Model 3: Three-Compartment Pharmacokinetics Model for Talaporfin Sodium
Talaporfin sodium (2.5 mg/kg) was intravenously administered to an adult male dog. The concentration
of talaporfin sodium in plasma was quantified using a spectrophotometer. Additionally, the fluorescence
of talaporfin sodium in skin and myocardium was measured in vivo with a specially developed system.
The skin fluorescence, excited by 409 ± 16 nm light to match the talaporfin sodium Soret band, and the
myocardial fluorescence, excited by 663 ± 2 nm light to match the talaporfin sodium Q band, were both
quantified using a spectrometer. We use the data and the model described in [70] in our study. This model
estimates the interstitial concentration of talaporfin sodium based on changes in plasma concentration and
myocardial fluorescence, enhancing our understanding of its efficacy interstitial photodynamic therapy (PDT).
It also integrates differential rate equations across the plasma, interstitial space, and cellular compartments,
incorporating specific compartment volumes, concentrations, and rate constants.
The dynamics of talaporfin sodium across these compartments is governed by the following differential
rate equations:
V1
dC1
dt = −(k10 + k12)V1C1 + k21V2C2,
V2
dC2
dt = k12V1C1 −(k21 + k23)V2C2 + k32V3C3,
V3
dC3
dt = k23V2C2 −k32V3C3,
(20)
where Vi and Ci represent the volume and concentration in the ith compartment (i = 1, 2, 3), respectively. The
rate parameters k10, k12, k21, k23, k32 regulate the transfer of mass between compartments and the elimination
from each. The volumes [v1, v2, v3] are set to [394, 251, 970] mL, as determined by histological assessments
reported in [71].
According to the CMINNs workflow illustrated in Figure 1, we need to reduce the model to two compart-
ments. However, since this model includes data for all compartments—an uncommon feature in compart-
mental models—it is challenging to achieve a good fit with traditional methods. Therefore, our first step is to
11
rewrite the model using a time-varying absorption rate and fractional derivatives to enhance its flexibility in
capturing changes in the concentration-time profiles across all compartments. Thus, in 3.3.1, we reformulate
the three-compartment model, and in 3.3.2, we proceed to the compartment reduction block of CMINNs to
reformulate the PK model with two compartments.
3.3.1. Reformulation of the Three-Compartment Model with Time-Varying Absorption Rates and Fractional
Derivatives
To address the dynamic nature of drug absorption rates, we assume that k12, the primary rate constant,
is a function of time. Additionally, by incorporating fractional calculus, we aim to better capture the delay in
drug response. We will compare the results of two different methods for fractionalizing the model: applying
fractional derivatives either to the right-hand side or the left-hand side of the equations, as introduced in
Equations (16) and (19). Using PINNs with a time-varying absorption rate, in the three-compartment model,
we only need to replace k12 with k12(t), which is one of the outputs of our PINNs model. To change the model
to include fractional derivatives, there are two approaches explained in detail in reference [72]. The paper
presents the following two fractional models formulated from a classical pharmacokinetics compartmental
system: commensurable and implicit non-commensurable models.
a) The commensurate fractional three-compartment pharmacokinetic model is described by the following
set of fractional differential equations:
V1
C
0 Dα
t C1 = −(k10 + k12)V1C1 + k21V2C2,
V2
C
0 Dα
t C2 = k12V1C1 −(k21 + k23)V2C2 + k32V3C3,
V3
C
0 Dα
t C3 = k23V2C2 −k32V3C3.
(21)
b) The non-commensurate fractional three-compartment PK model introduces a different fractional order
in one of the compartments. The governing equations are written as follows:
V1
dC1
dt = −(k10 + k12)V1C1 + k21V2C2,
V2
dC2
dt = k12V1C1 −(k21 + k23)V2C2 + k32V3

t
C3,
V3
dC3
dt = k23V2C2 −k32V3

(22)
We need to infer the fractional order α along with the constant values of the unknown parameters k10,
k12, k21, k23, and k32.
3.3.2. Reduction of the Three-Compartment Model to a Two-Compartment Model Using CMINNs
In this section, we reformulate the Three-Compartment Model to a Two-Compartment Model with a
time-varying absorption rate and fractional order derivative as follows:
1. Generalized model with time-dependent parameter:
V1
dC1
dt = −(k10 + k12(t))V1C1 + k21V2C2,
V2
dC2
dt = k12(t)V1C1 −k21V2C2.
(23)
2. Fractional generalized model:

Model 4: Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Model for Tumor Growth and Treatment in Animal
A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model was developed to simplify the complex behavior
of tumor growth, making it more suitable for use in preclinical oncology drug development [73]. This model,
described through a system of ODEs, connects the dosage of a drug to tumor growth patterns observed in
animal experiments. It separates the tumor growth dynamics into two categories: untreated and treated
groups. Tumors in the untreated group initially follow an exponential growth phase, which transitions into
a linear phase. In contrast, in the treated group, the tumor growth rate is smaller in relation to both the
drug concentration and the number of actively proliferating tumor cells. The differential equation governing
the unperturbed tumor growth w(t) is given by:
dw(t)
dt
=
λ0 · w(t)
[1 +

λ0
λ1 · w(t)
Ψ
]1/Ψ
, w(0) = w0.
(25)
When Ψ becomes large enough, Equation (25) accurately models the transition in tumor growth dynamics.
In particular, for tumor mass w(t) below a critical threshold wth, the term λ0
λ1 · w(t) in the denominator is
small compared to 1, resulting in a growth rate primarily dominated by λ0 · w(t), representing exponential
growth. On the other hand, when w(t) surpasses wth, the 1 in the denominator becomes negligible, shifting
the growth rate to a linear behavior driven by λ1. In practice, setting Ψ to 20 or higher ensures a distinct
transition from exponential (first-order) to linear (zero-order) growth, effectively replicating the sharp change
seen in the original switching systems-based model.
This model introduces an innovative transit compartment system to simulate the delayed cell death
processes often seen in signal transduction pathways. The pharmacodynamic parameters in the model are
closely tied to the kinetics of tumor cell death, the potency of anticancer drugs, and the characteristics of
tumor growth. These connections allow for an in-depth comparison of drug efficacy and provide insight into
variations in tumor cell death processes.
This comprehensive model is articulated through the following system of differential equations:
dx1(t)
dt
=
λ0 · x1(t)
[1 +

λ0
λ1 · w(t)
Ψ
]1/Ψ
−k2 · c(t) · x1(t),
dx2(t)
dt
= k2 · c(t) · x1(t) −k1 · x2(t),
dx3(t)
dt
= k1 · (x2(t) −x3(t)),
dx4(t)
dt
= k1 · (x3(t) −x4(t)),
w(t) = x1(t) + x2(t) + x3(t) + x4(t).
(26)
In this model, x1(t) represents the fraction of proliferating cells, while x2(t) through x4(t) correspond to
cells at different stages of damage leading to cell death. The total tumor mass, w(t), accounts for all these
cellular compartments, and c(t) represents the plasma concentration of the anticancer drug. We note that
while the drug’s effect on tumor growth curves typically begins quickly, the observable impact often persists
even after drug concentrations become negligible. This is because the rate-limiting step may lie in the kinetics
of the transit compartment model. From the moment of inoculation (time zero) until when drug exposure be-
gins, the tumor experiences unperturbed growth. During this period, c(t) = 0 and x2(t) = x3(t) = x4(t) = 0,
meaning the total tumor mass w(t) is equal to x1(t).
The drug concentration c(t) is derived from a two-compartment model with predefined parameters,
based on the data provided in [73], which was utilized in this study. The governing equations of the two-
13
compartment PK model are described by the following system of linear ODEs:
dA1(t)
dt
= −k12A1(t) + k21A2(t) −k10A1(t) + I1(t),
dA2(t)
dt
= k12A1(t) −k21A2(t),
c(t) = A1(t)
V1
.
(27)
For the concentration of the drug in the PD model, we need to divide A1(t) by V1, which is the volume of
distribution in the first compartment. The PK parameters determined after the intravenous administration
of paclitaxel are as follows: V1 = 0.81, L/kg, k10 = 0.868, h−1, k12 = 0.0060, h−1, and k21 = 0.0838, h−1. The
administered dose is 30 mg/kg. The treatment starts on day 13, with a 3-dose regimen where 30 mg/kg is
administered every 4 days.
Based on the CMINNs method, we generalized the system of four ODEs to a reduced compartment model
with two ODEs by employing the compartment reduction block. This allows for finer control over the number
of compartments while accurately modeling the delay by estimating the appropriate fractional order or
inferring time-varying or piecewise constant value parameters. Further analysis is needed to determine which
parameters should be treated as functions of time, constants, or piecewise constants. Figure 4 illustrates the
effect-time profile of paclitaxel with varying parameter values in the proposed model. Parameter k1 represents
the rate of cell death, which varies over time due to the delay in cell death following drug administration. In
contrast, k2 serves as a measure of drug potency, reflecting the efficacy of the drug against the tumor. The
figure shows that as the drug efficacy index k2 increases, the treatment becomes more effective, leading to
a further decrease in tumor weight. In contrast, changes in k1 produce only slight variations in the curve’s
shape and the steady-state slope. Therefore, it is not necessary to model this parameter as time-dependent,
as significant changes in k1 have only a minor effect on the function’s output.

ml · ng−1 · day−1, while in the bottom panel, k1 is set to 1 day−1. The figure highlights the pharmacodynamic model’s
behavior following a single drug dose administered on day 13. Parameter k1 represents the rate of drug-induced cell death. In
contrast, k2 quantifies drug potency, indicating how effectively the drug inhibits tumor growth. The figure reveals that
increasing k2 enhances treatment efficacy, resulting in a greater reduction in tumor size. In contrast, variations in k1 yield only
minor changes in the curve’s overall shape and final slope.
Following the generalized modeling approach of CMINNs, we reduced the number of compartments in
both physics-based models and applied the methods starting from the first drug administration. This decision
14
is based on the observation that, in the absence of treatment, the model follows unperturbed tumor growth
dynamics Eq.(25).
Once treatment begins, these dynamics change.
Therefore, it is logical to focus on
persistence, resistance, tolerance, and delayed responses in cell death following the first drug exposure and
solve the inverse problem for the system within the time range [13,32]. We modify the model as follows:
1. In PINNs, due to the tolerance development of the multi-dose anti-cancer agent and the different
behavior of cancer cells after repeated doses, we have designated k2 as a piecewise constant parameter.
This parameter will be recalculated from one administered dose to the next, allowing it to change after
the second and third administrations. Meanwhile, k1 is treated as a time-dependent function to better
capture the dynamics of cell death. We reformulated the pharmacodynamic model as follows:

(28)
where w(t) = x1(t)+x2(t) and ti denotes the i-th time of administration, with i = 1, 2, 3 for a three-dose
administration regimen, and tf represents the final value in the time range over which the equation is
solved. The parameter k2,i is a constant value of the piecewise constant parameter k2 between the i-th
and (i + 1)-th administrations. The functions c(ti,ti+1)(t) and x1(ti,ti+1)(t) represent the parts of the
function within the interval between ti and ti+1.
2. For fPINNs, to capture the memory effect and delayed response in cell death under a multi-dose
treatment schedule, we fractionalized the PKPD equation (26) following our CMINNs method and
the approach outlined by [74].
This method provides a more detailed description of the delay in
drug response by incorporating fractional derivatives into the model. According to the paper, cellular
response to drug administration is often delayed due to the age distribution of individual cells within
a population.
While transit compartment models (TCMs) are traditionally used to represent this
delay, the proposed method introduces a single fractional derivative equation to model drug-induced
damage, combining fractional and ordinary derivatives into one equation instead of using a system
of ODEs across multiple compartments. A theorem that establishes rigorously such equivalence and
corresponding theoretical foundations for this approach are detailed in [74]. The reduced fractionalized
model is given by:
dx1(t)

(29)
where w(t) = x1(t) + x2(t). The parameters λ0, λ1, and Ψ represent tumor growth dynamics inferred
from control data, while k2, τ, and α describe drug efficacy, the memory effect, and the delayed response
in cell death following a multi-dose administration regimen. In this study, we set τ = 1, consistent
with the value of k1 reported in [73]. With this setting, we only need to infer the values of k2 and α as
model parameters using fPINNs.

4. Results
In this section, we present the results in tables that summarize the average inferred constant parameter
values obtained after running the model five times with different random seeds for initialization of neural
networks parameters. Alongside these averages, we report the standard deviations across the five runs. The
corresponding ODE solutions, using the average inferred parameters, are illustrated in the figures. Although
the neural network outputs provide the best-fit results—since minimizing data loss is its primary objective,
standard numerical methods were employed to validate the results obtained from solving the inverse problem
by CMINNs method.
This validation step is crucial in solving inverse problem by physics-based neural
networks models because neural networks can achieve high data-fitting accuracy even when the inferred
parameters are not entirely accurate. By solving the forward problem with numerical methods, we assessed
the results using the inferred constant, piecewise constant, and time-varying parameters for the single-dose
PK models (Models 1, 2, and 3) and the PD model (Model 4). For integer-order models, we used the odeint
function from the scipy.integrate library, which utilizes the LSODA algorithm.
LSODA dynamically
switches between non-stiff and stiff solvers; for non-stiff problems, it applies the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton
method (a multi-step approach), while for stiff problems, it employs the Backward Differentiation Formula
(BDF), an implicit method. For simulating the PK model in Model 4, which involves a multi-dose drug
administration regimen, we applied the explicit Euler forward method. For fPINNs, where we incorporate
fractional-order derivatives, we used the FBDF method to compute the fractional derivatives within the
explicit Euler forward method for solving the forward problem. The setup of model parameters for PINNs
and fPINNs is reported in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Both methods demonstrate that Model 2 and
Model 4 present significant challenges for the PINNs and fPINNs approaches due to sparse data and abrupt
changes in Model 2, and occasional spikes of drug administration in Model 4. To improve convergence and
avoid local minima, we utilized a feature layer in both methods. For Model 2, we incorporated additional
collocation points Node in PINNs and added discretization points NF BDF for fractional derivatives. These
enhancements increased the influence of the physics loss and allowed for a more accurate computation of the
memory effect in areas with limited data, respectively.

4.1. Model 1
In this model, we have only a single diffusion rate to explain the movement of mass to the second
compartment and its subsequent return. The traditional method, with a constant value of k in Eq. 14,
16
is unable to capture the data. The application of a single diffusion rate is inadequate for explaining the
observed phenomena. Therefore, we utilize the CMINNs method to enhance the flexibility of the system
and demonstrate how it transforms the compartmental modeling paradigm. This approach provides superior
accuracy without the need for complex fractional mathematical models or the introduction of additional
parameters to the model for more precise approximation of the experimental data.
Miskovic et al.
[68] proposed a general fractional derivative of distributed order, which requires the
addition of six parameters to the model. In contrast, we utilize the Caputo derivative to model the same
phenomenon with the addition of a single parameter (fractional derivative order α), and the degree of
alignment between the results of these two approaches is demonstrated in Figure 5. The final outputs of the
PINNs method exhibit a smoother solution and offer new insights into the diffusion rate as a function. The
model was run five times with different random seeds for the initialization of the neural network parameters,
and the average of the inferred function, k(t), was plotted. The light blue shading represents the standard
deviation, while the blue line shows the mean value of k(t)).
As the model does not include additional
parameters influenced by the varying values of k(t), the standard deviation is small, as reflected by the
narrow light blue region. This indicates the robustness of our PINNs with time-varying parameter modeling.
The mean and standard deviation of the fPINNs parameters are presented in Table 3. In Figure 5, the k(t)
function starts at approximately 0.050 mm3/day at time t = 0. As k(t) increases, it reflects the acceleration
of mass movement between the two compartments, with faster dynamics at the beginning. The subsequent
decrease in k(t) after 2 days indicates slower mass transfer. Around day 2.5, k(t) stabilizes at a constant
value of k(t) = 0. This is also observed in the concentration plots for the two compartments, which depict
the same phenomenon: the mass in both compartments has reached equilibrium, and no further movement
between compartments occurs.

4.2. Model 2
In the CMINNs method using PINNs, the sparsity of data leads to multiple solutions with varying time-
dependent functions for k12(t), accompanied by slight variations in the coupled diffusion rate k21 values. This
explains the larger standard deviations observed for the parameters k12(t) in Figure 6 and k21 in Table 4,
both of which characterize the diffusion rate between compartments 1 and 2. Although each individual run
produces slightly different results, incorporating these parameters into the numerical solver would yield a
more accurate fit. Nonetheless, we opted to use the mean values of these parameters for solving the forward
problem, while preserving the overall trend of the time-varying function rather than a specific function.
Similarly, for the fPINNs, we employed the mean values as well, since this model represents the same phe-
nomenon, and averaging was considered the most suitable approach to demonstrate robustness. The results
are presented in Figure 6 for the PINNs and Figure 7 for the fPINNs. The inferred parameter, denoted as
k12(t) , displays two distinct phases in its dynamics of absorption rate with the PINNs method. In the initial
phase, the slope is markedly steep, indicating a rapid decline in the absorption rate during the initial two
hours. Subsequently, as the drug accumulates in the plasma, the absorption rate increases suddenly, thereby
accelerating the mass transfer between the central compartment and other organs in the peripheral compart-
ment, leading to extensive tissue distribution. After a while, the drug concentration remains detectable in
the plasma and continues to be either eliminated or redistributed to other compartments. Consequently, the
absorption rate, represented by the parameter k12(t), reaches a steady-state value. At this stage,k12(t) is
equal to a constant value, reflecting a consistent absorption rate for the remaining drug in plasma.
Comparing our results to those in the literature for Amiodarone, which exhibits non-exponential decay,
the CMINNs approach demonstrated highly accurate results using an integer-order model. This outcome
underscores the effectiveness of PINNs with time-varying parameters in modeling drugs characterized by
anomalous decay behavior. Furthermore, Figure 6 demonstrates the close alignment of the data points on
a linear scale, which poses a significant challenge for many traditional methods relying on optimization
techniques to solve inverse problems. However, on a logarithmic scale, small discrepancies in plasma drug
concentration and model fitting errors become more apparent. This introduces an additional challenge for
physics-based neural network methods, which must balance minimizing data loss with maintaining adherence
to physical laws. These methods can sometimes converge to a local minimum, resulting in inaccurate inferred
parameters, even though the neural network output fits the data perfectly. To address this, we introduced a
feature layer as an auxiliary layer in the neural network to enhance the model. By incorporating parameters
governing exponential decay, we improved the performance of both PINNs and fPINNs. The results from the
fPINNs method demonstrate an even better fit, as it effectively captures the phenomenon of drug trapping and
memory effect, providing a more comprehensive explanation for this issue and incorporating non-exponential
decay phenomena.

4.3. Model 3
For the Talaporfin sodium drug, we consider two different modeling approaches:
i. The first approach retains the three-compartment model but introduces greater flexibility to the existing
model, allowing for a more accurate fit of the data across all compartments compared to traditional
methods.
ii. The second approach utilizes the CMINNs method, which reduces the model to a two-compartment
system and uses less data, considering only two compartments instead of three.
19
The results for approach (i) are presented in Figure 8, and the inferred parameter values are reported in
Table 5. We observe that, although the PINNs method allowed k12(t) to vary with time, it exhibits only
slight changes and consistently converges towards a nearly constant value. This observation validates our
novel modeling approach: by reducing the number of compartments and subsequently the number of param-
eters, we maintain good model performance with enhanced control over fewer parameters. The constancy of
k12(t) can be attributed to the fact that the three-compartment model adequately captures the slope changes
in the concentration-time profile. Furthermore, we observe a larger standard deviation in k21, indicating
variability in the diffusion rate between compartments 2 and 1. When the rate of mass entering the second
compartment increases, the rate at which it exits also increases. Despite these variations, the inferred pa-
rameter values are robust across all simulations and have comparably small standard deviation.We achieved
a better fit compared to previous work [70], and we evaluated the fitting quality using the R2 score. Our
CMINNs approach demonstrates a fitting accuracy exceeding 0.99 for each individual run. This high accu-
racy is achieved without relying on the mean value typically used for plotting results, thereby confirming its
superior performance. Additionally, we explore the impact of applying fractional derivatives to different sides
of the model equations. In Table 5, we observe that for compartments not involving fractional derivatives
(i.e., the third compartment) and the elimination rate k10, the parameter values remain consistent across all
models.

(a) and (b) represent commensurable and implicit non-commensurable fractional models, respectively. In (a), we employ a
fractional derivative on the left side of the equation, while in (b), we fractionalize the right-hand side of the equation. In the
PINNs method, we use a time-varying absorption rate k12(t), and as expected, the corresponding diffusion rate shows the
largest standard deviation compared to other parameters.
The results for approach (ii), the reduced two-compartment model, are presented in Figure 9.
As a
consequence of the reduction in the number of compartments, the value of k12(t) displays a recognisable
trend over time. The process begins at 3.3, initially showing a decline, as substances diffuse from areas of
higher to lower concentration, illustrating drug trapping in the peripheral compartment, which leads to a
decrease in the absorption rate. As the drug redistributes to other organs, the absorption rate subsequently
increases, eventually reaching a steady state that reflects a constant absorption rate. Our PINNs and fPINNs
models fit the data accurately, even when using the mean inferred parameter values. The inferred parameter
values are shown in Table 6. Since k12(t) shows significant variation across different runs, our elimination
rate value, k10, is also affected in this modeling. Although each individual set of inferred parameters from
each run solves the problem, the differences in k10 between the PINNs and fPINNs models highlight different
solutions. Depending on the modeling approach we choose, the interpretation of the parameters can vary.
Given that these models are not structurally identifiable, we can always obtain different solutions unless we
constrain the search range for each parameter. Nonetheless, for k12(t), we consistently observe the same
dynamics and trend, explaining the fluctuations in the absorption rate, regardless of its exact value.

4.4. Model 4
Paclitaxel (PTX) is a widely used chemotherapy drug for treating various cancers.
It targets micro-
tubules, disrupting their dynamics to induce cell death. Despite its effectiveness, cancer resistance to PTX
poses a significant challenge in clinical settings and is a leading cause of treatment failure and related mortality
[75, 76, 77]. Resistance to chemotherapeutic regimens has been reported for nearly all drugs used to treat the
most lethal cancers. Unfortunately, drug resistance, tolerance, and persistence are often mistakenly regarded
as synonymous, even though they are distinct phenomena, as shown in microbiology [78]. Persistence refers
to the survival of a subpopulation during long-term drug exposure, even as the majority of the population is
killed. Resistance is defined as the ability of an organism to grow at high drug concentrations, typically due
to heritable mutations. Tolerance, on the other hand, refers to how the body handles the drug and how the
drug distribution changes with repeated treatments. Tolerance is reversible, whereas resistance is irreversible.
The tumor growth model is analyzed under a three-dose chemotherapy regimen, as shown in Figure 10.
We focus on the dynamics of the tumor growth variable x1(t), the number of dying cells x2(t), and the
parameters k1(t) and k2(t), which describe the drug’s efficacy and the rate of cell death, respectively. For the
tumor growth dynamic model, we used CMINNs to demonstrate how our novel modeling method with PINNs
can capture various mechanisms from the reduced compartment model. By generalizing the compartment
modeling approach, we can observe the dynamics of parameters in the model, which represents specific aspects

of the phenomena. We trained our neural network over smaller intervals, beginning from the first dose of
the drug. The intervals were set as {[13, 16.99], [16.99, 17.5], [17.5, 20.99], [20.99, 21.5], [21.5, 25], [25, 29],
[29, 32]}. These intervals were selected to focus on capturing the spikes following drug administration, which
occur around the same time as the treatment schedule (e.g., 13, 17, 21). The results for inferred parameters
are shown in Figure 11, which displays the training intervals as well as the drug administration times. The
rate at which damaged cells progress toward death, represented by k1(t), demonstrated dynamic alterations
in response to the multi-dose treatment regimen. Following the initial dose, k1(t) exhibited a sharp spike,
reflecting the rapid death of highly sensitive tumor cells. However, as treatment continued, the peak value
of k1(t) shows a reduction in magnitude and a slight increase in delay after each treatments. This gradual
reduction and delay in k1(t) over time indicate the emergence of resistance. While sensitive cells die off,
the number of resistant cells increases, and these cells may generate even more resistant cells around the
tumor, with some sensitive cells possibly hidden within it. The resistant tumor cell population requires a
greater interval to accumulate lethal damage and die, resulting in smaller peaks between doses after the initial
spike after each dose, which reflects the slower rate of damage in resistant cells. Furthermore, the increasing
delay between doses highlights the adaptive response of the tumor to chemotherapy, with persistent cells
continuing to grow and surviving even after treatment cessation. The parameter k2, a piecewise constant
index of drug efficacy, exhibits a decreasing trend across the treatment timeline, as shown in Figure 11.
Although we did not restrict the training intervals to be only between treatments and included additional
training intervals after each treatment until the next drug exposure, the value of k2 is inferred to be constant
unless a new drug administration occurred. After the first dose, k2 was highest, indicating strong initial drug
efficacy. However, subsequent doses result in progressively lower k2 values, signaling a reduction in the drug’s
ability to inhibit tumor growth. This decline in k2 suggests pharmacokinetic tolerance, where repeated drug
administration leads to changes in the body’s handling of the drug, such as enhanced metabolism or altered
22
drug distribution, resulting in reduced drug concentrations at the tumor site. Consequently, the effective
exposure of the tumor to the drug decreases, contributing to the observed reduction in k2 and the diminished
suppression of tumor growth. The decreasing k2 values thus reflect both pharmacokinetic tolerance and the
tumor’s adaptive resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent. In Figure 12, the tumor weight, represented by
x1(t)+x2(t), exhibits a reduction following each dose of the chemotherapeutic agent, indicative of the drug’s
intended therapeutic effect. However, the magnitude of this reduction diminishes with each successive dose,
particularly after the second and third administrations. This trend suggests the onset of pharmacodynamic
tolerance or resistance, where tumor cells gradually become less responsive to the drug despite repeated
exposure. The declining effect on tumor growth implies that adaptive mechanisms within the tumor may be
at play, potentially involving the activation of survival pathways, mutations that confer drug resistance, or
other cellular adaptations that decrease the drug’s efficacy over time. In Figure 13, we present the results of
tumor growth using the mean values of inferred parameters from fPINNs, as shown in Table 7.
Both approaches show a good fit to the data, but PINNs provide more expressive and explainable results,
offering new insights into the dynamics of adaptive mechanisms involved in chemotherapy.

5. Summary and Discussion
The statistics of drug diffusion in the heterogeneous tissue does not follow normal distribution, hence the
distributed delayed response cannot be faithfully represented by the standard parameterized integer-order
ODEs with constant parameter values. To better model this anomalous diffusion, herein we proposed two
alternative approaches that can also reduce the effective number of ODEs. Rigorous theoretical work in the
recent paper by [74] proved that a system of (n + 1) integer-order ODEs can be replaced by an equivalent
system of (1 + 1) fractional-order ODEs, hence simplifying greatly the computational complexity of the
problem while at the same time revealing the degree of anomalous diffusion via a single parameter, namely
the order of the fractional time-derivative. Herein, we also provide an alternative method of reducing the
number of compartments but introducing time-varying parameters in integer-order ODE systems. Unlike the
fractional case, our proposal is empirical but it is justified by the results on different models we consider in
our study. The implementation we propose based on PINNs and fPINNs is straightforward and can tackle
even ill-posed problems.
Our work presents two significant contributions to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics modeling.
First, we applied the PINNs framework to a pharmacodynamic model with a multi-dose treatment schedule.
To explore how the drug efficacy index changes after each dose, we solved the governing equations in smaller
time intervals. This allowed us to examine variations in the constant parameter for drug efficacy, revealing
that a decrease in this parameter corresponds to diminished drug effects on tumor growth. By employing
the generalized two-ODE framework, our method demonstrated remarkable accuracy due to its flexibility in
capturing multi-exponential and non-exponential decay phases. This led to explainable results that provide
insights into the dynamics of absorption rates for different drugs, the memory effect that explains tissue
trapping or delayed drug responses, and drug tolerance, resistance, and persistence in PD models for tumor
growth. Our findings align with established literature, particularly regarding paclitaxel resistance.
Second, we introduced fPINNs to PKPD modeling, marking the first use of this approach in the field. By
utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks, we automated the optimization of model parameters, especially
fractional orders, as part of the training process.
This innovation simplifies model adaptation, ensuring
that the models achieve optimal alignment with empirical data across various methodologies. The use of
fPINNs enhances the model’s ability to capture complex dynamics, providing a more robust framework for
understanding drug kinetics and responses. We tested various fractionalizing approaches and demonstrated
that different models can yield equivalent results, though they offer different interpretations and aspects to
consider in the modeling process.
In neural networks, catastrophic forgetting can occur, particularly in models addressing long time ranges,
such as multi-dose administration in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic models.
This challenge can
manifest when the network fails to capture one or more critical spikes early in the time series, often due
to becoming trapped in local minima. For fPINNs, we addressed this issue by increasing the discretization
of the FBDF, improving the model’s capacity to capture these dynamics. Meanwhile, in PINNs, sequential
learning—solving the ODEs in continuous intervals—resolves similar issues. The method proposed by [79],
addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Thus, exploring the incorporation of such techniques into
CMINNs presents a promising direction for enhancing model performance across various datasets.
Although fPINNs are effective in handling sparse and noisy data sets, they have some drawbacks. First,
convergence problems can arise due to optimization errors. In addition, using fPINNs as an inverse ODE
solver is significantly more time consuming than using PINNs. However, when compared to conventional
fractional derivative modeling methods, fPINNs provide an automatic, optimal approach. Therefore, future
research should prioritize accelerating the training process of fPINNs for solving inverse ODE problems.
Since the most time-consuming aspect is the computation of fractional derivatives by numerical methods,
the development or use of faster numerical schemes within the fPINNs framework is a critical area for
advancement.
Another challenge is managing small fluctuations in drug concentration values in plasma for pharmacoki-
netic model or tumor size within pharmacodynamic models over extended time periods. Values near zero
and variations within this range can cause the outputs of fPINNs or PINNs to decay rapidly and approach
zero, leading to inaccurate results for the inferred parameters. Additionally, sudden, large-scale changes in
the data can shift the problem’s scale too drastically, causing the neural network to become trapped in local
minima and miss other important data points. This issue was addressed in this work by incorporating both
a feature layer and a scaling layer into the network architecture. Furthermore, adopting a logarithmic scale
for both the training dataset and the corresponding comaprtmental model could be a promising approach
25
to better handle small variations and mitigate abrupt changes, thus enhancing the CMINNs performance
across a broader range of scales. Another potential direction is integrating the CMINNs framework into
state-space models like Mamba, which has been recently applied to predict tumor growth dynamics [80]. By
incorporating additional factors such as resistance, persistence, and tolerance dynamics in tumors—either as
continuous functions or piecewise constants depending on repeated treatments—we may enhance the accuracy
of predictions related to treatment efficacy and tumor behavior under different therapeutic strategies.
