Introduction  
  
The confocal microwave imaging (CMI) algorithm, which is used in radar imaging, has been applied 
to microwave medical imaging (MMI) [1, 2].  In MMI, the diseased region to be imaged has different 
electromagnetic characteristics from that of the surroundings. Time -domain MMI system often 
radiates an ultra-wideband pulse and then collect the backscatter signals with an antenna array. The 
time delay is then compensated for every unit in the array according to the time flight to each focal 
point within the region of interest. The compensated signals are finally summed to calculate the pixel 
value of each focal point. This process is repeated to achieve the value for all focal points in a 3D 
space to reconstruct the image. Since the method is only constrained in the time domain, the 
complexity is minimal, and an image can be obtained usually in few seconds. This paper discusses 
the robustness of CMI in MMI. Specifically, we analyzed the variation of image contrast as errors 
occur in the time-delay calculation. A simplified model of breast cancer detection was implemented 
to study the relationship between time-shift errors and the impact on images, quantitatively.  
  
Simulation and Test  
  
The model is a cuboid with 120 mm long and also 120 mm wide, shown in Fig. 1. The target is a 
spherical tumor (εr = 50, σ = 4) with 4 mm diameter and is buried in medium (typical breast tissue, 
εr = 9 and σ= 0.4). Its center locates at (60, 60, 50). Above the medium surface (z = 75) is air (no 
coupling medium [3] in use for the simplicity reason in this paper). A ultrawide band pulse with 
bandwidth 4.8 GHz, is transmitted by a transmitter which is 2 mm above the medium surface (the 
use of multiple transmitters has been explored in another paper [4]). And 25 receivers are located in 
the same plane (z = 77), forming a synthetic array [5]. The red bright point in the center of the image 
represents a tumor (multiple-tumor case has been explored in [6]). The simulation was processed by 
a self-developed software based on the finite difference time domain (FDTD) approach [7, 8]. The 
confocal algorithm representing the energy summed at 𝑟⃗ is calculated  
𝐸(𝑟⃗) = [∑
𝑇𝑚(𝑡𝑚(𝑟⃗))
𝑀
𝑚=1
]2  
(1)  
where 𝑡𝑚(𝑟⃗) denotes time delay on the mth receiver and Tm(𝑡𝑚(𝑟⃗)) denotes the signal after a time 
shift or compensation. Therefore, there is a need of accurate evaluation of the propagation time from 
the target point to the detectors. Failure to do so may result in the degradation of image contrast. As 
such, the image quality depends on how well the signals are summed at 𝑟⃗, in other words, on the 
evaluation accuracy of the time delay. In our test, we adjusted the accuracy level of time-delay then 
linked to the image contrast. Some imaging results with increasing time-delay percentage error 
(TDPE) corresponding to the reduced contrast is given in Fig. 2. Ratio of signal to mean-noise (𝑆/𝑁̅) 
is applied to represent the contrast. In this paper, we are only caring about contrast, because the 
impact on resolution has been explored in another paper [9].   
 
                                                                            Fig. 3.  Contrast varying with the time-delay

Fig. 3 presents the relation of time-delay percentage error and contrast, denoted by 𝑆/𝑁̅ based on 
20 groups of simulation data. It can be found that contrast decreases fast as the TDPE increases until 
it improves to 13%. Although the contrast goes down slowly after TDPE exceeds 13%, it is difficult 
to recognize the tumor’s location from the image (Fig.2 error=18% and error=25%).  This denotes 
the essential reason of contrast degradation: the existence of the time-delay error. The time delay 
equals the distance between target and the detector divided by the signal’s travelling speed. Usually, 
the followings may cause the time-delay error:  
(1) Antennas’ location setting imprecisely. As the ground-penetrating detection be concerned, 
antenna (array) carried by vehicles or aircrafts has oscillations when it is moving and sampling 
data. This leads to the distance between antenna and imaging point cannot be evaluated precisely. 
Medical imaging has a even stricter requirement. Antennas have to be relocated quite often. 
Some mechanical precision problems cause the antenna unable to be relocated precisely which 
makes the time delay difficult to evaluate very correctly.  
  
No error, 𝑆/𝑁̅ = 11.86 dB  
    Error=6%, 𝑆/𝑁̅ = 10.4 dB 
  Error=9%, 𝑆/𝑁̅ = 8.9 dB 
 Error=12%, 𝑆/𝑁̅ =6.96 dB 
  
  
  
(2) Velocity of detecting signal cannot be understood. Since the ultra-wide band detecting signal 
has a very wide frequency bandwidth, and it is known that the propagation speed is different 
when the frequency changes. Therefore, it is not easy to tell which speed should be applied in 
the calculation. Theoretically, a specific speed value (corresponding to a frequency) must be 
selected as the speed of detecting signal which is based on analysis of frequency spectrum and 
this speed value must be able to reflect the character of the whole detecting signal.  
(3) Targets are buried in an inhomogeneous surrounding. Both of the inhomogeneity of the earth 
for the ground-penetrating detection system, and the inhomogeneity of the tissues for the 
medical detection system can be thought as the inhomogeneity of electromagnetic parameters 
while the electromagnetic method is applied [10]. The propagation speed in medium can be 
written as:  
𝑣=
1
√µ𝜀
2 [1 + ( 𝜎
𝜔𝜀)
2
+ 1]
                   (2) 
where ε, µ, σ represent the permittivity, magnetic conductivity, and electric conductivity, 
respectively. Unpredictability of these parameters of the medium will result in the imprecision of 
evaluation of the signal’s propagation speed. In addition, reflections and refractions exit as the 
microwave signal travels in the inhomogeneous medium. In other words, the travelling path is 
unknown, thus the path length cannot be precisely estimated. As a result, neither the speed nor the 
distance can be accurately known.  
  
The electromagnetic parameters of the medium can be set in our FDTD program, and so we 
can study the relation of inhomogeneity of the medium and contrast directly, which is given in 
table 1. With this table we can also find the equivalent translation for the inhomogeneity of medium 
and the TDPE. For instance, as the inhomogeneity of medium is 10% (εr =8.1~ 9.9, σ= 3.6 ~ 4.4 , 
for the typical value for breast tissues is εr = 9 and σ= 0.4 ), it will result in a 9% TDPE and will 
give an imaging result with the contrast is 9 dB.

Conclusion  
 The confocal microwave imaging algorithm requires to carry out the flight time of the 
backscattered signals from the target (or imaging) point to the detectors. We discussed three factors 
that may cause the image contrast decrease. It is pointed out in this paper that the inaccurate 
calculation of time-delay is the result of those three factors and is the final reason for the decrease of 
contrast. Finally, the numerical relation regarding the contrast and time delay percentage error is 
given. According to method we applied in this paper, the relationship of the time-delay error and the 
resolution, which is another very important parameter in imaging work, can also be studied.  
 
 
Afterword 
The work presented in this conference paper was afterwards published on a journal [11] with 
more detailed analysis. Although lately there have been many advanced algorithms and prototypes 
[12] developed to reconstructed images using collected microwave signals, the CMI approach is a 
simple but effective, also rapid method for the MMI study. Those more advance approaches increase 
the complexity in signal processing, often leading to longer computational time. In recent years, 
machine-learning algorithms have been applied to medical image reconstruction [13], assisted by 
more efficient simulation technique [14] to provide training data. Theses algorithms exhibit 
superpower such as super resolution, low noise, and fast speed, in solving inverse problems, 
surpassing the existing conventional algorithms. We are looking forward the machine-learning 
algorithms being applied to microwave breast imaging one day and give us surprises, and this will 
probably be real very soon!
