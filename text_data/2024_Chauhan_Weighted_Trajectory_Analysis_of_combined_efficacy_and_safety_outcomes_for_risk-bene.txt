Abstract 
 
Purpose: Analyzing and effectively communicating the efficacy and toxicity of treatment 
is the fundamental basis of risk benefit analysis (RBA). There is a need for more 
efficient and objective tools. We apply Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) 
to perform RBA with superior objectivity, power, and ease of communication. 
 
Methods: We used CWTA to perform 1000-fold simulations of RCTs using ordinal 
endpoints that captured both treatment efficacy and treatment toxicity. RCTs were 
stochastically generated with 1:1 allocation at defined sample sizes and hazard ratios. 
We first studied the simplest case simulation of 3 levels each of toxicity and efficacy (a 3 
x 3 matrix). We then simulated the general case of the advanced cancer trial, with 
efficacy graded by five RECIST 1.1 health statuses and toxicity graded by the six-point 
CTCAE scale to create a 6 x 5 matrix. Finally, the 6 x 5 matrix model was applied to a 
real-world dose escalation phase I trial in advanced cancer.  
 
Results:  Simulations in both the 3 x 3 simplest case matrix and the 6 x 5 advanced 
cancer matrix confirmed our hypothesis that drugs with both superior efficacy and 
toxicity profiles synergize for greater statistical power with CWTA RBA than either signal 
alone. The CWTA RBA 6 x 5 matrix meaningfully reduced sample size requirements 
over CWTA efficacy-only analysis. Despite a small sample size, application of the matrix 
to each of the seven cohorts of the dose finding phase I clinical trial provided objective 
and statistically significant validation for the dose subjectively selected by the trialists. 
 
Conclusion: CWTA RBA, by incorporating both drug efficacy and the trajectory of drug 
toxicity, provides a single test statistic and summary plot that analyzes, visualizes, and 
effectively communicates the risk-benefit assessment of a clinical trial. CWTA RBA 
requires fewer patients than CWTA efficacy-only analysis when the experimental drug is 
both more effective and less toxic. Our results show CWTA RBA has the potential to aid 
the objective and efficient assessment of new therapies throughout the drug 
development pathway. Furthermore, its distinct advantages over competing tests in 
visualizing and communicating risk-benefit will assist regulatory review, clinical 
adoption, and understanding of therapeutic risks and benefits by clinicians and patients 
alike. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Risk-benefit analysis in therapeutic assessment 
Risk-benefit analysis (RBA) is the fundamental evaluation of a therapeutic intervention. 
In broad terms, RBA addresses the questions “Is this intervention more likely to help 
than harm? Is intervention A better than intervention B, when both efficacy and safety 
are considered?”  
 
RBA is essential to the design, ethical review and regulatory approval to start a study, 
where the potential benefits to patients are predicted to potentially outweigh the risks 
[1]. Subsequently, during the conduct of clinical trials, repeated RBAs are performed, 
often by involved investigators in early phase trials, or by independent data monitoring 
committees in phase II, III, and registrational studies, to ensure that the potential 
benefits of a clinical trial continue to outweigh the risks to participants. On completion of 
a trial, the risk-benefit assessment is the key metric on which the decision to advance 
through additional later stage trials, or seek regulatory approval, is based. Finally, the 
decisions of individual clinicians, insurance payers, and clinical guideline committees 
are predicated on the careful assessment of risk-benefit for individual patients and 
populations.  In most cases, the RBA is a subjective assessment by experts informed of 
the totality of the safety and efficacy data, without the use of a formal statistical analytic 
tool that incorporates both safety and efficacy signals [2]. 
 
In the context of new drug development, RBAs are hampered by several practical 
problems. In early-stage drug trials (first-in-human interventions, first-in-class drugs, and 
dose-finding studies), the nature, severity, and duration of adverse events is largely 
unknown, as pre-clinical models have only limited predictive ability for clinical toxicities 
[3,4]. Furthermore, patient benefit in early-stage trials is generally not expected until 
effective doses are established, so formal risk-benefit calculations in this setting are 
difficult to pre-specify. Typically, the aggregated experience of the patients in these 
studies is assessed subjectively, with particular emphasis on safety signals rather than 
efficacy. Finally, sample sizes are typically small and not amenable to standard 
statistical analytic techniques. 
 
Even after key drug toxicities are identified and the recommended phase II doses are 
established, ongoing monitoring of risk-benefit still presents challenges in phase II, III, 
and phase IV settings. RBA is either formally or informally conducted by iterative 
reviews of patient outcomes during the clinical trial, typically presented as tables of most 
common and most severe adverse events, summary tables of efficacy signals, and 
lengthy and complex individual patient narratives [1]. These safety and efficacy data are 
complex to communicate, lack a unified statistical methodology that incorporates both, 
and are not readily displayed visually. In consequence, it is difficult to quickly grasp the 
timing, the reversibility, and the duration of toxicities from the standard presentation of 
clinical trial results while balancing them with the timing and magnitude of clinical 
efficacy experienced by patients on trial therapy. Furthermore, RBA is particularly 
complicated in the setting of a disease where the natural history of the illness varies in 
severity over time, independent of treatment effects, where the aggregated assessment 
of risk and benefit is more difficult than either assessment in isolation. 
 
Limitations of Kaplan-Meier analysis for efficacy and toxicity assessments 
The Kaplan-Meier analysis with logrank testing [5] is the gold-standard method for 
analysis of efficacy outcomes in most trials, including those in cancer patients.  The KM 
estimator has many advantages: it is a nonparametric method, making it suitable for 
analyzing time-to-event data that may not follow a normal distribution, and it can handle 
censored data effectively, where some individuals may not experience the event of 
interest by the end of the study, ensuring that these individuals are appropriately 
accounted for in the analysis. The KM estimator is typically used in conjunction with the 
logrank test, which allows hypothesis testing to compare survival curves between 
different treatment groups in clinical trials. While the KM estimator provides a robust and 
widely accepted method for estimating survival functions from lifetime data, it does have 
several important limitations that reduce its utility. In particular, KM analyzes only a 
single time-dependent endpoint for each trial participant, and cannot provide a single 
analysis that incorporates the many key efficacy endpoints that may occur during a 
cancer patient’s clinical course, including disease response, progression, and death. 
Furthermore, KM analysis can only model unidirectional outcomes (for example 
progression of disease) and cannot model the bi-directional outcomes such as initial 
disease response, followed by later disease progression, and eventual death, that 
represent the typical illness trajectory of patients with advanced cancer on clinical trials 
[6]. 
 
 
Limitations of adverse event tables for safety assessments 
The typical output of clinical trial safety assessments are tables of the highest grade of 
each CTCAE toxicity experienced by study subjects, where the trajectory of these side 
effects is not plotted for visual inspection, but must be derived from detailed reading of 
individual narrative reports for affected patients [1,2].  As such, the timing and the 
rapidity of onset, the reversibility and duration of maximal toxicity, and the rapidity of 
adverse event resolution is not typically detailed in clinical study reports or clinical trial 
publications. 
  
Rationale for CWTA in RBA 
Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis [7] was specifically developed to address the 
limitations of KM analysis, while retaining a visual and test statistic output that would be 
easily interpreted by clinical and regulatory communities due to its similarity to KM 
analysis. A generalization of the KM methodology, CWTA has several advantages over 
traditional KM analysis. CWTA permits the assessment of outcomes defined by various 
ordinal grades or stages or clinical severity, which are common in medical settings but 
challenging to analyze using traditional methods like the KM estimator. Importantly, it 
facilitates continued analysis following changes in health state which may be 
bidirectional (disease recovery or exacerbation), providing a more comprehensive view 
of the trajectory of clinical outcomes [7]. 
 
CWTA also retains the merits of KM analysis. It is a non-parametric method with the 
ability to censor patients who withdraw or are lost to follow-up, ensuring robust analysis 
of clinical outcomes. CWTA, like KM, provides a graphical summary plot that visually 
depicts the trajectories of patients over time, making it easy to interpret and compare 
outcomes between different treatment arms. This is particularly important in the setting 
of clinical oncology, where oncologists have become accustomed to seeing a single plot 
for efficacy endpoints of clinical trials, in which the separation of the control and 
experimental curves conveys meaningful information as to the differential effects of 
treatment through time.  Finally, CWTA introduces a weighted logrank test, a 
modification of the traditional logrank test, to assess the statistical significance of 
differences in trajectories between groups, providing a rigorous method for hypothesis 
testing that is also a familiar analog for clinicians and regulatory agents [7].  
 
Furthermore, CWTA is a more powerful analytic tool than KM analysis. We recently 
reported that in the setting of advanced cancer efficacy studies, by using all efficacy 
signals (CR, PR, SD, PD and death), CWTA was markedly more powerful than KM 
analysis for the standard single endpoints of PFS or OS [8]. Sample size reductions 
ranged from 15% to 35%, and time to first efficacy signals were reduced by two- to six-
fold. Consequently, CWTA is particularly advantageous in deriving early informative 
efficacy signals in small sample size studies, populations of patients with rare diseases, 
and studies where enrollment capacity is limited.  
 
We hypothesized that the risk-benefit analyses of many clinical trials are hampered by 
the lack of a single analytic tool that incorporates both efficacy and safety signals and 
conveys the aggregated signal in a visually intuitive, statistically tractable, and easily 
communicated manner. Due to the complexity and subjectivity of the risk-benefit 
assessment process throughout the drug development process, we sought and 
developed a tool that can simultaneously incorporate both benefit (efficacy) endpoints 
and risk (safety) endpoints in a single objective metric, display this visually, and conduct 
a formal statistical comparison of group outcomes.  We developed and modeled this 
tool in the context of advanced cancer, using standard RECIST 1.1 criteria [9] for 
efficacy and CTCAE v5.0 criteria [10] for toxicity. For clinical validation with a real-world 
trial dataset, we then applied the CWTA RBA methodology to an early-stage clinical trial 
in advanced cancer by incorporating both comprehensive efficacy outcomes, together 
with detailed daily toxicity outcomes, to evaluate the clinical benefit of a novel therapy.  
 
Methods 
Definitions 
To study CWTA risk-benefit analysis, we created simulation models at two levels of 
complexity. 
 
For the first model, a 3 x 3 matrix outlined in Table 2, we defined three efficacy states 
(healthy, sick, dead) and three safety states (toxicity none, toxicity some, lethal toxicity). 
The goal of the first model is to test the hypothesis that a drug that both reduces 
morbidity and has lower toxicity compared to a drug with only one (or neither) of these 
attributes will demonstrate greater statistical power in CWTA RBA analysis. 
 
Our second model was a 6 x 5 matrix described in Table 4. 6 rows correspond to tiers 
of toxicity based on CTCAE v5.0 [10], which range from no toxicity to fatal toxicity; 5 
columns correspond to tiers of efficacy including complete response (CR), partial 
response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD), and death defined 
as per RECIST 1.1 criteria [9]. The goal of the second model is to (i) demonstrate how 
clinical grading systems can easily be integrated in CWTA RBA and (ii) test the intuition 
established in the first model that combined efficacy and toxicity analysis offers greater 
statistical power compared to efficacy analysis alone. The same matrix is later applied 
to the real world advancer cancer validation study. 
 
Simulation design 
The simulation studies were generated using Python 3.8 [11]. Study simulations were 
stochastic processes in which randomly generated numbers are programmed to mirror 
fluctuating disease response to chemotherapy cycles with weekly measurements of 
treatment efficacy and toxicity. Patients could only change one efficacy level per month 
but could transition weekly to any toxicity level; higher likelihoods were assigned for 
transitions to more proximal scores. Event probabilities were modified between groups 
as defined by a hazard ratio (HR). We did not model patient dropout. We performed 
1000-fold simulations of chemotherapy RCTs at defined sample size (SS) allocated 1:1 
to control or intervention and run for a defined number of weeks and used CWTA 
(weighted logrank test) to determine statistical significance. 
 
 
Simplest case simulation – 3 toxicity x 3 efficacy matrix 
We first modeled the simplest possible state for combined efficacy and toxicity 
assessment, a 3 x 3 matrix with variables defined in Table 1 and depicted in Table 2. 
We set up simulation scenarios, ran them each 1000 times, and sought statistically 
significant differences between the arms. Each scenario was run with a sample size of 
600 patients for a total of 210 weeks to mirror large scale randomized trial parameters. 
Hazard ratios of 0.5, 1, and 2 are used for simplicity and reciprocal property. 
 
Simulation of the 3 x 3 matrix for RBAs was performed for each of the five possible 
scenarios from each of the five possible cases of relative efficacy and toxicity: i) more 
efficacy, same toxicity, ii) same efficacy, less toxicity, iii) more efficacy, less toxicity, iv) 
more efficacy, more toxicity, and v) same efficacy, same toxicity. In case i, the 
experimental drug was more effective than the control drug [HR 0.5 for illness or death 
from disease progression] but equally toxic [HR 1.0 for illness or death from toxicity]. In 
case ii, the experimental drug was equally effective as the control drug [HR 1.0] but was 
less toxic than the control drug [HR 0.5].  In case iii, the experimental drug was both 
more effective [HR 0.5] and less toxic [HR 0.5] than the control drug. In case iv, the 
experimental drug was more effective than the control drug [HR 0.5] but more toxic than 
the control drug [HR 2.0]. In case v, the experimental drug was equally effective and 
equally toxic when compared to the control drug [HR 1.0 for both].  
 
 
 
Advanced cancer trial simulation: 5 efficacy x 6 toxicity matrix 
 
This simulation was built on the 6 stages of CTCAE toxicity and the five stages of 
RECIST 1.1 efficacy outlined in Table 3, as per standard methods in advanced cancer 
trials. This created the matrix shown in Table 4. As per our previous publications on 
using CWTA in cancer efficacy studies, all patients we assigned SD at time 0 and, each 
month, were capable of response (PR then CR), maintained SD, or irreversible 
exacerbation to PD or Death [7,8]. We modeled a control group CR rate of ~10% and a 
PR rate of ~50% to reflect first-line advanced cancer RCTs. Power was evaluated at 
increments of SS (20 to 320 patients in increments of 30) and HR (0.6, 0.7, and 0.8). 
The required sample size for i) combined efficacy and toxicity as per Table 4 and ii) 
efficacy alone were directly compared. 
 
Statistical analysis 
CWTA was performed as previously described [7] augmented by a cloud-native cluster, 
with workloads executed in parallel across optimized Google Compute Engine virtual 
machines. For each trial, a p-value was computed using CWTA (weighted logrank test). 
The fraction of tests that were significant (at α < 0.05) represents the power of the test 
(correctly rejecting the null hypothesis that the two groups are the same). At each 
hazard ratio in our second model, a sample size requirement was interpolated as the 
threshold to reach 0.8 power, a common standard in RCT design. 
 
 
 
Real world advanced cancer validation study 
Our validation study was an analysis of real-world data from a published dose 
escalation study in patients with advanced cancer. The PCLX-001-01 study evaluated 
escalating doses of continuous therapy with an oral anticancer drug, zelenirstat [12]. In 
this trial, 29 patients were assigned to various dose cohorts as shown in Table 5.  
Patients took zelenirstat until dose limiting toxicity was experienced or until progressive 
cancer was identified. Progressive cancer was identified by applying RECIST 1.1 
criteria to CT scans performed every two months. Adverse events were logged for each 
day of study participation and defined and graded by CTCAE v5.0 criteria [10]. For this 
CWTA RBA, we restricted our analysis to symptomatic toxicities that developed on 
therapy (also known as treatment-emergent toxicities) mapped to CTCAE v5.0. Due to 
the palliative nature of the population treated in this advanced cancer setting, we 
excluded asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities. Each day on therapy was assigned a 
highest-grade symptomatic toxicity as per CTCAE criteria, and health states for each of 
the 29 subjects were assigned daily for each study day based on the 6 x 5 matrix as per 
Table 4.  
 
Results 
Overview of findings 
We first modeled the simplest possible state for combined efficacy and toxicity 
assessment, a 3 x 3 matrix. Simulation of the 3 x 3 matrix for CWTA RBAs confirmed all 
expectations for each of the five possible scenarios mapped to five possible 
combinations of relative efficacy and toxicity: i) more efficacy, same toxicity, ii) same 
efficacy, less toxicity, iii) more efficacy, less toxicity, iv) more efficacy, more toxicity, and 
v) same efficacy, same toxicity.  As expected and shown in Figure 1, CWTA identified 
visually different and statistically significantly different (as assessed by weighted logrank 
testing) curves in cases i through iv; curves were overlapping and the weighted logrank 
test was non-significant in cases ii, iv, and v. The aggregate results of 1000-fold 
simulations are shown in Figure 2, in which only combination iii, which synergized 
improved efficacy and lower toxicity, resulted in power beyond 0.8, the typical standard 
for trial design.  
 
Next, we modeled the case of an advanced cancer trial, in which efficacy signals were 
categorized as 5 possible ordinal variables as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, and toxicity was 
classified as per CTCAE 5.0 criteria in which there are six ordinal variables of toxicity. 
We conducted simulations of the 6 x 5 matrix RBA in Table 4 across a range of hazard 
ratios favoring the experimental arm for both efficacy and toxicity (0.6, 0.7, and 0.8) and 
a range of samples sizes (20 to 320 patients in increments of 30). A single 
representative trial showing CWTA RBA vs CWTA efficacy only is shown in Figure 3, 
while overall results are shown in Figure 4.  These results show that RBA outperforms 
CWTA efficacy only analysis of studies when both efficacy and safety signals are 
favorable for the experimental drug. Sample sizes required to achieve 80% power were 
reduced by applying RBA, with larger reductions as hazard ratios approached 1.0; 
sample size reductions were 17% at a hazard ratio of 0.6 (RBA 44 patients vs. CWTA 
efficacy 53 patients), 18% at a hazard ratio of 0.7 (RBA 87 patients vs CWTA efficacy 
106 patients), and 24% reduction at a hazard ratio of 0.8 (RBA 212 patients vs. CWTA 
efficacy 279 patients).  Sensitivity analysis (data not shown) confirmed that, as 
expected, improved efficacy can be offset by worsened toxicity in the experimental arm.  
 
Finally, we validated the 6 x 5 matrix CWTA RBA with real world data derived from a 
completed and published phase I dose escalation clinical trial in advanced cancer [12]. 
This phase I study involved evaluation of seven doses of a first-in-class small molecule 
inhibitor of N-myristoylation, zelenirstat. In this dose escalation study, 29 patients were 
administered daily continuous oral zelenirstat at one of seven dose levels (Table 5). 
The trialists then used the standard toxicity assessment methods to define the 
Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) as first cycle Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) occurring 
at a frequency of 33% or less, after which the efficacy signals were subjectively 
integrated into the decision to select dose level 6, 210 mg daily continuous therapy, as 
the recommended phase 2 dose for subsequent studies [12]. We applied the 6 x 5 
CWTA RBA matrix to the completed zelenirstat trial database as shown in Figure 5. 
These results confirmed that the recommended phase II dose, 210 mg daily, provided 
the statistically best combined health status for patients on that cohort, when compared 
the aggregated health status of the patients treated on other cohorts, and was the only 
dose level to show significantly better outcomes. Thus, CWTA RBA objectively validated 
the investigator’s subjective choice of cohort 6 as the recommended phase II dose. 
 
Discussion 
Risk-benefit analysis (RBA) is an essential component to the development and 
evaluation of any health intervention. It is a complex assessment, representing the 
integration of efficacy / relative efficacy signals and safety / relative safety signals 
across the spectrum of clinical trials, regulatory reviews, and knowledge translation to 
clinical providers. We previously lacked a statistical tool that integrates both safety and 
efficacy signals, incorporates the trajectory of both disease and toxicity, yields a single 
test statistic, and readily communicates these outcomes visually. 
 
In this study, we began with simulations of simplified therapeutic trials with three 
efficacy categories and three safety categories. We demonstrate that this model can 
produce composite CWTA analyses that accurately reflect the risk-benefit scenarios we 
modeled, across a range of therapeutic efficacy rates and toxicity rates (Figures 1, 2). 
These results confirmed the intuitive assumptions that CWTA could correctly identify an 
experimental drug that had better efficacy than the control drug, better toxicity than the 
control drug, or both better efficacy and toxicity. As expected, more effective but more 
toxic drugs did not show improved CWTA RBA. 
 
Next, we simulated the more complex scenario of an advanced cancer therapy trial, in 
which efficacy status was captured with five categories (CR, PR, SD, PD, and Death), 
which key toxicities were captured with CTCAE v5.0 categorized toxicities ranging from 
grade 0 (no toxicity) to grade 5 (fatal). In this simulation, efficacy was assessed monthly, 
while adverse events were modeled with weekly changes, reflecting the real world 
complexities of an advanced cancer trial. We demonstrated that across a range of 
clinically relevant efficacy rates, as identified by hazard ratios compared to control 
therapies, and various assumptions of toxicity rates, CWTA could address these 
complexities and distill the risk-benefit assessment into a relatively simple single metric 
and single visualization. Importantly, CWTA RBA was more powerful than CWTA 
efficacy alone, requiring fewer patients to demonstrate superiority of a drug that is both 
more effective and less toxic. Given that CWTA efficacy analyses already are 
substantially more effective than standard Kaplan-Meier analyses of Progression Free 
Survival and Overall Survival in the settings of advanced cancer [8], this demonstrates 
that CWTA RBA permits markedly smaller sample sizes than standard KM endpoints in 
advanced cancer, further reducing subject numbers, time to completion of study, and 
trial costs. 
 
Finally, we applied CWTA to a real-world clinical trial dataset derived from a dose 
escalation trial using the first in class agent, zelenirstat. While this drug had not 
previously been studied in humans, pre-clinical toxicities were primarily those of 
gastrointestinal events. As such, a pre-specified list of adverse events of special interest 
(AEIs) and a selection of dose limiting toxicities were assigned prior to launching the 
study. As the cancer population was treatment refractory, with a median of four prior 
courses of systemic therapy (ranging up to 8), the population was not healthy and had 
baseline symptoms including fatigue, neuropathy, and others. Despite the complexities 
of the trial population and the small number of patients in each cohort, CWTA RBA 
clearly demonstrated its utility in this complex setting, correctly identifying the go 
forward dose derived from the standard, subjective analysis of the study. That CWTA 
achieved statistical significance when the RPD2 cohort (n=7) was compared to non-
RPD2 cohort patients (n=22), was a striking validation of the power of CWTA RBA in 
analysis of trials with small sample sizes. 
 
Our findings are particularly relevant in the context of regulatory efforts to improve dose 
and schedule optimization in the context of clinical trials. The US FDA’s Project Optimus 
is an initiative by the Oncology Center of Excellence aimed at reforming the dose 
optimization and dose selection paradigm in oncology drug development [13-15]. 
Traditionally, dosages for oncology drugs were selected based on the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD), which may lead to severe toxicities without additional efficacy 
benefits. Project Optimus seeks to address this by encouraging early and rigorous 
dose-finding studies that balance efficacy and safety, minimizing long-term toxicities 
and improving patient outcomes. CWTA, applied to this effort, would provide statistical 
rigor and objective criteria on which the optimal dose and schedule of cancer drugs is 
based. 
 
Effectively communicating the risks and benefits to participants in clinical trials, 
healthcare professionals, and the public is critical and challenging. Miscommunication 
can lead to misunderstandings about the safety and efficacy of a drug, impacting patient 
trust and the overall perception of the drug’s value. Currently, communicating clinical 
benefit and clinical toxicity is difficult, due in part to the lack of methods to integrate both 
into a single, easily explained metric. For example, the dramatic efficacy of COVID-19 
vaccines in reducing hospitalization and death was, in public communications, largely 
disassociated from the potential for rare, albeit serious, adverse effects [16]. In principle, 
using CWTA to integrate both efficacy (freedom from hospitalization, ICU, and death) 
and key safety considerations with serious adverse events (acute vaccine reactions, 
myocarditis, Guillain Barre syndrome) could provide a single, easily explained, readily 
visualized difference in health status between a vaccinated and unvaccinated 
populations. 
 
Our methodology is distinct from decision analytic models, which are mathematical tools 
used to aid decision-making in situations of uncertainty. Such models help evaluate 
different decision paths based on their potential outcomes and the probabilities of these 
outcomes. In particular, Bayesian trials can be structured to assess both safety and 
efficacy endpoints simultaneously. This is achieved by defining prior probabilities for 
both the efficacy and safety of the intervention, and then updating these probabilities as 
data on these endpoints are collected throughout the trial. However, CWTA, unlike 
Bayesian trials, can give time-dependent toxicity assessments that recover, unlike the 
typical Bayesian design where toxicities of a certain severity (typically grade 3 or higher) 
are tallied as discrete isolated incidents, irrespective of their duration. Consequently, 
CWTA gives a more nuanced and accurate reflection of the patient experience, 
particularly in settings of transient toxicities which are either self-limited or responsive to 
therapy. Furthermore, full Bayesian risk-benefit analyses are difficult to communicate 
and are not reducible to a single test statistic and a simple graphic representation. 
 
In the absence of defined or known key toxicities, such as in the early-stage trial setting, 
CWTA can be structured to assess efficacy signals in tandem with any toxicities, as we 
did here with the zelenirstat study, agnostic to the specifics of the toxicity experienced 
by the study subjects. However, CWTA can be customized to address RBA in the 
context of phase II trials and beyond, where the key toxicities of the intervention are 
known prior to study inception. In such a setting, adverse events of special interest 
could be prospectively incorporated into a study-specific ordinal outcome matrix which 
ranks the clinical importance of the toxicities, relating them to the clinical importance of 
efficacy metrics, to generate a combined ordinal ranking that can be used as the 
primary CWTA RBA endpoint throughout the trial. 
 
Our study has limitations. We specifically addressed the context of advanced cancer 
trials in our second simulation model and our real-world analysis, in which CTCAE 
adverse events were integrated into cancer efficacy endpoints. In principle, our findings 
are expected to be generalizable to other efficacy scales and other toxicity scales, as 
the improved power of the methodology comes from incorporation of the full dataset in 
the analyses. We have, however, not explored other matrices which might be more 
relevant to non-oncology studies. We suspect that the methodology and learnings from 
this study are generally applicable to medical device trials, public health interventions, 
and industrial applications, and these will be areas for further research. 
Finally, CWTA RBA benefits from very granular data on timing, severity, and resolution 
of toxicity data; while these data are captured in case report forms, some additional 
programming is required to extract the trajectory of all adverse events, rather than the 
usual reporting of rates of individuals with high grade toxicities. 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
CWTA RBA, by incorporating the efficacy and toxicity signals throughout the entirety of 
the health trajectory of trial participants, provides a single statistic and summary plot 
that analyzes and effectively communicates the risks and benefits of a clinical trial 
intervention. CWTA RBA can be fruitfully applied even to small phase I studies, and can 
provide objective evaluations at any point in a study and across the spectrum of clinical 
trials of new therapeutics. Our data confirm that using CWTA RBA could aid the 
assessment of new therapies at multiple levels, including the design phase of clinical 
trials, interim analyses, adaptive design assessment of alternative therapies, regulatory 
review, and clinical adoption and communication of therapeutic benefit to clinicians, 
patients, and funders. We propose CWTA as a flexible and pragmatic tool for aggregate 
assessment of risk-benefit in the development and comparative assessment of health 
interventions.

Table 5. Dose-escalation Treatment Cohorts in Pacylex zelenirstat phase I dose 
escalation clinical trial. Using standard subjective assessment of toxicities and 
efficacy signals, dose level 6 had been selected by the clinical trialists and published as 
the recommended dose with which to conduct subsequent clinical trials (reference 6). 
CWTA provides objective statistical validation for this decision.

Figure 1. 3x3 simulation of combined efficacy and toxicity assessments. 
Each panel below shows a single representative trial from each of the five possible 
combinations of relative efficacy and toxicity: i) more efficacy, same toxicity, ii) same 
efficacy, less toxicity, iii) more efficacy, less toxicity, iv) more efficacy, more toxicity, and 
v) same efficacy, same toxicity.  Only trials i and iii demonstrated statistical significance 
at α = 0.05.

Figure 2. 3x3 simulation Overall Comparison 
Each horizontal bar represents the overall power of 1000-fold simulated trials defined by 
five possible combinations of relative efficacy and toxicity: i) more efficacy, same 
toxicity, ii) same efficacy, less toxicity, iii) more efficacy, less toxicity, iv) more efficacy, 
more toxicity, and v) same efficacy, same toxicity.  Only case iii, where improved 
efficacy synergized with lower toxicity, resulted in power beyond 0.8 (dashed vertical 
line), a usual standard for trial design. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Figure 3. 6 toxicity x 5 efficacy matrix simulation comparing RBA vs. CWTA 
efficacy only 
A single representative trial showing RBA vs CWTA efficacy is shown here, where the 
efficacy HR was 0.8 and the toxicity HR was also at 0.8 for the experimental arm. Here, 
we see at sample size of 200 subjects, RBA analysis was statistically significant, while 
the efficacy only CWTA analysis was negative.

ii) CWTA RBA (p = 0.014) 
 
 
 
Figure 4. 6 toxicity x 5 efficacy matrix simulations: power as a function of sample 
size. We conducted simulations of the 6 x 5 matrix RBA across a range of hazard ratios 
favoring the experimental arm for both efficacy and toxicity (0.6, 0.7, and 0.8) and a 
range of samples sizes (20 to 320 patients in increments of 30) to compare CWTA RBA 
with CWTA efficacy-alone analysis. Sample size reductions were 17% at a hazard ratio 
of 0.6 (RBA 44 patients vs. CWTA efficacy 53 patients), 18% at a hazard ratio of 0.7 
(RBA 87 patients vs CWTA efficacy 106 patients), and 24% reduction at a hazard ratio 
of 0.8 (RBA 212 patients vs. CWTA efficacy 279 patients). 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Zelenirstat dose escalation RBA with 6 toxicity x 5 efficacy matrix 
analysis. 
Each panel below illustrates the RBA analysis of each cohort vs. the aggregated 
outcomes of all other cohorts. Patients on cohort 3 did significantly worse than other 
cohorts, while patients on cohort 6, had significantly better heath status than patients on 
other cohorts. This result objectively validates the subjective assessment of the clinical 
trialists, who recommended proceeding with the 210 mg daily dose for subsequent 
clinical trials.
