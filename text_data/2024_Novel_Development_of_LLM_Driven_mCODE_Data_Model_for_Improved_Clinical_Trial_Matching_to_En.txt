Background Information and 
Introduction
Prevalence of Data Standardization and the 
Onset of FHIR and LLM’s in Healthcare
The healthcare industry has witnessed a significant 
transformation in recent years, driven by the integra-
tion of advanced technologies such as Large Language 
Models (LLMs) and sophisticated data standardiza-
tion and analysis techniques. This shift has been par-
ticularly impactful in oncology and in addressing the 
unique challenges faced by rural and underserved 
healthcare facilities and regions. The advent and adop-
tion of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has laid the 
foundation for this digital revolution, enabling the 
collection and analysis of vast amounts of patient data

Abstract: Each year, the lack of efficient data standardization and interoperability in cancer care 
contributes to the severe lack of timely and effective diagnosis, while constantly adding to the 
burden of cost with cancer costs nationally reaching over $208 billion in 2023 alone. Traditional 
methods regarding clinical trial enrollment and clinical care in oncology are often manual, time-
consuming, and lack a data-driven approach.  This paper presents a novel framework to streamline 
standardization, interoperability and exchange of cancer domains and enhance the integration 
of oncology-based EHRs across disparate healthcare systems. This paper utilizes advanced LLMs 
and Computer Engineering to streamline cancer clinical trials and discovery. By utilizing FHIR’s 
resource-based approach and LLM-generated mCODE profiles, we ensure timely, accurate and ef-
ficient sharing of patient information across disparate healthcare systems.   
Our methodology involves transforming unstructured patient treatment data, PDF’s, free-text information, 
and progress notes into enriched mCODE profiles, facilitating seamless integration with our novel AI and ML 
based clinical trial matching engine. The results of this study show a significant improvement in data standard-
ization, with accuracy rates of our trained LLM peaking at over 92% with datasets consisting of thousands of 
patient’s data. Additionally, our LLM demonstrated an accuracy rate of 87% for SNOMED-CT, 90% for LOINC, 
and 84% for RxNorm codes. This trumps the current status quo, with LLM’s such as GPT-4 and Claude’s 3.5 
peaking at an average of 77%. This paper successfully underscores the potential of our standardization and in-
teroperability framework, paving the way for more efficient and personalized cancer treatment.

at an unprecedented scale.  
EHRs (Electronic Health Records) have been a 
critical first step in getting all healthcare information 
on computers, with adoption rates in the United States 
reaching 96% with the help of the Government push-
ing the use of the HITECH Act and the Cures Act.  
This recognition has been taken up by most major 
technology companies about the potential of health-
care data analytics, followed by a significant invest-
ment in the area. For example, Watson for Oncology 
by IBM attempted to leverage Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) to help in decision-making regarding the treat-
ment of cancer [1]. Similarly, Apple’s Health Records 
feature has tried to empower patients with access to 
information in their medical records across various 
healthcare providers [2]. These initiatives are laudable 
but again point towards the conundrum unsolved of 
integrating diverse data sources and translating com-
plex medical information into actionable insights.  
The introduction of LLMs into healthcare has the 
potential to be groundbreaking in the interpretation 
and analysis of data. These models process and gener-
ate text that is applicable to a human-like extent, thus 
providing unprecedented opportunities for deriving 
meaningful insights from unstructured medical data 
that constitute clinical notes and patient profiles. In 
the oncology field, LLMs show potential interest in 
tumor classification, treatment recommendation, and 
prognosis prediction [3]. However, all these sophisti-
cated tools rely on the quality and interoperability of 
the underlying data. This is where the Fast Healthcare 
Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard comes 
into play.  
Of importance to this note is that FHIR finally be-
gins to offer solutions to one of the most significant 
obstacles health systems have struggled with up until 
now - the ability of one system to communicate with 
another using open internet technologies and data 
formats.  
FHIR provides a standardized approach to the 
sharing of healthcare data, allowing heterogeneous 
systems to interoperate with one another properly. 
In this manner, it provides a common language for 
healthcare data, and hence, merging the diverse 
sources of data is made more accessible to therefore 
be used in creating a more comprehensive view of pa-
tient health.  
FHIR x mCODE in the Oncology Industry
It is in this complex context of Oncology that the 
combination of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Re-
sources (FHIR) and Minimal Common Oncology 
Data Elements (mCODE) will become a driving force 
for a new age in data interoperability and analysis. 
Incorporating FHIR in Oncological settings will 
facilitate an easy integration of many different data 
sources, from EHR systems to genomic databases 
and imaging systems. Mandel et al. (2016) further 
presented evidence that using applications based on 
FHIR leads to a significant advancement of clinical 
workflow and considerably improves data access in 
oncology settings, which directly yields a high level 
of clinical decisions and personalized treatment plans 
[4].
Even though FHIR provides this kind of infrastruc-
ture, standardization should be specified for oncol-
ogy data by mCODE, hence the prerogative of this 
paper to begin the development and integration of this 
model. mCODE defines a core set of structured data 
elements for oncology EHRs. The standard spans six 
principal domains: patient, disease, lab/vital, genomics, 
treatment, and outcome. The patient domain involves 
demographics and comorbidities, while the disease 
domain describes a diagnosis of cancer, staging, and 
characteristics of the tumor. The lab/vital domain in-
cludes laboratory results and vital signs relevant to can-
cer care. The genomics domain is crucial for the current 
oncology and includes data on biomarkers and genetic 
alterations. The treatment domain details surgeries, ra-
diation therapy, and systemic treatments. Finally, the 
outcome domain includes data on disease status, pro-
gression, and patient-reported outcomes [5].
For mCODE, each domain is made up of numerous 
concepts that then have data elements linked with it. 
For example, in the Treatment domain, there are con-
cepts on Cancer-Related Medication Statements and 
Procedure Statements. These are records of specific 
data elements, like the intent for treatment, such as 
curative or palliative, start and end dates of the drug, 
reasons to stop medicines; and more.
The structured nature of mCODE data elements, 
along with FHIR interoperability capabilities, allows 
efficacious collection, analysis, and sharing of data 
across institutions and research networks – tackling 
the largest issue in the oncological status quo.

The Applicability of LLM’s in Healthcare 
Standardization
In electronic health records (EHR), unstructured 
data comprises nearly 80% of the total information in 
a healthcare operation’s data set. This is because many 
clinical procedures and findings, such as physician 
notes, radiology reports, and pathology findings, are 
often maintained in their original unstructured form 
[6]. Despite its inherent complexity, this unstructured 
data holds valuable information that can significant-
ly advance cancer research and patient care. These 
sources provide crucial details about a patient’s medi-
cal history, treatment responses, and disease progres-
sion, which are indispensable for developing person-
alized treatment plans and conducting research into 
novel therapies. 
Standardized data plays a critical role in achieving 
consistent results and ensures the seamless integra-
tion of data from diverse sources, thereby fostering 
collaborative research initiatives. The challenge of 
converting unstructured data to a structured format 
is significant, especially in specialized domains like 
cancer, where medical terminology and concepts are 
highly specific. The topic of data standardization from 
clinical notes largely revolves around the concept of 
information extraction, which inherently includes 
term extraction, relation extraction, and the natural 
language processing (NLP) techniques associated 
with these tasks. Conventional NLP methodologies 
often rely on manually curated rules and human-
annotated datasets for their training procedures. This 
results in named entity recognition (NER) or infor-
mation extraction systems being less generalizable, 
thereby exhibiting limited portability.
Hence, this paper offers a novel framework to not 
only streamline this process and mitigate error, but 
also effectively increase the interoperability of on-
cological data around the world and offer the long-
awaited care many constituents around the world 
deserve. To achieve such, we utilize LLM’s, namely 
OpenAI’s GPT 4.0, to translate free-text and unstruc-
tured information, whether that be clinical-notes or 
patient variables organized in a PDF/JSON format, 
to manually format and create a completed and com-
pliant FHIR profile for the respective patient. With 
the respective FHIR profile, we deploy the LLM to 
break it down into the 6 respective mCODE profiles 
mentioned in section B. Once broken down, we in-
tegrate these 6 unique domains into an open-source 
framework intended for integrated trial matching, to 
streamline and strengthen the process of matching 
patients with the most effective trials to increase pro-
gressive cancer research in the status quo.
Methods and Model Framework/Design
This section delineates our multifaceted approach 
to enhancing oncology data standardization and in-
teroperability. We explore the integration of synthetic 
data generation, FHIR profile implementation, and 
mCODE standards. Our methodology encompasses 
the training and guidance of Large Language Mod-
els (LLMs) for processing free-text and generating 
FHIR profiles, alongside the 
development of mechanisms 
for storing and categorizing 
these profiles within mCODE 
domains. 
Throughout this segment, 
this paper effectively outlines 
approaches from development 
of patient profiles to accuracy 
assessment protocols using 
FHIR frameworks while dis-

cuss all of their interpretative significance. This com-
prehensive framework aims to address the critical 
challenges in healthcare informatics identified in our 
introduction. 
Visualization of Free-Text/Unstructured 
Data and FHIR Profiles
Free-text data refers to narrative text that clinician’s 
input into electronic health records (EHRs) without 
any predefined structure. This form of unstructured 
data often includes patient histories, clinical notes, 
discharge summaries, and other narrative descrip-
tions. Unstructured data is the most abundant source 
of unstructured healthcare industry because it pro-
vides clinicians with flexibility and ease to record de-
tailed and nuanced patient information [7].
The conversion of free-text data into structured 
formats is a critical step in developing a comprehen-
sive FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resourc-
es) mCODE (minimal Common Oncology Data Ele-
ments) profile. This profile standardizes oncology data 
elements to enhance data interoperability, enabling 
better data sharing, analysis, and clinical decision-
making. Nevertheless, the unstructured (free-text) 
nature of free text data presents utilization challenges 
due to its inherent non-standardized format that is not 
easily integrated across different healthcare systems.
Transforming free-text data into structured for-
mats involves the application of natural language 
processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques 
to extract key medical concepts and translate them 
into standardized data elements. Hence the usage and 
development of our GPT-trained LLM to transform 
the respective free-text and unstructured data. Such 
structured data can be converted to conforming FHIR 
mCODE profile, which ensures that vital patient in-
formation is suitably defined and readily shareable 
across those platforms and stakeholders.
The benefits of converting unstructured free-text

data into structured formats are manifold. It enhances 
the quality and accessibility of patient data, facilitates 
more effective data analytics, and improves clinical 
decision-making. Moreover, structured data is cru-
cial for achieving true interoperability in the health-
care industry, as it allows for seamless data exchange, 
reducing redundancies and improving care coordi-
nation. By starting with the conversion of free-text 
data, healthcare providers can take a significant step 
towards achieving the comprehensive and interop-
erable patient records envisioned by FHIR mCODE 
standards.
Process of Training/Guiding LLM to 
Translate Free-Text Data Into FHIR Profiles
The translation of free-text data, including clinical 
notes to a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Re-
sources) compliant patient profile is processed in mul-
tiple steps which aim at transforming unstructured 
clinical information into structured and interoper-
able formats. The methodology, which uses complex 
natural language processing (NLP) algorithms in 
conjunction with standardized coding systems and 
thorough validation proce-
dures to ensure the quality 
of FHIR profiles for integra-
tion within electronic health 
record (EHR) environments 
and other healthcare data ex-
change services [8].
The initial step in this pro-
cess involves the acquisition 
and preparation of free-text 
and unstructured clinical data. This data is typically 
available in various formats such as PDF documents, 
text files, or direct inputs from clinical documenta-
tion systems. The primary objective of the preparation 
phase is to preprocess the data, which involves cleans-
ing and structuring the text to facilitate efficient infor-
mation extraction. This includes removing irrelevant 
information, such as administrative data or extrane-
ous comments, and normalizing text by correcting 
typographical errors and standardizing abbreviations 
and acronyms. This preprocessing ensures that the 
focus remains on clinically relevant content, thereby 
enhancing the accuracy of subsequent NLP tasks.
Following data preparation, advanced natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) techniques are employed to 
interpret and extract structured information from the 
free-text clinical notes. This phase is crucial as it bridg-
es the gap between unstructured text and structured 
data. NLP tools, including Named Entity Recognition 
(NER) models, are utilized to identify and categorize 
key medical entities such as patient demographics, 
clinical conditions, medications, procedures, obser-
vations, and outcomes. These models were trained

on large medical corpora capturing of the relevant 
knowledge, which helps in recognition and segmenta-
tion of specific terms with clinical notes. Syntactic and 
semantic parsing techniques also provide the ability to 
interpret relationships of entities with each other so 
that a complete data extraction can be achieved.
Once the structured data elements are extracted, 
they are meticulously mapped to corresponding FHIR 
resources. The patient resource captures demographic 
information, including identifiers, names, gender, 
birth date, and contact details, ensuring a complete 
patient profile. Clinical conditions and diagnoses are 
represented using the Condition resource, capturing 
essential details such as the onset date, verification 
status, and clinical status. The MedicationRequest 
resource is used 
to document pre-
scribed 
medica-
tions, including the 
medication 
code, 
dosage, and admin-
istration 
instruc-
tions, while the Ob-
servation resource 
encodes 
clinical 
observations, 
lab 
results, and imag-
ing findings. The 
Procedure resource 
documents clinical 
procedures and in-
terventions, specifying the procedure type, date, and 
outcome, and the AllergyIntolerance resource records 
any known allergies and adverse reactions, including 
substance, reaction, and severity.
To ensure interoperability, the extracted data elements 
are mapped to standardized terminologies and coding 
systems. SNOMED CT is used for diagnoses and clinical 
findings, LOINC for lab results and observations, ICD-
10 for disease classification, and RxNorm for medication 
identification. Integrating these standardized codes into 
the FHIR resources facilitates consistent interpretation 
and exchange of clinical information across different 
healthcare systems. This step involves cross-referencing 
the extracted terms with standardized vocabularies and 
ensuring accurate coding.

The individual FHIR resources are then combined 
into a FHIR Bundle, which encapsulates all related 
resources, presenting them as a cohesive patient pro-
file. This “document” or “collection” bundle stores the 
patient’s clinical information in a comprehensive and 
readily transferable way. The bundling process in-
volves assembling the resources in a logical sequence, 
establishing relationships between them, and ensur-
ing that all necessary references are correctly resolved.
Restructuring FHIR Profiles for mCODE 
Compliant Data Structures	
The primary step in effectively converting a FHIR 
profile into mCODE compliant data, and improving 
interoperability of oncology patients’ data is to be ex-
tract data from the original FHIR profile. This infor-
mation contains patient demographics, cancer diag-
noses, treatments given (if any), observations made, 
and procedures performed. Some of these natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) tools help in this extraction 
and to not miss any important clinical details. Then, 
the data is normalized from its original clinical coding 
systems and value sets to those required by mCODE 
(e.g., SNOMED CT for conditions, LOINC for labora-
tory tests, RxNorm for medications) [9].
After normalizing, data is assigned to the mCODE 
profiles. For example, patient demographic informa-
tion will create the mCODE Patient profile but with 
a guarantee that all required identifiers and contact 
details are included in this structure. Cancer diagno-
ses are given as the mCODE CancerCondition profile, 
which contains clinical status and verification status 
along with diagnosis codes. Similarly, medications are 
mapped to the mCODE profile for medications, and 
observations or procedures will also map to their cor-
responding mCODE profiles. Following mapping, the 
mCODE profiles are rigorously vetted using tailored 
validation mechanisms to confirm implementation 
aligns with specifications laid out in mCODE. Integ-
rity Test - This validates detailed integrity and accu-
racy of data to ensure that they are complete, correctly 
coded with the correct structure. The profiles are then 
reviewed by clinical and technical stakeholders for ac-
curacy and relevance.
Results and Validation of Large 
Language Model Outputs 
Towards 
FHIR and mCODE Profiles
This section presents the results of converting free-
text clinical notes into structured FHIR profiles and 
transforming these profiles into mCODE-compliant 
formats. Using advanced natural language processing 
(NLP) techniques and large language models (LLMs), 
clinical information was accurately extracted from 
unstructured data.The subsequent transformation 
aligned these FHIR profiles with mCODE standards, 
adapting the data to fit within the oncology-specific 
framework. 
This process involved rigorous validation to main-
tain data integrity and fidelity. Additionally we vali-
date the accuracy of these results(FHIR and mCODE 
profiles) by placing them within open-source FHIR 
servers and tools like the FHIR R4 Validator for Con-
formance to determine how accurate our unique 
LLM-produced profiles are to those that are officially 
implemented within the industry [10]. The reasoning 
behind this method of validation is due to the intri-
cacy of testing LLM accuracy without causing lapses 
in judgement for the LLM whilst creating profiles. 
Hence, exporting profiles to external serves and vali-
dators is the most effective way of measuring efficacy/
accuracy from the model.
Mapping and Processing Free-Text Data 
(e.g. Clinical Notes) to LLM’s as FHIR 
Profiles
Methodology of Pre-Processing Respective Free-
Text Dataset: A multi-step, systematic approach us-
ing sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) 
and data structuring techniques was applied to enrich 
detailed FHIR profiles directly from the raw free-text 
clinical note for a leukemia patient. The clinical note 
(flow cytometry test details, specimen description 
and diagnostic interpretation) was first pre-processed 
meticulously. The purpose of this phase was to extract 
and classify the unstructured text, highlighting im-
portant medical concepts or entities. This included the 
extraction and categorization of terms such as “Mixed 
OR#3 – LLM DRIVEN MCODE DATA MODEL IN ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
32
Lymphoid Expansion”, “Peripheral Blood” and, “’84% 
viability’” by level of clinical relevance.
Following pre-processing, the next step involved 
mapping the extracted information to appropriate 
FHIR resources. The diagnostic report was translated 
into a `DiagnosticReport` resource, capturing the es-
sential details such as the test type (Flow Cytometry), 
the clinical indication (D72.819), and the interpreta-
tion (“NO CLONAL LYMPHOID POPULATION 
DETECTED”). This resource was carefully structured 
to include relevant metadata, such as the collection 
and reporting dates, ensuring comprehensive docu-
mentation of the diagnostic process. The `Observa-
tion` resource was used to detail specific findings 
from the flow cytometry, such as the proportion of 
lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes, ensuring 
each observation was accurately encoded with stan-
dard terminologies.
The `Specimen` resource was created to encap-
sulate the sample’s details, including the specimen 
source (Peripheral Blood) and viability percentage 
(84%). This resource was enriched with precise in-
formation on the sample’s composition, such as the 
proportions of lymphocytes, monocytes, and granu-
locytes. Each data point from the clinical note was 
meticulously mapped to corresponding fields within 
the `Specimen` resource, ensuring a high level of ac-
curacy and completeness.
Furthermore, the process involved validating the 
structured FHIR profiles against HL7-FHIR standards 
to ensure they adhered to interoperability guidelines. 
This validation step was crucial in maintaining data 
integrity and ensuring the profiles could be seamlessly 
integrated into broader healthcare systems.
Mapping/Processing Generated 
FHIR Profiles to LLMs for 
mCODE Conversion
We initiated our process with a comprehensive 
mapping between FHIR resources and mCODE ele-
ments, guided by the mCODE Implementation Guide. 
This mapping identified direct correspondences and 
areas requiring extension. For instance, in translating 
a DiagnosticReport resource to the mCODE cancer-
diagnostic-report profile, we meticulously aligned ele-
ments such as status, category, and code with mCODE 
specifications. The category coding for Hematology” 
(HM) and the LOINC code “55233-1” for the Leuke-
mia/Lymphoma Panel were precisely mapped to en-
sure semantic consistency.
For oncology-specific concepts not natively rep-
resented in FHIR, we developed custom extensions. 
These extensions were designed to capture the granu-
larity required by mCODE while adhering to FHIR’s 
extensibility principles. In the case of genomic data 
elements, crucial for comprehensive oncological pro-
filing, we created extensions that could encapsulate

33
complex information such as biomarker status and ge-
nomic variants. This approach allowed us to represent 
vital data that might be derived from the leukemia/
lymphoma panel results, ensuring it was accurately 
captured within the mCODE framework [11].
Our process also accounted for the temporal and 
provenance aspects crucial in oncology care. The ef-
fectiveDateTime and issued fields in the Diagnos-
ticReport were carefully preserved in the mCODE 
profile, maintaining the critical timeline of diagnostic 
events. Furthermore, we ensured that references to re-
lated resources, such as the performing clinician, the 
patient, and associated specimens and observations, 
were accurately translated to maintain the integrity of 
the clinical narrative within the mCODE structure.
Training and Evaluation of Accuracy Rates 
via Large Language Models

ing a language model (LLM) to accurately gen-
erate FHIR and mCODE profiles. When analyz-

34
ing and utilizing results provided form an LLM, it’s 
imperative to determine the results abide to highly-
measured accuracy rates. This starts, by providing our 
LLM with over 70 patient profiles and converting each 
one to both FHIR and mCODE compliant formats. 
Whilst doing this, our LLM monitored and stored 
patterns to continue to look for when both analyzing 
free-text data such as clinical notes, but also in terms 
of producing patient profiles. 
By incorporating a variety of clinical variables 
such as cancer types, diagnosis dates, metastasis in-
dications, staging information, histology grades, and 
laterality, the dataset allows the LLM to understand 
and classify these variables with precision. This classi-
fication process is crucial for ensuring that the gener-
ated profiles accurately reflect a patient’s clinical data. 
For instance, the LLM learns that “Bone/Soft Tissue 
Cancer” corresponds to a specific cancer diagnosis 
and that “Head/Neck” represents a metastasis site, en-
abling it to populate the correct FHIR elements such 
as Condition. code and Observation.value Codeable 
Concept.
Mapping these clinical variables to FHIR elements 
is a significant step facilitated by the dataset. Each en-
try guides the LLM on how to structure data within 
FHIR profiles. For example, staging information like 
“TX, T0, Tis, T1” is mapped to FHIR Observation. 
code and Observation. value Codeable Concept, en-
suring consistency and accuracy. The dataset’s stan-
dardized terminologies and values, sourced from 
master CRFs, help the LLM maintain compatibility 
with global healthcare standards. This standardiza-
tion is vital for generating both FHIR and mCODE 
profiles, as it ensures that elements such as cancer 
diagnosis dates (Observation.effectiveDateTime) and 
metastasis indications (Condition.extension) are ac-
curately encoded.
The structured nature of the dataset also plays a 
critical role in mitigating errors. By providing clear 
delineations of variables and their values, the dataset

sands of Unstructured Raw Datasets

35
reduces ambiguity and enhances the LLM’s accuracy 
in generating profiles. This structured approach is 
particularly beneficial when dealing with data from 
multiple sources, such as PDFs and progress notes, as 
it allows the LLM to extract and standardize relevant 
information effectively.
Accuracy Rates of LLM-Generated mCODE 
Resources within FHIR Profiles – A Trial 
versus Trial Comparison
The model predicted the correct SNOMED-CT, 
LOINC code in 87% of the raw data and 90% of the 
standard data by test frequency and around 84% for 
RxNorm. In the subset of raw data where the origi-
nal and model-predicted LOINC codes disagreed, the 
model-predicted LOINC code was correct in 85% of 
the data by test frequency. There is an opportunity to 
improve around generic medication and raw results 
and clinical data by training the model with smaller 
data set. mCODE conformance improved in Series 
3 with profile interoperability compliance coming 
around 92%.
Additionally, it is important to draw upon the ob-
servation that throughout the 3 separate trials(series) 
performed via our Large Language Model, accuracy 
rates continued to see a constant increase. However, 
regardless of the digital recourse being measured, 
accuracy rates saw an increase between trials, hence 
demonstrating our model learning from itself. How-
ever, it is also important to look at the larger impact.
The impact of these accuracy rates on clinical prac-
tice and research is significant. High accuracy in cod-
ing ensures that healthcare providers have access to 
precise and standardized information, which is vital 
for patient safety, accurate diagnosis, and effective 
treatment planning. Improved mCODE conformance 
and profile interoperability compliance at 92% indi-
cate that our model supports oncology data standards 
effectively, facilitating better data sharing and integra-
tion in cancer care. This revolutionary accuracy, com-
pletely redefines the status quo with other LLM’s such 
as GPT-4 and Claude averaging between 77-80%. This 
high level of conformance is particularly important 
for advancing precision medicine and enabling re-
searchers to draw more accurate insights from aggre-
gated health data [12].
Development of an Integrated 
Clinical Trial Matching Engine 
for Oncology Patients Using LLM 
Produced FHIR Resources and 
mCODE Profiles
The integration of clinical trial matching services 
with electronic health records (EHRs) and patient 
data repositories leverages advanced data standards 
like FHIR and specialized oncology profiles such as 
mCODE. This integration holds the potential to sig-
nificantly enhance the precision and efficiency of

Resources per Dataset of Thousands of Profiles

36
matching patients to appropriate clinical trials, there-
by optimizing therapeutic outcomes and advancing 
personalized medicine.
In the context of oncology, clinical trial match-
ing is particularly crucial. Cancer treatment often 
requires highly personalized approaches due to the 
variability in tumor biology and patient response to 
therapies. Traditional methods of clinical trial enroll-
ment are frequently manual, time-consuming, and 
reliant on limited patient data, which can result in 
missed opportunities for patients to participate in tri-
als that might offer them the best possible treatment. 
By utilizing mCODE, a standardized data model that 
captures essential oncology data elements, alongside 
FHIR, which facilitates the seamless exchange of 
healthcare information, we can automate and stream-
line this matching process. This ensures that compre-
hensive and precise patient data is readily available for 
matching algorithms, leading to more accurate identi-
fication of suitable clinical trials for patients.
Hence, the use of mCODE profiles as mentioned 
throughout the earlier portions of this paper, en-
sures that critical cancer-specific data elements such 
as tumor characteristics, treatment history, genomic 
information, and patient outcomes are consistently 
captured and structured. When this standardized 
data is made interoperable through FHIR, it can be 
easily shared across various platforms and systems, 
including clinical trial databases. This interoperabil-
ity not only accelerates the matching process but also 
improves the accuracy and relevance of matches. Pa-
tients can be matched to trials that are tailored to their 
unique clinical and genetic profiles, thus increasing 
the likelihood of trial success and contributing to the 
broader goals of precision oncology.
Development of a Framework for 
Proactive and Efficient Integrated 
Clinical Trial Matching for 
Cancer Patients
The provided framework represents a comprehen-
sive and systematic approach to leveraging mCODE 
FHIR profiles for clinical trial matching, underscoring 
its feasibility and integration with existing healthcare 
systems. This framework starts with the extraction of 
detailed patient treatment data, encapsulated within 
mCODE profiles, which include expanded data ele-
ments pertinent to oncology. The mCODE profiles 
are derived from standard mCODE profiles, enriched 
as needed to ensure all relevant patient information is 
captured accurately – this process was demonstrated

tients with mCODE Profiles Produced via LLM Model

above in the methodology of translating profiles from 
free-text data into FHIR mCODE profiles. This en-
riched data serves as a robust foundation for identify-
ing clinical trial matches, ensuring that the patient’s 
unique clinical characteristics and treatment history 
are fully considered.
In the framework, patient treatment data is first 
retrieved and transformed into mCODE profiles. 
These profiles, adhering to FHIR standards, facilitate 
seamless data exchange and interoperability, a critical 
aspect for integrating with third-party trial matching 
services. The use of FHIR ensures that the data is in a 
standardized format, making it compatible with vari-
ous health information systems and databases. Once 
the mCODE++ profiles are prepared, they are trans-
mitted to clinical trial matching algorithms, which 
analyze the profiles against a database of available 
clinical trials. This step is crucial as it leverages ad-
vanced computational methods to identify the most 
suitable trials for each patient based on their specific 
clinical attributes.
The framework’s integration with third-party trial 
matching services further enhances its utility. These 
services utilize the mCODE profiles to generate linked 
trial matches, providing detailed information on rel-
evant clinical trials that align with the patient’s profile. 
Our third-party clinical trial matching engine by us-
ing a SMART on FHIR application (FHIR guidelines 
for apps) that sends relevant patient data derived from 
mCODE and FHIR profiles and returns uniform re-
sults [13]. Our specific clinical trial matching engine 
utilized a backend library that was constructed to 
provide a generic shell for services to connect to a 
behind-the-scenes trial matching service and engine. 
To accomplish such, our matching engine receives a 
FHIR bundle of resources as provided from the FHIR 
and mCODE profiles generated above in sections 1-3. 
Our engine then consequently uses those resources 
derived from the profiles to generate a FHIR search 
result that contains FHIR ResearchStudy(similar to 
any other variable/object that comprises a FHIR and 
mCODE profile) objects that describe matching clini-
cal trials. However, on the other hand, now that we 
have discussed how the back-end works, let’s discuss 
the imperative front-end services. 
In regard to the front-end services of our clinical 
trial matching engine, we use a TrialScope Wrapper 
that calls TrialScope’s API for the front end of clinical 
matching service, to help patients, hospitals, and doc-
tors interact with the service by inputting their own 
profiles, customizing and filtering services, etc. [14]. 
As previously mentioned, our backend services break 
down the FHIR profile, similar to a reverse method-
ology of our free-text data to mCODE conversion.

ability Across Platforms/Providers

38
Because of this, our service breaks down the FHIR 
profile back into free-text data and variables, however, 
to implement a mechanism to find associated clini-
cal trials with these profiles we rely on a third-party 
server, namely – BreastCancerTrials. This third-party 
tool is integrated into our system to be able to send 
queries from our service to the breastcancertrials.org 
clinical trial search service [15].
The framework supports the continuous flow of 
information, where clinical trial matches are fed 
back into the system, allowing healthcare providers 
to present patients with up-to-date and precise trial 
options. This iterative process not only enhances the 
accuracy of trial matching but also ensures that pa-
tients are consistently presented with the best possible 
treatment opportunities. The feasibility and effective-
ness of this framework lie in its adherence to FHIR 
standards and the comprehensive nature of mCODE 
profiles. 
Demonstration of Integrated Clinical 
Trial Matching Service and Respective 
Breakdown of Engine Results/Trial Outputs
The integrated clinical trial matching service le-
verages mCODE FHIR profiles to deliver highly 
personalized and relevant clinical trial matches for 
patients, particularly those battling cancer. This is 
exemplified in the provided screenshot, which shows 
a breast cancer patient matched with a clinical trial 
studying the molecular mechanisms of clinical re-
sistance to targeted therapy. This matching process 
is immensely beneficial for patients, as it provides 
them with opportunities to participate in cutting-
edge research that might offer new treatment options 
when and where standard therapies have failed. The 
likelihood of a match is determined by analyzing de-
tailed patient data encapsulated in mCODE profiles, 
ensuring that the trials they are matched with are 
highly pertinent to their specific clinical character-
istics and needs.
For cancer patients, this system can be a lifeline. 
The matching service not only identifies suitable tri-
als but also streamlines the process of enrollment, 
allowing patients to access potentially life-saving 
treatments more quickly. The trial highlighted in the 
screenshot below, conducted by the Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center, aims to understand why 
tumors become resistant to therapy. Such research is 
crucial for developing new strategies to overcome re-
sistance and improve patient outcomes. By participat-
ing in their own respective studies and clinical trials 
patients contribute to valuable scientific knowledge 
while also receiving cutting-edge care that may offer

better therapeutic results compared to existing treat-
ment options.
Healthcare providers and researchers benefit sig-
nificantly from this integrated trial matching service. 
It enhances the efficiency of clinical trial recruitment, 
ensuring that eligible patients are quickly and accu-
rately identified. This reduces the time, and resources 
spent on finding suitable participants, allowing re-
searchers to focus more on conducting the trial and 
less on recruitment logistics. Additionally, the stan-
dardized nature of mCODE FHIR profiles ensures 
interoperability across various health information 
systems, facilitating seamless data exchange and col-
laboration. This integrated approach not only accel-
erates the pace of clinical re-
search but also improves the 
quality and relevance of trial 
outcomes, ultimately leading 
to advancements in cancer 
treatment and patient care.

Discussion and Final Conclusions 
Our research leverages HL7-FHIR (Fast Health-
care Interoperability Resources) to address signifi-
cant challenges in healthcare data interoperability. 
In this study, we implemented FHIR to streamline 
data exchange processes and enhance the integration 
of electronic health records (EHRs) across diverse 
healthcare systems. This implementation facilitated 
seamless communication between disparate systems, 
enabling accurate sharing of patient information [16].
A key aspect of our work involved the use of 
FHIR’s resource-based approach to manage patient 
data. Each piece of information, such as allergy lists 
and medication histories, was treated as a discrete re-
source. This modular approach enabled the software 
to provide a very structured means of sharing data 
and prevented data mismatch or errors. In the case of 
the present research, this capability was essential in 
designing a system which would allow for changes in 
clinical practice while not requiring extensive modifi-
cations. Moreover, they implemented FHIR using the 
modern web technologies such as RESTful API, JSON 
and XML.
Concerning patient centricity, the current study 
also sought to establish what FHIR meant for patient 
orientation. We created patient’s portals and applica-
tions that applied FHIR to enhance the patients’ un-
derstanding of their data. This empowered patients 
to transfer their information to various care givers 
hence integration of care. For instance, patient migra-
tion meant that records could easily be transferred to 
new caregivers thus improving theMedical history of 
a patient. By developing this portal, this paper revo-
lutionized access to custom care for cancer patients 
around the world. Achieving a 92% accraucy rate in 
profile accuracy, this paper trumps current solutions 
in the status quo and paves a new path for cancer care 
around the world.
Further, this explored the application of FHIR in the 
enhancement of other progressive forms of healthcare 
like clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and pre-
cision medications. Based on precision medicine, we 
explained how FHIR could help reconcile genomic in-
formation with conventional clinical data for tailored 
treatment plans based on a patient’s genetic makeup.
Future research opportunities for follow-up re-
search based on this work are the development of of 
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 
based application on FHIR. The normalization of data 
for feeding to AI models can result into delivering 
of analytical tools for early warning of likely patient 
complications and direction of resources towards 
more likely complications among the patient popula-
tion. Also, understanding FHIR capabilities regard-
ing enhancing international interoperability of the 
healthcare system is highly important regarding the 
contemporary threats that affect global health such as 
pandemics. 
In conclusion, by utilizing FHIR’s standardized 
protocols and modular architecture, we achieved 
significant improvements in data exchange, patient-
centric care, and advanced healthcare applications. 
Our findings underscore the potential of FHIR to 
transform healthcare systems, and we encourage fur-
ther research to explore and expand its capabilities, 
fostering a more connected, efficient, and innovative 
healthcare ecosystem [17].
