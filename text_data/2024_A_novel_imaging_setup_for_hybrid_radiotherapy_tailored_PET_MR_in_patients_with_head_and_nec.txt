A novel imaging setup for hybrid radiotherapy tailored PET/MR in 
patients with head and neck cancer 
 
Abstract 
Purpose: Radiotherapy commonly relies on CT, but there is growing interest in using hybrid 
PET/MR. Therefore, dedicated hardware setups have been proposed for PET/MR systems 
which enable imaging in radiotherapy treatment position. These radiotherapy setups typically 
include a flat tabletop, positioning tools and coil holders specifically tailored to the devices. 
However, reduced MR image quality has been reported. Especially in neck and upper thorax, 
conventional radiotherapy setups are not optimal as they consist of head-only coil 
configurations. The purpose was to develop a novel PET/MR radiotherapy setup for improved 
MR image quality in head, neck and thorax and to test compliance in a multicenter setting. 
Methods: A novel radiotherapy setup was designed, prototyped and tested on a 3T PET/MR 
system in three different centers. Imaging experiments were conducted in phantoms and 
healthy volunteers to compare against a standard radiotherapy setup. Imaging protocols 
included T1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted MR (DWI). Finally, compliance with American 
College of Radiology (ACR) and the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance (QIBA) 
acceptance criteria was evaluated. 
Results: SNR in neck/thorax was increased by a factor of 1.6 in phantom (p = 0.031) and 
volunteer images alike. The new setup passed ACR detectability and QIBA SNR tests, which 
the standard setup failed. The new setup passed all but two ACR test criteria in the three 
centers, presented repeatability and reproducibility variations of 4.9% and 7.8% and met all 
QIBA criteria for DWI except ADC precision. 
Conclusion: The proposed setup yielded significantly higher SNR, better detectability, and 
complied with nearly all ACR and QIBA image quality criteria. It may thus advance the usage 
of PET/MR for radiotherapy purposes.

1. Introduction 
Image-guidance in radiotherapy is conventionally based on X-ray computed tomography 
(CT), but the interest in integrating positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic 
resonance (MR) imaging is steadily growing (1–3). This is especially the case for head and 
neck cancer, where the response to radiotherapy is still resulting in high rates of loco-regional 
recurrence, and early and late side-effects (4). PET and MR are attractive modalities to guide 
and ultimately improve radiotherapy by providing high soft tissue contrast and structural 
information combined with multidimensional functional information, for example on tumor 
glucose metabolism (5), hypoxia (6) or diffusion (7). Studies have shown that such data can 
be highly valuable for a wide range of radiotherapy tasks such as target volume delineation 
(8,9), treatment response assessment (10), outcome prediction (11), patient stratification (12) 
and the development of imaging biomarkers for treatment adaptation (13,14).  
The many potential applications make hybrid PET/MR, where PET and MR are combined in 
a single system and data can be acquired simultaneously, a highly promising modality for 
radiotherapy (15–18). In particular, recent advances in machine learning and artificial 
intelligence have led to the possibility of MR-only based radiotherapy workflows where an 
MR-derived synthetic CT replaces the traditional CT for radiotherapy planning and dose 
calculation (19,20). This elicits an enormous potential to advance the role of hybrid PET/MR 
to a one-stop shop for radiotherapy planning, as Olin et al. (21) and Ahangari et al. (22) 
recently demonstrated in head/neck and cervical cancer. 
However, imaging for radiotherapy purposes requires positioning the patient for the imaging 
examination in the same way as for the radiation treatment (23). This involves the use of 
dedicated positioning hardware such as a flat tabletop and, for patients with head and neck 
cancer, head, neck and shoulder mask fixation devices and positioning aids. A special coil 
setup should snugly fit the radiotherapy equipment, so typically flexible body matrix coils are 
used. Achieving good MR image quality with such radiotherapy-tailored imaging setup on a 
hybrid PET/MR system is challenging. The coils should not be positioned directly on the 
patient in order to avoid deformation of the body anatomy for dose planning. In addition, 
since both the radiotherapy hardware and the MR coil setup attenuate the PET signal, 
predefined attenuation maps of the hardware should be stored on the system for the specific 
hardware location, and be used for PET signal attenuation correction (24). This demands a 
reproducible setup design with coil holders or coil bridges where the coils are more distant to 
the patient than during diagnostic scans. This impacts MR image quality (18,25,26). Different 
5 
 
setup designs have been proposed for different PET/MR systems (21,27–31) and reductions in 
MR signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the range of 25% to 46% have been reported (27–30). 
Reduced MR image quality in terms of low-contrast object detectability scores have been 
documented (30). Two radiotherapy setups have been proposed specifically for imaging 
patients with head and neck cancer (21,27,28,31). However, the setup designs leave room for 
improvement for acquiring high-quality MR images in the neck and upper thorax region. This 
is particularly relevant for treatment planning of laryngopharyngeal cancer or lymph node 
metastases. The currently available setups all consist of a head-only coil setup used for both 
head, neck and thorax. An additional flex coil can be added for neck/thorax by placing it 
directly on the patient, but then the coil will not be correctable in PET signal attenuation 
correction (21). Other radiotherapy setups have been proposed for pelvic or whole-body 
imaging which might in principle be suitable to image head/neck and thorax (29,32), but 
feasibility and compatibility with neck and shoulder mask fixation has not been studied. 
Therefore, we developed a novel radiotherapy prototype setup for clinical PET/MR imaging 
facilitating better MR SNR and image quality in neck and thorax, without making 
compromises in radiotherapy mask fixation or reproducible hardware positioning. The 
purpose was to advance PET/MR-based treatment planning and quantitative imaging 
biomarkers. The primary aim was to systematically investigate the MR image quality with 
this novel prototype setup in comparison to a typical head-only radiotherapy setup.  
Multicenter trials are essential in the development of imaging biomarkers for personalized 
treatment of cancer but the use of different imaging systems may add variation to the imaging 
performance (33). To our knowledge, multicenter trials investigating MR image quality in 
radiotherapy imaging setups on hybrid PET/MR systems do not exist. Therefore, it was a 
second aim to test compliance of MR image quality with the prototype setup across different 
institutions. 
 
2. Material and methods 
Study design 
A novel radiotherapy setup was designed and prototyped in collaboration with Medibord 
Limited (Nottingham, UK), and tested in three different centers in Norway: University 
Hospital of North Norway in Tromsø (center 1), St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim (center 2), 
and Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen (center 3). All three centers are part of a 
multicenter imaging trial in head and neck cancer (EMINENCE trial, clinicaltrials.gov no. 
6 
 
NCT04612075). Scans were performed on a 3T PET/MR system (Biograph mMR, Siemens 
Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). Each PET/MR system was equipped with two 
radiotherapy setups: the novel prototype setup featuring an extended head/neck/thorax coil 
configuration, and a standard setup featuring a head-only coil configuration (Medibord).    
To analyze the MR image quality with the new prototype setup, the study was divided into 
four parts. First, measurements were performed in one center with both prototype and 
standard setup using the large American College of Radiology (ACR) phantom. The aim was 
to investigate whether the prototype setup offers better SNR and image quality in neck and 
thorax positions compared to the standard setup, and whether it fulfills the acceptance criteria 
of the ACR society. Second, monthly ACR phantom tests were performed with the prototype 
setup in one center over three months to determine repeatability. Replicate measurements 
were made in the other two centers to investigate the intercenter reproducibility. Third, test 
measurements with the prototype and standard setups were performed in one center using the  
Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance (QIBA) diffusion phantom (QalibreMD Diffusion 
Standard Model 128, High Precision Devices, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA). The aim was to 
investigate the quality of DWI in a neck position, and to test compliance with the quality 
acceptance criteria of the QIBA society. Last, clinical feasibility of the prototype setup was 
tested in healthy volunteers. 
 
Experimental setups 
The standard head-only radiotherapy setup consisted of a flat tabletop, a set of two head coil 
holders with two 6-channel mMR body matrix coils, and a baseplate for thermoplastic mask 
fixation (Figure 1a-d). The tabletop placement allows for using the system’s spine coil array 
for posterior neck/thorax coverage. The new prototype setup consists of the same tabletop, 
head coil and baseplate setup, but in addition, a novel arc-shaped coil bridge was developed 
for using a third body matrix coil for the anterior neck and thorax (Figure 1e-f). The 
neck/thorax coil bridge was designed with low photon attenuation and to be compatible with 
the baseplate and head, neck and shoulder mask fixation devices, while providing 
reproducible coil and holder positioning for PET signal attenuation correction. The spine coil 
array can still be used for posterior neck/thorax signal coverage. 
 
ACR image quality tests 
To investigate the potential benefit of the novel prototype setup compared to the standard 
setup, MR test measurements were performed with both setups in one center (center 1) using 
7 
 
the ACR phantom. The experimental setups are depicted in Supplementary Figure 1a-b. The 
ACR phantom is a hollow cylinder of acrylic plastic (length, 148 mm; diameter, 190 mm) 
filled with a nickel chloride and sodium chloride solution. It contains different structures 
designed to facilitate a variety of scanner performance tests. For the first set of MR test scans, 
a sagittal localizer and T1-weighted spin-echo (T1w) sequence were used and sequence 
parameters were set according to the ACR guidelines (acraccreditation.org). The tests 
comprised scans at 15 equidistant positions in superior-inferior (SI) direction to investigate 
the performance profile from head to thorax. The distance between positions was 4 cm. The 
mid position (0 cm) was set to the location of the patient’s chin, which is at the intersection of 
head and neck/thorax coil parts (Supplementary Figure 1c-d). Phantom positioning was 
controlled using the laser system of the PET/MR system. At the first five scan positions (brain 
to head), data were only acquired once with the head coil parts, as these are identical in both 
setups. At the last three thorax positions, scans with the standard setup were omitted, as the 
phantom would be placed too far outside the field-of-view of the head coils. 
MR image quality metrics were analyzed according to ACR guidelines: High-contrast spatial 
resolution in anterior-posterior (AP) and left-right (LR) direction, slice thickness accuracy, 
slice position accuracy, percent image intensity uniformity (PIU), low-contrast object 
detectability, percent-signal ghosting, and geometric accuracy. Geometric accuracy was 
evaluated based on the phantom dimensions (the phantom’s length in SI in the localizer, and 
diameter in AP, LR and diagonal directions in the T1w image). ACR criteria served as 
reference values. In addition, signal, noise and SNR were analyzed based on two repeat scans 
of the T1w image. An average signal image and a difference image (noise image) were 
calculated. Signal was defined as a region of interest (ROI)-based spatial mean pixel value in 
the average signal image, 𝑆̅𝑎𝑣𝑔−𝑖𝑚𝑎; noise as the ROI-based spatial standard deviation in the 
difference image, 𝜎𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓−𝑖𝑚𝑎, divided by √2. SNR was then calculated as:  
𝑆𝑁𝑅= √2 𝑆̅𝑎𝑣𝑔−𝑖𝑚𝑎
𝜎𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓−𝑖𝑚𝑎
.
(1) 
95% confidence intervals for signal and 𝑆𝑁𝑅 were estimated using the ROI based spatial 
standard deviation for signal, and error propagation for SNR. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
was used to evaluate whether differences in signal and SNR between prototype and standard 
setup were significant at the 5% level.

Repeatability and reproducibility 
ACR phantom measurements with the prototype setup were performed in one center (center 
2) once a month for a three-month period to determine the repeatability of MR image quality. 
A localizer, T1w, and T2w sequence were used. Sequence parameters were set according to 
the ACR guidelines. The phantom was positioned in center position (0 cm) simulating a 
typical head/neck bed position. The same image quality metrics as listed above were 
evaluated according to the ACR guidelines. Repeatability was quantified by the within-object 
standard deviation over the monthly repeats, 𝜎3𝑚, and interpreted relative to the ACR 
tolerance using a within-center coefficient of variation (wCV):  
𝑤𝐶𝑉= 100% 𝜎3𝑚
𝑐𝐴𝐶𝑅
,
(2) 
 
where 𝑐𝐴𝐶𝑅 is the ACR criterion of the test metric.   
ACR replicate measurements were made in the other two centers to investigate the intercenter 
reproducibility. Reproducibility was quantified by the standard deviation over the 
measurements in all three centers, 𝜎3𝑐, and interpreted relative to the ACR tolerance using an 
intercenter coefficient of variation (iCV): 
𝑖𝐶𝑉= 100% 𝜎3𝑐
𝑐𝐴𝐶𝑅
.

QIBA diffusion tests 
DWI measurements with both the prototype and standard setup were performed in one center 
(center 2) using the QIBA calibration phantom. The aim was to investigate the quality of 
DWI in a neck position (6 cm) using the prototype setup in comparison to the standard setup; 
and to investigate whether the prototype setup passes the QIBA acceptance criteria 
(qibawiki.rsna.org). The ice water cooled phantom contained vials of different media to allow 
the measurement of known apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC). A set of four repeat scans 
was performed with each setup using the QIBA benchmark protocol (single shot - echo planar 
imaging (SS-EPI); four b-values, 0, 500, 900, 2000 s/mm2; diffusion mode, 3-scan trace; 
acquisition, transverse; signal averages, 1; field of view (FOV), 216x216x125 mm3; slice 
thickness, 4 mm; spacing between slices, 5mm; repetition time (TR), 1000 ms; echo time 
(TE), 102 ms; pixel spacing, 1.125\1.125 mm). SNR in the DWI was analyzed based on the 
four repeat scans; an average signal image and a temporal noise image (temporal standard 
deviation across the four repeats) were calculated. SNR was derived as: 
9 
 
𝑆𝑁𝑅= 𝑆̅𝑎𝑣𝑔−𝑖𝑚𝑎
𝑁̅𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒−𝑖𝑚𝑎
,
(4) 
 
where 𝑆̅𝑎𝑣𝑔−𝑖𝑚𝑎, an ROI-based mean value in the average signal image, and 𝑁̅𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒−𝑖𝑚𝑎, an 
ROI-based mean value in the temporal noise image. 
ADC bias (measured minus true ADC), percentage bias (ADC bias/true ADC), precision 
(spatial coefficient of variation, CV), short-term repeatability (temporal within-object 
coefficient of variation, wCV), and b-value dependence for different b-value combinations 
were analyzed for the prototype setup. The ADC b-value dependence was calculated as: 
𝑏-𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒= |
𝐴𝐷𝐶𝑏0-𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥1 −𝐴𝐷𝐶𝑏0-𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥2
𝐴𝐷𝐶𝑏0-𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥1
| 100% ,
(5) 
 
where 𝐴𝐷𝐶𝑏0-𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥1 and 𝐴𝐷𝐶𝑏0-𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥2 are ADC values calculated from b-value combinations 
of 𝑏0 (0 s/mm2) and different 𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥 ( 𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥1, 𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥2 equal 500, 900, or 2000 s/mm2; while 
𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥1 ≠ 𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥2). All calculations were ROI-based and according to QIBA guidelines. 
Measurements and analysis were repeated with a clinical protocol for low distortion DWI 
(readout segmented EPI (RESOLVE); four b-values, 0, 50, 100, 800 s/mm2; diffusion mode, 
4-scan trace; acquisition, transverse; averages, 1; FOV, 216x216x125 mm3; slice thickness, 4 
mm; spacing between slices, 5 mm; TR, 4710 ms; TE, 73 ms; pixel spacing, 1.125/1.125 
mm).  
All image analysis was performed in Matlab r2020a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, 
USA).  
 
Volunteer test 
Two healthy volunteers underwent MR imaging after informed consent and in agreement with 
institutional ethics guidelines. Volunteers were imaged with both the prototype and the 
standard setup. From the clinical protocol of the EMINENCE study a 3D T2-SPACE (TR, 
1300 ms; TE, 90 ms; slice thickness, 1 mm; number of averages, 1; flip angle, 110 deg; pixel 
spacing, 0.5\0.5 mm; FOV, 320x320x176 mm3) and a T1-VIBE Dixon sequence for synthetic 
CT (TR, 4.05 ms; TE, 2.57 ms; slice thickness, 2 mm; number of averages, 2; flip angle, 9 
deg; pixel spacing, 1.18\1.18 mm; FOV, 490x490x288 mm3) were tested. SNR was compared 
between imaging setups for an ROI defined in normal muscle tissue in the anterior neck (6 cm 
distance from isocenter). SNR was calculated as the ratio of ROI mean signal over the ROI 
standard deviation.

3. Results 
ACR image quality tests 
ACR test results from the comparison of MR image quality with the prototype setup vs. 
standard setup are presented in Figure 2. The figure shows the results for each image quality 
test metric as a function of phantom position in SI direction. ACR acceptance criteria for 
spatial resolution AP (a), slice thickness accuracy (b), slice position accuracy (c, d), ghosting 
(g), and geometric accuracy AP (h) were met with both the prototype and standard setup at all 
scan positions. Criteria for spatial resolution and geometric accuracy in other directions were 
also met and are presented in Supplementary Figure 2. Criteria for PIU (e) and low-contrast 
object detectability scores (f) were met at all scan positions with the prototype setup, but not 
with the standard setup which failed at position 20 cm (thorax) for PIU and at all positions > 4 
cm SI (neck/thorax) for detectability. Compared to the standard setup, MR signal with the 
prototype setup was on average increased by a factor of 1.03 at head (-12 – 0 cm), and 2.0 at 
neck/thorax bed positions (0 – 20 cm; Figure 2i). Similarly, SNR was increased by a factor of 
1.03 at head, and 1.6 at neck/thorax positions (Figure 2k). The signal and SNR increase was 
statistically significant at neck/thorax (p=0.031 for both), but not at head positions. 
 
Repeatability and reproducibility 
Table 1 presents the monthly ACR test results of MR image quality with the prototype setup 
obtained in one center. Results for T1w and T2w MR image quality and geometric accuracy 
are listed per month. In addition, ACR acceptance criteria, monthly mean, standard deviation 
and the within-center coefficients of variation are shown. The prototype setup passed all ACR 
criteria for T1w MR, T2w MR and geometric accuracy in all tests, except for the PIU 
criterion of T1w and T2w MR which was not met in three of six tests. Thus, in total, 20 of 22 
ACR criteria were met in all tests. Repeatability standard deviations were ≤1 mm for all 
differences in reference to distance, ≤9 percentage points for percentage differences and 0 
spokes for low-contrast detectability scores. The monthly repeatability variation relative to the 
ACR criterion, wCV, was 4.9% on average.  
Table 2 lists the ACR test results from all centers. Per center, all ACR acceptance criteria 
were met for all criteria except for PIU of T1w MR in center 2, where a small difference to 
the acceptance limit of 1% was found. Across centers, the upper limits of reproducibility 
standard deviations were similar to the ones for repeatability, within . 01 mm, 1 percentage 
11 
 
point and 1 spoke, except for slice position and a horizontal measure of geometric accuracy. 
These were up to .7 and 1.0 mm larger, respectively. The intercenter reproducibility variation 
relative to the ACR criterion, iCV, was 7.8% on average.  
  
QIBA diffusion tests 
SNR results from DWI phantom measurements with the prototype vs. standard setup are 
presented in Supplementary Figure 3, both for the QIBA benchmark sequence and the clinical 
RESOLVE sequence. The prototype setup passed the QIBA SNR criterion (SNR > 50) for all 
DW images of the clinical sequence and the benchmark sequence, except for the b2000 
image. The standard setup passed the criterion for all DW images with the clinical sequence 
but failed the criterion for all images with the benchmark sequence. The SNR in the DW 
images was on average 1.7 (range: 1.66 – 1.87) times higher with the prototype setup 
compared to the standard setup. 
Analysis of the ADC maps measured with the prototype setup yielded the results listed in 
Table 3. Benchmark sequence ADC maps with the prototype setup passed all QIBA 
acceptance criteria for ADC bias, ADC repeatability, and ADC b-value dependencies, but not 
for ADC precision. Similar results were observed for the clinical sequence, with the setup 
complying with all criteria but precision. 
 
Volunteer test 
T2-SPACE and T1-VIBE Dixon in-phase images of one volunteer are presented in Figure 3. 
Images acquired with prototype and standard setup are shown side-by-side. For both 
volunteers, the SNR in neck was 1.5 (T2-SPACE) and 1.7 (T1-VIBE Dixon) times higher for 
the prototype setup than for the standard setup. 
 
4. Discussion 
In this study we presented a novel prototype setup for PET/MR imaging in patients with head 
and neck cancer scheduled for radiotherapy. From a systematic analysis using the ACR 
phantom, our main finding was that the prototype setup increased the SNR at neck/thorax 
positions significantly compared to the standard setup by a factor of 1.6 (Fig. 2k, T1w MR, 
p=0.031). Imaging of healthy volunteers with sequences from a clinical protocol showed a 
similar increase in SNR in the neck by a factor of 1.5 to 1.7. The setup repeatedly met all 
ACR acceptance criteria of MR image quality in phantoms except for the image uniformity 
12 
 
measure PIU. Interestingly, the setup complied with the criterion for low-contrast object 
detectability (≥ 37 visible spokes out of 40 total) at all tested neck and thorax positions, 
whereas the standard setup did not (Fig. 2f). This finding may be attributed to the increase in 
SNR. Low-contrast detectability has earlier been shown to be a critical criterion for a pelvic 
radiotherapy setup presented by Wyatt et al. for a 3T PET/MR system (Signa PET/MR, GE 
Healthcare, Milwaukee, USA). Their study found scores of 22 ± 2 (T1w, values read from fig. 
3 in (30)) or 15 ± 1 spokes (T2w) and suggested to increase number of signal averages during 
acquisition or to use noise reduction reconstruction techniques to improve SNR and thereby, 
detectability (30). The ACR compliant detectability scores with our prototype setup indicate 
higher image quality, superior compared to a standard setup in lower neck and upper thorax. 
This may benefit contouring accuracy of radiotherapy target and risk volumes or quantitative 
image feature calculations in such regions. Additional actions to increase SNR in clinical 
protocols as mentioned in (30) may still be considered an option, but not a necessity. 
 
Repeatability and reproducibility 
Another main finding was that MR image quality with the prototype setup was stable over 
three months and complied with ACR criteria in three different centers. For the ACR test 
metrics, the average reproducibility variation (7.8%) across centers was slightly larger than 
the average repeatability variation (4.9%) within a single center. This seems plausible as 
different imaging systems may add variation (33). Notably, geometric accuracy findings 
complied with the 2 mm acceptable distortion limit for MR-based radiotherapy (34). This 
points towards a robust performance of the proposed setup for multicenter imaging-based 
radiotherapy trials. 
We could not find any literature where MR image quality with a radiotherapy setup for hybrid 
PET/MR has been investigated in monthly repeat scans or in a multicenter study before. 
However, Wyatt et al. studied monthly repeatability of MR image quality in a single center 
study for an anterior array coil and spine coil like in a pelvic setup but without using a flat 
tabletop or coil bridge. The authors documented monthly standard variations of up to 1.1 mm, 
.8 percentage points and 2 spokes maximum for distance, percentage and detectability scores 
(35). Our estimates of maximum variation seem in good agreement with (35) for distance and 
detectability measures, within .1 mm and 2 spokes, but less for image uniformity measure 
PIU. The higher PIU variation with our setup may be explained by the more complex coil 
configuration of three flexible coils and spine coil with varying distances to the phantom. 
Notably, at the head/neck position the spine coil covers only part of the posterior phantom 
13 
 
side. In a pelvic setup the coil-phantom coverage and distance are more uniform. Also, in 
contrast to our study, flat tabletop and coil bridges were not present in the tests by Wyatt and 
colleagues resulting in a closer distance between phantom and coils, a higher coil fill factor, 
and likely, improved but optimistic estimates of SNR and image quality. We would 
recommend performing the tests with fully mounted radiotherapy setup including tabletop and 
coil holders or coil bridges for more realistic estimates of image quality. 
 
Selection of image quality metrics 
Some ACR metrics depend on the system rather than the coil setup, such as geometric 
accuracy and slice position, which are influenced by the system’s B0 field inhomogeneity 
and/or gradient nonlinearity (36). Coil setup related image quality metrics include image 
uniformity, SNR and low-contrast object detectability. However, system related metrics were 
included in the analysis as these remain relevant for overall image quality performance as 
well as for radiotherapy planning purposes such as target and organ contouring or dose 
planning, which requires high spatial integrity of images. 
 
Different radiotherapy setups on the market 
Besides the pelvic setup by Wyatt et al., several setup designs with coil holders and body 
matrix coils have been proposed for PET/MR in radiotherapy patients (21,27–29,31). Besides 
reduced low-contrast object detectability, SNR in MR images has proven to be a major 
critical factor. Compared to diagnostic imaging, reductions in SNR of 25% up to 46% have 
been reported (27–30). These findings motivate improvements in setup design for better SNR 
and detectability, especially in neck and upper thorax. Two previous imaging setups have 
been proposed for patients with head and neck cancer (21,27,28,31), but neither setup has 
been optimized for neck or thorax imaging. In the studies conducted by Olin et al., Paulus et 
al., and Winter et al. the head and neck setup (Qfix, Avondale, PA, USA) consisted of a pair 
of head coil holders covering brain, head and chin but not the anterior neck/thorax (21,27,28), 
which is suboptimal for SNR and image quality in this region. An additional flex coil can be 
placed on neck and thorax to compensate for a lower SNR and image quality, but without a 
dedicated coil holder solution for a reproducible position it is not possible to correct for PET 
signal attenuation (21). Another head setup (Medibord) presented by Taeubert et al. did not 
include a neck/thorax coil setup or mask fixation devices (31). Paulus et al. proposed a whole-
body setup, but it was not shown whether it would be compatible with neck and shoulder 
mask fixation (32). Brynolfsen et al. presented a radiotherapy coil setup for a GE PET/MR 
14 
 
scanner, but imaging in head/neck/thorax as well as compatibility with head, neck and 
shoulder mask fixation was not investigated (29). A dedicated neck/thorax coil component as 
proposed with our study showed to improve MR signal, SNR and image quality in the 
neck/thorax region. This could benefit target contouring on anatomical MR images, the 
integration of functional MR techniques into radiotherapy, as well as developments in 
quantitative imaging biomarkers such as diffusion information derived from DWI, where 
signal and SNR are known to become critically low in images with high diffusion-weightings 
(37). 
 
Diffusion-weighted imaging 
With the diffusion phantom experiments in the neck bed position, we found that the prototype 
setup complied with the QIBA acceptance criterion for SNR in the DWI benchmark sequence 
for all b-values ≤ 900 s/mm2. These results stand in contrast to the standard setup which did 
not fulfill the QIBA SNR criterion in any of the EPI b-value images. SNR was higher and 
complied with the QIBA criterion for both setups when using the RESOLVE sequence from 
the clinical protocol of the EMINENCE trial. Analysis of the ADC maps revealed that the 
prototype setup passed all ADC QIBA criteria except precision. Increasing the number of 
signal averages in the acquisition may be a simple method to further improve SNR and thus, 
ADC precision, but would come at the expense of longer scan time. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study with a radiotherapy setup for PET/MR which follows 
the QIBA guidelines and compares diffusion phantom measures to QIBA benchmark criteria. 
QIBA tests were chosen as benchmark tests in this study, as these are a well-established 
consensus standard used to benchmark DWI performance of other novel hybrid MR systems 
such as the MR-Linac (33,38,39). The positive QIBA findings for SNR and ADC quality with 
the proposed setup increase the confidence that DWI information can be clinically used for 
radiotherapy contouring, integrated into treatment planning and used for developments of 
quantitative DWI biomarkers (37). The SNR in the b2000 image was below the criterion. 
However, to date, such high b-values are usually not used in head/neck cancer, and may be 
seen as less of a limitation (37). 
 
Limitations   
A main limitation in our study was that monthly ACR repeat measurements were only 
performed in one center, whereas results obtained in the two other centers relied on one-time 
measurements. Longitudinal repeats in all centers would enhance accuracy and robustness of 
15 
 
the repeatability and reproducibility estimates. Moreover, longitudinal repeats were 
performed for three months only. Repeats over a 6- or 12-months period might give more 
insights into long term performance trends. However, in an ACR study with an experimental 
pelvic setup no monthly trends appeared over 12 months (35). Finally, QIBA experiments 
were only conducted in one center and repeatability was limited to short-time estimates. 
Monthly repeat and multicenter replicate tests of DWI would give more insights into long 
term repeatability and reproducibility. Performance assessment of PET was beyond the scope 
of this work. Feasibility of PET attenuation correction has been demonstrated for radiotherapy 
setups elsewhere (27,31), and will be evaluated for our setup in future work. 
 
Conclusions 
A novel prototype radiotherapy setup for hybrid PET/MR imaging in patients with head and 
neck cancer was implemented in three centers. Phantom experiments suggest higher SNR and 
better detectability in neck and upper thorax compared to a standard radiotherapy setup. 
Proof-of-principle was demonstrated in healthy volunteers. Compliance with nearly all ACR 
and QIBA acceptance criteria as well as good repeatability and reproducibility indicate robust 
usability of the setup for multicenter trials. The proposed setup may thus advance the usage of 
PET/MR in radiotherapy and benefit developments of quantitative imaging biomarkers for 
personalized treatment of head and neck cancer.

MR image in (d) was taken in a volunteer. Images are true to scale. Analysis was focused on 
phantom positions from -12 to 0, 0 to 12 and 12 to 20 cm SI which were considered as head, 
neck and upper thorax positions, respectively. This range is most relevant for head/neck 
cancer patients, while the prototype setup can in principle be used for imaging from brain to 
lower thorax.

Supplementary Figure 2: Spatial resolution (a) and geometric accuracy in different 
directions (b-g) with head/neck/thorax prototype setup (blue) as compared to the standard 
head-only setup (orange) evaluated with the ACR phantom. ACR criteria are indicated by 
dotted black lines. Abbrev.: LR, left-right; SI, superior-inferior; AP, anteroposterior; sl., 
image slice; LLUR, lower left to upper right; ULLR, upper left to lower right.

Supplementary Figure 3: Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in diffusion-weighted images with 
head/neck/thorax prototype (blue) and standard head-only setup (orange), plotted as function 
of b-value. a: SNR with the benchmark EPI sequence, b: with the clinical RESOLVE 
sequence. Data was measured with the QIBA diffusion phantom at a neck position. QIBA 
acceptance criterion for minimum SNR is indicated as dotted line. SNR of b0 appears reduced 
compared to b-values > 0, as the 3-scan/4-scan trace method enhances the SNR for b > 0.
