Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in encoding clinical knowledge and
responding to complex medical queries with appropriate clinical reasoning. However, their applicability in
subspecialist or complex medical settings remains underexplored. In this work, we probe the performance
of AMIE, a research conversational diagnostic AI system, in the subspecialist domain of breast oncology
care without specific fine-tuning to this challenging domain. To perform this evaluation, we curated a set of
50 synthetic breast cancer vignettes representing a range of treatment-naive and treatment-refractory cases
and mirroring the key information available to a multidisciplinary tumor board for decision-making (openly
released with this work). We developed a detailed clinical rubric for evaluating management plans, including
axes such as the quality of case summarization, safety of the proposed care plan, and recommendations
for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and hormonal therapy. To improve performance, we enhanced
AMIE with the inference-time ability to perform web search retrieval to gather relevant and up-to-date
clinical knowledge and refine its responses with a multi-stage self-critique pipeline. We compare response
quality of AMIE with internal medicine trainees, oncology fellows, and general oncology attendings under
both automated and specialist clinician evaluations. In our evaluations, AMIE outperformed trainees and
fellows demonstrating the potential of the system in this challenging and important domain. We further
demonstrate through qualitative examples, how systems such as AMIE might facilitate conversational
interactions to assist clinicians in their decision making. However, AMIE’s performance was overall inferior
to attending oncologists suggesting that further research is needed prior to consideration of prospective
uses.
1 Introduction
A significant and growing challenge facing healthcare systems globally is the shortage of specialty medical
expertise [1–3]. This challenge is particularly acute in subspecialist fields like breast oncology, where projected
staffing shortages are compounded by the need for patients to navigate time-consuming sequences of referrals
and investigations [4]. This process exacerbates the already limited availability and accessibility of medical
expertise, leading to delays in timely and effective care and ultimately increasing the risk of morbidity and
mortality due to disease progression [5].
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Google’s Gemini [6] and OpenAI’s GPT4 [7] are notable for their
ability to understand, generate, and interact with human language. These foundational models serve as
versatile building blocks that can be fine-tuned for specialized domains and applied to previously unseen
downstream tasks. LLMs display great potential in encoding general medical knowledge [8, 9], and have
demonstrated expert-level performance in a wide variety of tasks including question-answering for medical
licensing-style examinations, open-ended consumer question-answering, visual question-answering, medical
text summarization [10, 11], differential diagnosis in complex cases [12], and more. This, in turn, has meant
LLMs finding applications in non-specialized healthcare tasks such as knowledge retrieval, summarization
and administrative assistance [13–15]; however, their performance in complex subspecialty settings such as
oncology care remains poorly examined [16].
This study probes the potential of specialized medical LLMs to capture the diagnostic and therapeutic nuances

of decision-making for breast oncology care. Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women,
and artificial intelligence (AI) tools have already demonstrated great promise at earlier stages of healthcare
delivery for this disease, most notably in imaging for disease screening [17, 18]. Beyond initial diagnostics,
breast cancer has well-studied management pathways, representing a promising domain for LLMs to serve as
clinical decision support tools, and providing a well-structured but challenging setting in which to test the
subspecialist medical knowledge of LLMs [19]. Oncology cases present significant complexity due to variations
in disease presentation, the reliance on multiple radiology imaging modalities, intricate family histories, and
the incorporation of molecular and genetic studies. Moreover, treatment strategies, including neoadjuvant and
adjuvant therapies [20], introduce further complexity [21]. We define neoadjuvant therapy as a pre-surgical
treatment to downstage tumors, while adjuvant therapy is used in the post-surgical setting to eliminate residual
disease, tailored according to molecular and histopathological features [22]. Available adjuvant therapies
include broad chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted molecular therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and
endocrine therapies [23].
While well-resourced cancer centers have access to a range of experienced breast oncologists with whom a case
can be referred or discussed, smaller regional providers can face resource constraints or lack access to the
same breadth of expertise [24–27]. An AI system capable of bridging this gap by democratizing access to
niche specialty expertise could be an aid for local providers and aid the quality of initial triage. Such a system
might, for example, empower oncologists in under-resourced regional or rural settings to make more informed
treatment decisions and confident referrals, ultimately contributing to more equitable cancer care [28].
In this study, we investigate the performance of Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) [10], a recent
research, conversational diagnostic medical AI system, in this subspecialist domain of breast oncology. Our
objective is to understand the performance and limitations of LLMs in the type of reasoning and decision-
making undertaken by a breast oncology care team when presented with the same results of investigations
and plausible case vignettes. This builds on recent work exploring the potential of AMIE in subspecialty
cardiology settings [29].
Our key contributions are as follows:
• Open-source dataset of representative breast cancer scenarios: Collaborating with three
breast cancer specialists, we develop and open-source a set of 50 synthetic breast cancer scenarios.
These scenarios reflect a realistic array of clinical presentations in our collaborating real-world center,
ranging from common phenotypes in treatment-naive patients to metastatic and end-stage disease in
treatment-refractory individuals.
• Comprehensive evaluation rubric for breast oncology assessments: We design a detailed
19-question rubric to rigorously evaluate the quality of breast oncology assessments, focusing on aspects
like management reasoning, safety considerations, and summarization.
• Novel inference strategy for enhanced LLM performance in breast oncology: We employ a
lightweight inference strategy that combines web search and self-critique to enhance the performance of
AMIE, a research conversational diagnostic medical AI system, in the subspecialty of breast oncology.
This approach leverages external knowledge and a sequential chain of reasoning to improve AMIE’s
assessments on the 50 synthetic cases without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.
• Benchmarking LLM performance against human clinicians: Our evaluation reveals that AMIE’s
performance surpasses that of internal medicine trainees and early oncology fellows along majority
of criteria considered. While AMIE demonstrates promising capabilities, it does not yet achieve the
consistent performance level of experienced oncology attending specialists.
• Illustrating clinical applications: We present qualitative examples of beneficial revisions to clinician
assessments and realistic hypothetical dialogue scenarios to illustrate the potential clinical utility of
systems like AMIE in democratizing breast oncology expertise.

2 Methods
2.1 Synthetic breast cancer case generation
A panel of three breast oncologists from Houston Methodist Hospital, Texas, United States, gathered to
discuss the range of breast cancer cases commonly encountered at the Breast Center and the community
satellite clinics. The panel categorized cases into two broad groups: treatment-naive cases, which are typically
new referrals to the clinic, and treatment-refractory cases, characterized by disease progression. Based on this
categorization, the panel generated 50 synthetic cases, reflecting common etiologies in the treatment-naive
group and more advanced cases with less clear treatment guidance in the treatment-refractory group. This
approach aimed to capture a representative range of scenarios that were typically encountered in the center’s
practice, ensuring representation of real-world challenges in breast cancer management.
By including both treatment-naive and treatment-refractory cases, the panel captured a spectrum of breast
cancer presentations, from common etiologies seen in the community to more advanced and challenging
situations seen at tertiary care centers. The breadth of breast oncology represented in the synthetic cases
is illustrated in Tables A.1 and A.2. Following the construction of the synthetic cases, another experienced
breast oncologist, who had not been involved in the initial case creation, reviewed the synthetic cases to verify
the accuracy and realism of the scenarios. This process also involved refinement of the cases to enhance their
clarity and ensure consistency in the level of detail provided. Oncologists involved in case curation were not
subsequently involved in the generation of care management plans for evaluation.
The resulting synthetic cases are a useful dataset for exploring and assessing the capabilities of LLMs for
breast cancer management decisions (see Tables A.1 and A.2 for summaries, and Table A.3 for the full case
description and ground-truth assessments). The synthetic cases reflect the expertise and consensus of a
panel of expert breast oncologists, providing a robust foundation for assessing the LLM performance against
established clinical knowledge and experience. The inclusion of rarer and boundary cases allows for evaluation
of the LLM capabilities across a spectrum of scenarios, encompassing both common and rare presentations,
alongside those which may pose treatment challenges.
2.2 Study design
The goal of our study was to examine the potential of AMIE [10] in breast oncology care and compare with
different levels of clinician expertise.
The study design (see Figure 1a) comprised of 50 scenarios being presented to AMIE as well as a diverse
group of clinicians including two internal medicine trainees, two early oncology trainees, and two experienced
general oncology attendings. In generating treatment plans for these cases, respondents were asked to answer
the following set of questions:
• Case summary: Summarize the clinically relevant features of the case.
• Neoadjuvant therapy: Is neoadjuvant therapy indicated here?
• Surgery: Is surgery indicated here?
• Adjuvant therapy: After surgery, which adjuvant therapy should be initiated (for instance, radiation
therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or targeted therapy)?
• Genetic counseling: Is genetic testing indicated here?
• Psychosocial support: What sort of psychosocial support do you expect the patient will need here?
AMIE and the clinicians’ responses were rigorously evaluated by a pool of five experienced breast cancer
specialists (with an average of 10 years of work experience). The oncology treatment plans were evaluated
based on oncologists’ knowledge of established management guidelines for breast cancer by the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [30].
Responses were evaluated using a rubric that comprised nineteen questions, chosen to reflect clinically relevant
axes including the quality of case summarization, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, safety and
personalization. These axes function as short-hand for a clinician to evaluate model responses, especially from
the perspective of utility in daily clinical practice. To ensure comprehensive and standardized assessment,
|4
oncologists at the participating center collaborated to create a rubric. This rubric identifies the essential
factors that clinicians must consider when making treatment decisions for breast cancer patients.
For each axis, a set of questions was developed to scrutinize the content and structure of the responses against
established clinical guidelines and current best practices in breast oncology. Specialist oncologists involved
in case curation iterated upon the phrasing of each item to ensure reproducibility of the response. Each
clinician response was evaluated once, while three evaluations were collected for AMIE in order to assess
inter-rater reliability. Of note, throughout the study, we make a distinction between traditional chemotherapy
that eliminates rapidly dividing cells, targeted therapy that focuses only on specific mutations or cell-surface
markers, and endocrine therapy that inhibits the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors.
2.3 Model inference
AMIE, a conversational diagnostic LLM based on PaLM 2 [31], was used to generate responses for the 50 cases.
We refer to [31] for details on the base LLM and [10] for details on model development and specialization.
We did not perform any additional fine-tuning for this task and instead iterated on the inference strategy to
optimize AMIE for this setting.
During inference, we leveraged a multi-step process in which AMIE drafted an initial response to the case
questions, used web search to retrieve relevant context, critiqued its initial response using this context, and
then revised its response based on this critique (see Figure 2). This process is described in more detail in
Figure A.8, with specific prompts listed in Section A.5. We used LLM-based auto-evaluation to compare our
method to zero-shot, few-shot, and search-only inference strategies (see Section A.4 for more details).

3 Results
3.1 AMIE generation of oncology management plans
We presented 30 treatment-naive and 20 treatment-refractory cases to AMIE. Model responses (see Figure 5
for an example) were recorded and evaluated by a panel of breast oncologists based on our pilot rubric for
clinical evaluation (see Figures 3 and 4). Over 95% of cases were deemed eligible for management reasoning
using a standard of care or clinical guidelines, while a deviation from standard of care was warranted in under
10% of cases.
Our evaluations indicate that treatment plans generated by AMIE for both treatment-naive and treatment-
refractory cases were generally plausible. In the majority of cases, the plans could be safely leveraged without

3.2 AMIE’s approach to survivorship, hospice care and residual disease
Survivorship care is an essential aspect of oncology, focusing on two key objectives: monitoring patients for
potential disease recurrence and managing the long-term side effects that may arise following completion
of active treatment. A subset of cases (n=6) presented to AMIE focused on high-risk surveillance and
survivorship scenarios. In each instance, AMIE accurately determined that no further treatment was necessary
or recommended appropriate chemoprevention strategy based on the patient’s presentation. In the majority
of cases where genetic testing was clinically indicated, AMIE successfully recognized patients (>85%) who
could benefit from genetic testing and subsequent counseling [32].
Among the oncology cases where surgery was indicated (n=35), we instructed AMIE to focus on the surgical
pathology report. AMIE effectively explained the key aspects of a pathology report in a patient-accessible
manner. Additionally, in every case, AMIE successfully identified the relevant sections that would indicate
residual disease or high-risk pathological features including positive surgical margins, high proliferative
index and lymphovascular invasion. Subsequently, AMIE linked the presence of residual disease to adjuvant
treatment implications in the majority of these cases (28 out of 35).
We presented AMIE with three cases of synthetic patients that were refractory to multiple lines of therapy and
experienced disease progression coupled with worsening performance status. This scenario is not uncommon
when oncology patients are admitted to the hospital with symptoms resulting from disease progression.
AMIE methodically identified the prior lines of treatment and the decline in performance status, ultimately
recommending compassionate care for these patients.
|8
3.3 AMIE surpasses trainees in most assessment domains, but did not reach the perfor-
mance of oncology attendings.
Using the criteria described in Figures 3 and 4, we compared the responses from AMIE, 2 internal medicine
residents, 2 first-year oncology fellows, and 2 experienced general oncology attendings. The responses from
general oncology attendings were considered the standard comparator arm, against the AMIE responses and
two trainee classes. The trainees excelled at synthesizing complex cases in a bias-free manner, recommending
supportive care services as well as understanding the role of performance status. However, due to gaps in
their knowledge, trainees were unable to consistently create safe and comprehensive cancer care plans.
For AMIE, neodjuvant therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy planning were the hardest management reasoning
tasks, while it performed well at surgical and adjuvant radiation planning. Notably, AMIE had higher quality
hormonal therapy recommendations for the treatment-naive patients, aligned with the expected greater benefit
of hormonal therapy to this subset of patients.
Figure 1 and Table 1 consolidate these results, demonstrating that while AMIE surpassed the performance of
trainees and fellows for most criteria, the system failed to match the consistent performance of the oncology
attendings. In Figures A.1 to A.4, we provide a more detailed breakdown of these results, including the
specific evaluation ratings chosen as well as separate analyses of the 30 treatment naive and 20 treatment
refractory cases.
To assess inter-rater reliability, we compared evaluations from the three raters for each of AMIE’s responses.
As seen in Table A.4, expert breast oncologists demonstrated substantial to nearly perfect agreement on
AMIE’s response quality regarding neoadjuvant therapy, surgical planning, and adjuvant radiation. They
also concurred on the absence of bias and hallucinations, and the need for supportive services. However, the
experts reached limited consensus on the appropriateness of proposed adjuvant treatments and the overall
harm posed by a model response.
3.4 Qualitative illustrations of potentially assistive utility
To explore the potential assistive effect of AMIE, we generated qualitative examples of AMIE revising
responses from the three clinician groups (see Figure 6) to the case presented in Figure 5. Across these
examples, AMIE adds relevant details to strengthen the completeness of the management plan without adding
incorrect, biased, or harmful content, improving the overall quality of the assessments in all three cases.
Additionally, in Section A.8, we present three scenarios which illustrate clinical applications of a conversational
system such as AMIE in assisting oncologists or conveying information to patients. Specifically, we simulated
conversations between AMIE and 1. An oncology attending inquiring about the Gail Model for Breast Cancer
Risk (Figure A.14), 2. An oncology fellow asking for assistance with next steps for investigation and referrals
for their patient (Figure A.15), and 3. A breast cancer patient wishing to understand the hormonal therapy
they will be receiving (Figure A.16).

AMIE Response
Case summary: A 41-year-old premenopausal woman presents with a small (8mm), 
Grade 1, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The tumor demonstrates strong estrogen 
receptor (ER 8/8) and progesterone receptor (PR 8/8) positivity, while being HER2 
negative (IHC 0). No lymph node involvement is clinically evident. The patient maintains 
an ECOG performance status of 0 and has a Ki-67 of 25%. Her Oncotype DX score is 12.
Neoadjuvant therapy: Neoadjuvant therapy is typically not indicated in this scenario 
due to the tumor's small size, favorable hormone receptor status, HER2 negativity, and 
low Oncotype DX score. 
Surgery: Surgery remains the primary treatment modality. Considering the small tumor 
size and negative lymph node status, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended to 
assess nodal involvement.  Lumpectomy with clear margins is the preferred surgical 
option to preserve breast tissue. However, mastectomy should also be discussed with 
the patient, factoring in her preferences and individual circumstances. 
The surgical pathology report should be scrutinized for:
●
Tumor size and grade confirmation: To ensure consistency with initial 
assessment.
●
Lymph node status:  Sentinel node pathology will guide further management.
●
Lymphovascular invasion: Presence may influence adjuvant therapy decisions.
●
Resection margins: Negative margins are crucial for successful local therapy.
Adjuvant therapy: 
●
Hormonal therapy: Given the strong ER/PR expression, adjuvant hormonal therapy 
is the cornerstone of treatment. For premenopausal patients like this one, 
tamoxifen for 5 years is the standard recommendation. 
●
Radiation therapy:  The decision to incorporate radiation therapy should be 
individualized through a multidisciplinary team discussion. Factors such as tumor 
size, margin status, and lymph node involvement will guide this decision.  
●
Chemotherapy: The tumor's hormone receptor positivity, HER2 negativity, and low 
Oncotype DX score suggest a low risk of recurrence. Therefore, chemotherapy is 
not indicated in this case.
●
Targeted therapy: As the tumor is HER2-negative, targeted therapy is not 
applicable.
Genetic testing: The patient's young age (41) warrants genetic testing as per NCCN 
guidelines to assess for hereditary cancer predisposition. Genetic counseling and testing 
should also be discussed with her family members. 
Psychosocial support:  Providing culturally sensitive counseling and psychosocial 
support is crucial throughout the patient's treatment journey and beyond.

Expert Feedback:
Internal Medicine Trainee:  AMIE adds tremendous value by teaching the trainee about available neoadjuvant regimens, what classes of treatments to consider, 
where to focus on for the surgical report, and similarly for adjuvant regimens. The response enhances the trainee's perspective on why genetic testing is 
recommended as well. Overall, very constructive improvement. A notable downside in this response is that the trainee originally had a gap in knowledge about 
what chemotherapy regimen to use, and AMIE suggested an older regimen with anthracycline use. Per current NCCN guidelines, anthracyclines are not the 
standard of care.
Early Oncology Fellow: AMIE brings the neoadjuvant and adjuvant regimens in focus, the surgical approach, as well as the sequence of various adjuvant 
treatments that can be used. In addition, there is a reference to NCCN guidelines for why genetic testing is recommended. Overall, a very reasonable 
enhancement to help the trainee learn how to formulate management plans. Again, the fellow had a gap in knowledge about the specific regimen to use, and 
AMIE assisted with an anthracycline-based approach which is not the standard of care currently. 
Experienced Oncology Attending: AMIE's response summarizes the key facts, and mentions a novel agent (Neratinib) that may not have been considered 
otherwise. It also gives a frame of reference for incorporating new therapies into standard of care when appropriate. Otherwise, the response provides 
reinforcement to what the attending already planned - most breast oncologists would already be fairly comfortable managing this case. In contrast to the 
trainees, the attending provided a concise treatment regimen and AMIE acknowledged the updated TCHP regimen.

4 Discussion
This study explores the potential of AMIE, a research-only conversational diagnostic AI system, in the
challenging subspecialist medical domain of breast oncology; without any specialization for this subspecialty.
To facilitate this exploration, the study first introduces a newly curated, openly available dataset of 50 diverse,
expert-validated breast cancer scenarios (Section A.2), capturing a variety of clinical presentations seen in a
real-world tertiary care center. Second, it proposes a 19-question rubric to evaluate the clinical quality of
breast oncology assessments, considering aspects including management reasoning and safety. Third, the
research proposes a novel lightweight inference strategy for large language models (LLMs) that combines web
search with self-critique technique [33], enhancing the performance of AMIE in breast cancer management
without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Fourth, through comparison against multiple levels of clinicians
and subspecialist evaluation, this study highlights the promising capabilities of AI systems like AMIE in
this challenging domain while acknowledging the superiority of experienced oncologists. Finally, through
demonstrations of AI assistance in revising assessments and conversing with both patients and providers, it
illustrates the potential for systems like AMIE to interactively assist clinicians once further improvements are
reached in performance.
It was particularly noteworthy that AMIE was not fine-tuned on breast cancer data or exposed to task-specific
datasets for the purpose of this subspecialist evaluation. Therefore, the challenging setting represents an out-
of-distribution task for a system optimised for general diagnostic dialogue. Despite this, overall performance
approximated or exceeded specialist trainees along many axes; even without access to relevant datasets such
as specialized guidelines or dosing information. This suggests that with further customization to the domain
(for example, access to such datasets for inference-time reasoning, or pretraining and fine-tuning) it may be
possible to achieve improved performance, highlighting the potential for these models in specialist settings.
4.1 Treatment nuances and trainee perspectives on AMIE
Although most of AMIE’s responses were not influenced by LLM-induced hallucinations, we recognize that
this may be more relevant when evaluating increasingly complex or a larger volume of cases. Determining
the optimal sequencing of adjuvant treatments and selecting the best therapy was a challenge for AMIE,
reflecting a common challenge in clinical practice when patients present after surgery or at disease progression.
One of the key challenges is that real-life sequencing of adjuvant treatments is driven by patient-specific
factors such as treatment tolerance, comorbidities, and varying response to therapy [34]. This approach can
occasionally diverge from established guidelines [35], and in some situations, a defined standard may not
exist. There are instances when oncologists depart from standard care due to patterns they notice in their
own practice or because expert consensus suggests alternative approaches that have not been codified into
guidelines. When faced with several equally viable treatments, an oncologist may have an intuition drawn
from clinical observations and apply them to a patient. A trained model may lack the ability to adapt to
the nuanced nature of patient responses, making it challenging to provide tailored recommendations that
align with evidence-based guidelines and the unique needs of each patient. There is also a risk that a model
might draw upon outdated information without understanding the evolving clinical context. For instance,
anthracycline-based regimens were once the standard of care for HER2-positive breast cancer [19], however,
due to concerns about toxicities [36], these regimens have been replaced by equally effective, more tolerable
therapies. Bridging the gap between an ideal treatment plan and the variability seen in clinical practice often
takes a clinician years of experience and represents an important consideration for LLMs such as AMIE to
provide utility in oncology [37].
Internal medicine residents and early oncology fellows demonstrated performance inferior to that of the
model, which likely reflects their stage in training and relative inexperience with oncology cases. Oncology
fellows, however, improve in case competence over time as they gain exposure to practice and develop a
deeper understanding of the nuanced management needed in oncology. Long-term follow-up comparing trainee
responses at the start and end of their training against AMIE would provide valuable insights towards the
degree of clinical exposure at which performance levels were comparable to or surpassing that observed from
AMIE in this study.
|12
4.2 Supportive care with AMIE
Supportive care services for oncology patients encompass a range of interventions designed to address the
physical, emotional and psychological challenges associated with treatment [38], whether for curative or
palliative management. Those recommended include psychological counseling and mental health support,
such as referrals to oncology-specific therapists and virtual support groups, which can provide patients
with strategies to manage anxiety and depression commonly associated with cancer diagnoses [39]. AMIE’s
supportive care recommendations were focused heavily on counseling and connecting patients with the
appropriate support groups, resources that are typically available in most community oncology settings. It
should be noted that the model did not have access to information regarding local service provision, or specific
information about patients’ social circumstances and preferences. These are important and challenging aspects
to account for in real-world practice and represent a notable limitation of our work. The trainees had a unique
perspective on connecting patients to an oncology navigator, a resource available at academic centers where an
oncology nurse helps coordinate care, particularly in regards to supportive services [40]. Financial counseling
is a major aspect where oncology navigators provide assistance in managing the logistical and financial
burdens of cancer care. Areas for improvement in supportive care include providing nutrition guidance from
registered dietitians specialized in oncology to help manage treatment-related side effects such as weight loss
and gastrointestinal issues. Referrals to physical and occupational therapy can also aid patients in maintaining
function and managing treatment-induced fatigue. Additionally, future work would need to include a focus on
pain management, especially non-opioid strategies, pharmacologic interventions and integrative therapies such
as acupuncture for patients with metastatic bone disease to alleviate cancer-related pain and improve quality
of life [41]. Lastly, while referrals to palliative care were indirectly noted in AMIE’s responses, they should be
explicitly highlighted under the supportive care domain due to their crucial role in providing symptom relief
and enhancing overall quality of life, especially for patients with metastatic disease [42].
4.3 Systemic inequities and oncology care
While LLMs have the potential to broaden access to oncology care and reduce racial inequities, it is crucial
to consider whether they might inadvertently exacerbate existing inequities. AI systems in medicine may
propagate biases, reflecting the inequities and imbalances present in the real-world data sources in which
training or evaluation are grounded [43]. A lack of diversity in the information available during model training
could theoretically result in models that do not adequately capture the biological and clinical variability seen in
underrepresented groups, potentially leading to less effective or even harmful treatment recommendations for
such populations [44]. This could further widen the gap in cancer outcomes between groups. Potential sources
of bias in training data for oncology models could also stem from the over-representation of certain populations,
particularly those of European descent, in clinical trials and medical datasets, a problem that is particularly
prevalent in oncology [45, 46]. Although beyond the scope of this work, it highlights the need for increasing
diversity in oncology datasets, evidence generation and care guidelines; to ensure that emerging models and
therapies are more equitable and reflect the broader patient population [47]. While our case studies were
intentionally designed without a focus on primary ancestry to focus the evaluation process on specific domains
of therapeutic decision-making, focused study of the fairness and equity implications of such systems are
needed to ensure a safe approach with respect to both access to care and patient outcomes. Systems intended
for real-world utility should undergo additional studies, comprehensively investigating these factors to ensure
that LLMs do not inadvertently contribute to or amplify existing inequities [48]. Our team has previously
suggested one such set of approaches for further evaluation, in the setting of single-turn question-answering [48].
Investigating the bias or equity implications in the oncology setting might require the design of focused
adversarial datasets, and the use of specific participatory research techniques. Openly available training
datasets, such as the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset [49], contain breast mass tissue samples
predominantly from patients in Wisconsin, lacking adequate representation of diverse populations. A model
built on such data could skew treatment recommendations, particularly for underrepresented groups [50]. For
instance, Black patients with triple-negative breast cancer were observed to have lower rates of pathological
complete response (27%) compared to other groups (all >30%) or recommended for additional treatment [51].
A model excluding such patients may be less likely to recommend continued treatment when low pCR is
observed, leading to suboptimal care outcomes for these populations [52].
|13
In medical deserts, areas where healthcare services are wholly or partially absent, patients often find their
medical needs partially or completely unmet, especially due to limited access to specialized care [53]. LLMs
with specialist-level accuracy might significantly benefit remote or rural communities lacking timely access to
subspecialists by assisting local providers and patients with straightforward questions, or drafting responses for
subspecialised triage and review. However, the performance of AMIE in democratizing oncology information
to such doctors (or patients) remains untested, and the current performance suggests the system is not yet
suitable for delivering definitive responses at the level of a specialized oncology attending in this domain. The
sensitive nature of oncology necessitates comprehensive evaluation frameworks to mitigate potential harms.
This risk is heightened by the possibility that language models may produce plausible yet incorrect medical
information. Without proper guardrails, such misinformation could mislead clinicians or exacerbate existing
biases [54]. Establishing clinical performance benchmarks and standards is an important step for oncology
care; and ensuring that LLM performance is examined with contamination analyses that assure the test set
was not utilized in model training. We openly release a specialised evaluation set of synthetic cases here, but
many more such evaluation datasets are required in this and other domains [55].
4.4 Limitations and future directions
While our work suggests interesting findings for this domain, they should be contextualized with awareness
of important limitations. The treatment plans generated by the model were simplified, providing broad
recommendations on general types of chemotherapy, but omitting the specific dosing schedules that are
necessary for patient care [56]. This issue also affected radiation therapy, as the model did not account for
the total duration of radiation treatments [57]. A model intended for clinical use should ideally address
the detailed dosing needs that are included in a real-world individualized treatment plan, which represents
an important avenue for future work. Furthermore, there are frequently international, regional or even
center-specific variations in care pathways or preferred practices; and exploration of these issues was not
included in this study [58]. Exploration of how AI systems might conform to such specific instructions for
desired practices would be an important area of study for generalization of the potential impact shown here.
Our study utilized synthetic cases and did not include longitudinal follow-up for the same patient, where the
model would adapt to evolving clinical events from one visit to the next. There were many advantages to
this approach, not least including the protection of patient privacy and the avoidance of unnecessary use of
real-world clinical data where not strictly required. However, real-world clinical workflows are often very
unpredictable and require real-time adjustments based on a patient’s needs, disease progression and evolving
treatment tolerance [59]. Future study designs that test models’ outputs over time, or in scenarios that
follow specific individuals’ oncology care across time, or multiple clinic visits, would significantly enhance
understanding of how LLMs might perform in real-world longitudinal oncology care. Handling the transition
to survivorship is an important area for this disease domain and would merit dedicated research.
Although our study touched upon many elements of decision-making relevant to breast oncology, we only
used 50 cases for model evaluation. This limited number of cases was designed to present an array of
treatment-naive and treatment-refractory cases from a real-world center of care, but would not fully capture
the diversity and complexity of all possible clinical presentations. The selection of these cases was performed
via an iterative design by a center’s experts qualitatively seeking to represent the diversity of decision-making
challenges encountered in one center, and was limited by practical constraints including investigator time.
This method itself many not have captured the long-tail of unique challenges present in a referral center, and
would be unable to capture differences in presentations or practice in different centers, regions or countries [60].
Consequently, the evaluation might not accurately reflect the model’s true capabilities or limitations when
applied in prospective clinical settings in one center, or be used to infer generalization to a broader patient
population in any other center.
We evaluated the model responses across several axes, however, our study scope excluded some practical
concerns such as treatment interruptions due to non-cancer related hospitalizations, or treatment dose
reductions due to emergence of side-effects [61]. Although our cases were not focused on treatment side-effects,
a comprehensive model response would address the off-target toxicities of a treatment and provide alternatives
if such toxicities were affecting the patient’s quality of life.
Enhancing the model’s performance on treatment planning would require leveraging comprehensive datasets
|14
such as the complete NCCN guidelines; alongside up-to-date information regarding issues such as dosing
schedules, radiation therapy duration, and specific adjuvant treatment protocols to generate more precise and
clinically relevant recommendations. Similarly, further research is required to expand the study evaluation
axes to highlight the potential for treatment interruptions, dose modifications, and management of off-target
toxicities.
Further research might also investigate the potential benefits of LLM-based clinical trial recommendations as
an endpoint for the generated treatment plans, especially in the treatment-refractory setting. Given a detailed
case vignette, if a patient has progressed on currently approved therapies, supportive care trials or phase I
clinical trials with novel agents may be appropriate recommendations. The use of a LLM to bridge cultural
and language barriers is also a promising area for research in oncology [62].
5 Conclusion
Our study addressed an unmet need to evaluate LLMs designed for medicine in the challenging subspecialized
setting of breast oncology care. In a simulated set of 50 cases designed to reflect a range of treatment-refractory
and treatment-naive presentations; AMIE (a research LLM for diagnostic dialogue) outperformed trainees
and fellows but was inferior to attending oncologists. Our work demonstrates the potential of AMIE in this
challenging and important domain, while highlighting important areas for further research, that would be
required to bridge towards prospective clinical utility.

A.4 AMIE auto-evaluation performance
We employed several inference strategies for generating responses to these cases with AMIE. See Figure A.10
for prompting details. To decide on which method to move forward with, we leveraged an auto-evaluation
procedure in which we had the model self-grade its responses on the evaluation rubric (Figures 3 and 4)
without having access to the ground truth answers for the cases.
Given a case response, the auto-rater generates evaluation ratings for each of the criteria in our evaluation
rubric. We leveraged a separate, generic Gemini 1.5 Pro model as the auto-rater (instead of using AMIE)
to mitigate preference towards AMIE’s responses. The auto-rater utilizes a chain-of-thought prompt (see
Figure A.5) to produce ratings. To encourage alignment with subspecialists, we used few-shot prompting,
providing an example response per possible evaluation score. After the study, we validated the auto-evaluator
by comparing auto-evaluation ratings to the final evaluation ratings provided by the subspecialist evaluators
(see Section A.7 and Table A.5).
Ultimately, the auto-evaluation suggested that allowing the model to use web search and self-critique would
yield relatively higher scores on most aspects of the rubric, and thus this was the method we chose to move
forward with. The other methods we considered included:
• Zero-shot. Simply asking the model to answer the case questions given the case information.
• Few-shot. Providing 4 few-shot examples of cases and “gold-standard” answers provided by an attending
oncologist and then asking the model to answer the case questions.
• Search Asking the model to answer the case questions given the case information + search results.
With this method, the model did not draft, critique, and revise its response; instead it had to generate
the response directly.
• Self-critique (chosen method). Asking the model to answer the case questions, critique its response
based on search results, and then revise its response.

A.5 Prompting details for search augmented self-critique inference
Figure A.8 | AMIE web search and self-critique inference strategy. AMIE used a multi-step procedure in order to craft
responses to each of the 50 cases. After drafting an initial response, AMIE used search to retrieve relevant information about
each of the case questions and then critiqued and revised this initial response.
Inference Strategy for AMIE responses
AMIE leveraged a multi-step process involving search-retrieval and self-critique in order to produce
grounded, high quality responses to the case questions. The process was as follows:
1. Draft response. First, AMIE generated a zero-shot response to the case questions described in
Section 2.2 (see Figure A.9).
2. Search Retrieval. AMIE leveraged Google search to retrieve relevant information about the
neoadjuvant therapy, surgery, adjuvant therapy, genetic testing, and psychosocial support (see
Figure A.10).
3. Self-Critique. Using these search results, AMIE generated critique of its drafted response,
listing the good and bad aspects of this initial response (see Figure A.12).
4. Revision. Using this critique, AMIE revised its responses to the case questions (see Figure A.13).
The revised output was used as the final model response and sent for expert evaluation.

A.6 Inter-rater reliability of human evaluators
To assess inter-rater reliability, we compared the three evaluations that were performed for each of AMIE’s
responses. To quantify inter-rater reliability, we used Randolph’s Kappa [1], which ranges from -1 to 1, as a
metric of agreement for each criteria. While no interpretation of this metric is universally accepted, Landis
& Koch [2] suggested the following heuristic for interpreting kappa values: [−1, 0]: poor agreement, (0, 0.2]:
slight agreement, (0.2, 0.4]: fair agreement, (0.4, 0.6]: moderate agreement, (0.6, 0.8]: substantial agreement,
and (0.8, 1.0]: almost perfect agreement.
We first computed this metric for the original, granular categorical evaluations (with multiple possible
options per criteria). Then, we bucketed the results as described in Figure 3 and Figure 4 into “favorable”
and “unfavorable” ratings and computed Randolph’s Kappa on these binary evaluation outcomes. A high
discrepancy between the randolph’s kappa for the binary and categorical outcomes, as is seen in the “Supportive
Services” or “Demographic Bias” criteria, may indicate that raters heavily disagreed on their exact evaluation
ratings despite agreeing on the valence of those ratings.
Table A.4 | Inter-rater reliability for model evaluation. Each model response was evaluated by 3 breast cancer specialists.
To assess inter-rater reliability, Randolph’s kappa was computed for each criteria. We computed Randolph’s kappa both on the
original categorical ratings, as well as the binary “favorable” or “unfavorable” rating for each criteria (see Figures 3 and 4). The
proportion of cases which the 3 specialist rated AMIE’s response as favorable is listed in the column “AMIE Favorable”. For Q1
and Q11 from the management reasoning axis, the answer choices are not inherently favorable or unfavorable and we instead use
the proportion of "Yes" responses.

A.7 Reliability of auto-evaluation
We assessed the quality of our auto-evaluation method by computing the agreement of auto-ratings to human
ratings with Randolph’s Kappa. We computed Randolph’s Kappa between the auto-evaluation and the
specialist raters, both with the granular categorical labels as well as the binary “favorable” or “unfavorable”
rating for each criteria (see Figures 3 and 4).
For several criteria, we observed that inter-rater reliability (see Section A.6) was often higher than the
auto-evaluation agreement with these specialists, suggesting our method failed to fully capture the expertise
of the specialist evaluators. Nevertheless, for many criteria, auto-evaluation agreed moderately or strongly
with the specialist ratings. For a few criteria, such as “adjuvant radiation” and “adjuvant chemo”, we observed
poor agreement, while for “No Demographic Bias”, auto-evaluation heavily disagreed with the specialists.
Furthermore, some items had a large discrepancy when using the categorical vs. the binary versions of the
rubric items. When the categorical kappa score is much lower, such as with “Supportive Services”, we infer
that raters largely agree on the valence of a rating but not the exact option choice (i.e., “Yes, all appropriate”
vs. “Yes, some appropriate”).
Table A.5 | Agreement between specialists and auto-evaluation. Here, we present agreement between the auto-evaluation
ratings and the 3 specialist ratings for the final AMIE model responses. We note the proportion of AMIE’s responses that were
marked favorably by a majority of the evaluators for each criteria. We then use Randolph’s Kappa to quantify their agreement,
testing both the categorical rubric options and binary favoribility outcomes for each criteria.

A.8 Simulated dialogue examples
Here, we provide examples of simulated conversations between AMIE and itself acting as 1. An oncology
attending, 2. an oncology fellow, and 3. A patient. These examples qualitatively illustrate how a conversational
system such as AMIE could aid in breast cancer management.
(a) Scenario
(b) Example Dialogue
Okay, AMIE, I have a 34-year-old female presenting with a strong 
family history of cancer. She's concerned about her breast cancer 
risk and wants to know what we can do to mitigate it.  
Understood.  I have access to her medical records and family 
history.  She has a maternal aunt with breast cancer, mother with 
ovarian cancer, two brothers with prostate cancer, and her father 
with thyroid cancer.  This is a significant family history.
AI
Exactly.  I want to discuss her risk assessment with her.  Can you help 
me explain the Gail  model parameters and share other models for 
risk assessment that compare an individual's risk with that of the 
general population?  I'm particularly interested in models that 
appropriately fractionate family history and personal risks.
Of course.  The Gail model is a widely used tool for estimating breast 
cancer risk.  It considers age, race/ethnicity, breast density, family 
history of breast cancer, age at menarche, age at first live birth, and 
number of breast biopsies.  However, it doesn't fully account for the 
complex interplay of different cancer types within a family.
AI
There are several other models, including the Tyrer-Cuzick 
model, the Claus model, and the IBIS model.  These models 
incorporate more detailed family history information, including 
the specific types of cancer and the age at diagnosis of 
relatives.  They also consider personal risk factors like BRCA1/2 
mutations and other genetic predispositions.
AI
AI
Right, that's what I was thinking.  It's a good starting 
point, but we need something more nuanced.  What 
other models do you have in mind?
That's helpful.  Can you tell me more about the 
Tyrer-Cuzick model?  How does it handle family history?
 Interesting.  So, it's more sensitive to the specific details 
of the family history.  What other parameters do we 
need from the patient to use this model?
Besides the family history, we need her age, age at 
menarche, age at first live birth, number of breast 
biopsies, and any history of atypical hyperplasia.  We also 
need to know if she has any known genetic mutations.
Okay, I'll gather that information from her.  Do you have any 
recommendations for genetic testing based on her family history?
Given her family history, particularly the ovarian cancer 
in her mother and prostate cancer in her brothers, I 
recommend testing for BRCA1/2 mutations.  We should 
also consider testing for other genes associated with 
breast and ovarian cancer, such as TP53, PTEN, and ATM.
AI
Good point.  I'll discuss these options with her.  Do you 
have any resources or materials that I can share with her to 
explain these models and genetic testing in more detail?
Yes, I can provide you with links to patient-friendly resources 
from the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer 
Society.  I can also generate a personalized risk assessment 
report based on the information we gather.
AI
Excellent.  This is very helpful.  I appreciate your insights, AMIE.  Let's get 
started with gathering the necessary information from the patient.
Strengths:  AMIE correctly understands how the family history 
may be over-estimated by the Gail model and suggests the 
Tyrer-Cuzick model as an appropriate alternative. AMIE describes 
the components of the Tyrer-Cuzick model, provides genetic 
testing recommendations for BRCA1 and 2 and mentions that 
testing for high penetrance breast cancer genes such as PTEN 
and TP53 should also be offered.
Weaknesses: All genetic testing must be accompanied by a 
consultation with a genetic counselor who can provide patients with 
further insight and help determine appropriateness of testing other 
family members. The model did not make this suggestion.  
Additionally, when asked for necessary parameters for the 
Tyrer-Cuzick model, the model misses the age at diagnosis of 
relatives, as well as height and weight of the patient.
(c) Feedback from breast oncologist
SCENARIO: A 34-year-old pre-menopausal female presents to the breast oncology clinic. She was referred here by her primary care 
physician. She has a significant family history of breast cancer in one maternal aunt, history of ovarian cancer in her mother, prostate 
cancer in two brothers and thyroid cancer in her father. Given the lineage of cancer history, she would like to know her risk for breast 
cancer and take steps to mitigate it.
ATTENDING QUESTIONS:  Can you help explain the Gail model parameters and share other models for risk assessment that compare an 
individual’s risk with that of general population. Preference here should be given to models that appropriately fraction the family history 
and personal risks. What other parameters do you need from the patient?
AI
The Tyrer-Cuzick model uses a "family history score" that considers 
the number of affected relatives, their relationship to the patient, and 
the age at diagnosis.  It also accounts for the specific type of cancer, 
giving more weight to breast cancer compared to other cancers.

(a) Scenario
(b) Example Dialogue
Hi AMIE, I have a 55-year-old post-menopausal female presenting for 
a routine follow-up. She was diagnosed with triple-negative breast 
cancer 3 years ago and treated with pembrolizumab, paclitaxel, and 
carboplatin per KEYNOTE 522, followed by surgery and adjuvant 
pembrolizumab. She had a complete pathological response. Now 
she's experiencing weight loss, difficulty breathing, chest discomfort, 
and blurry vision. Any thoughts?
Based on her history and current symptoms, it's important to rule out 
recurrence and consider potential complications from her previous treatment.  
I suggest we start with a thorough history and physical exam.  Would you like 
to ask her about the onset, duration, and severity of her symptoms?
AI
Yes, definitely. I'll ask her about the timing of these symptoms, if 
they're progressive, and if there's any associated pain.  Anything else 
I should ask her about?
It would be helpful to inquire about any other symptoms she 
may be experiencing, such as fatigue, night sweats, or bone 
pain.  These could be suggestive of metastatic disease.  Also, 
it's important to assess her social history, including smoking 
status and any family history of cancer.
AI
Given her symptoms, a chest X-ray and a CT scan of the 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis would be appropriate to assess 
for any signs of metastatic disease.  We should also consider 
a brain MRI to evaluate for potential brain metastases, 
especially with blurry vision.
AI
AI
Good point. I'll ask about those as well.  I'm 
thinking we should order some imaging studies.  
What would you recommend?
Okay, I agree.  Those imaging studies make sense.  
Should we also order any blood work?
Great, I'll order those tests.  Anything else we should consider?
It's important to review her previous pathology reports and 
consider a biopsy if any suspicious lesions are identified on 
imaging.  We should also discuss the possibility of a referral to a 
pulmonologist for further evaluation of her respiratory symptoms.
Okay, I'll review her pathology reports and schedule a 
pulmonology consult.  I'll also discuss the possibility of a biopsy 
with her if needed.  Anything else I should be aware of?
It's important to remember that triple-negative breast 
cancer can be aggressive, and early detection of 
recurrence is crucial.  We should also consider the 
possibility of immunotherapy-related pneumonitis, 
especially given her history of pembrolizumab treatment.
AI
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.  I'll discuss the possibility of 
immunotherapy-related pneumonitis with her and her pulmonologist. 
It's also important to consider the potential for other causes of her 
symptoms, such as pulmonary embolism or cardiac issues.  A 
cardiology consult might be helpful to rule out these possibilities.
AI
Good point. I'll add a cardiology consult to the list.  I think I have a good 
understanding of the next steps.  Thanks for your help, AMIE.
Strengths: 
AMIE correctly understands the possibility of disease recurrence, 
makes recommendations for further lab testing, imaging and 
more importantly, brings up the concern for 
pembrolizumab-mediated pneumonitis. AMIE even suggested 
appropriate therapies to consider here at disease progression.
Overall: 
Overall, this dialogue 
with the fellow was 
instructive, and very 
comprehensive.
(c) Feedback from breast oncologist
SCENARIO: A 55-year-old post-menopausal female is presenting to the breast oncology clinic for a routine yearly follow-up. She was 
diagnosed with triple negative (ER, PR and HER2 negative) breast cancer 3 years ago. At the time of diagnosis, she was treated with 
pembrolizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin (per KEYNOTE 522 trial), then underwent surgery. On surgical pathology report, she had 
complete pathological response. This was followed with adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment. Now after 3 years, she is experiencing weight 
loss, some difficulty breathing, chest discomfort and blurry vision.
FELLOW QUESTIONS:  Do I need any further information from the patient? If I have sufficient information, what are the next steps in 
diagnostic testing, imaging scans that may be needed or any specialty referrals for the patient.
AI
Yes, a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and 
tumor markers like CA 15-3 and CEA would be helpful to assess her 
overall health and look for any signs of disease recurrence.
AI
Oncology 
Fellow
AMIE
You're welcome!  It's important to remember that this is a complex case, and 
we should be prepared to adjust our approach based on the results of the 
tests and consultations.  I can provide you with further readings on clinical 
trials for triple-negative breast cancer and newly approved medications like 
sacituzumab govitecan and tucatinib, which may be relevant to her case.  
AI
Weaknesses: 
AMIE recommended screening with tumor markers such as CEA 
and CA 15-3. However, USPSTF and the ACS do not recommend 
routine screenings with tumor markers.  Additionally, while 
pembrolizumab-induced toxicities could have a long-term effect, 
pneumonitis does not emerge years later.

|42
(a) Scenario
(b) Example Dialogue
Hi AMIE, I'm a little confused about this hormonal 
therapy. Can you explain how it works?
Hi, I understand you're curious about hormonal therapy. It's a 
common treatment for breast cancer, especially in cases like 
yours where the cancer is ER and PR positive. 
AI
ER and PR positive? What does that mean?
ER and PR stand for estrogen receptor and progesterone 
receptor.  Your cancer cells have these receptors, meaning 
they are fueled by hormones like estrogen and progesterone. 
Hormonal therapy works by blocking these hormones or 
preventing them from reaching the cancer cells.
AI
 Exactly! By blocking the hormones, the 
cancer cells can't grow and spread as easily.
AI
AI
So, it's like starving the cancer?
That makes sense. But why is it necessary? I 
already had surgery to remove the tumor.
Okay, I understand. But how long do I have to take this therapy?
The duration of hormonal therapy varies depending on your 
individual case. Your doctor will consider factors like the size and 
stage of your cancer, your age, and your overall health. 
What about switching between 
treatments? When would that happen?
Sometimes, the cancer cells can become resistant to the initial 
hormonal therapy. In these cases, your doctor might 
recommend switching to a different type of hormonal therapy 
that targets the cancer cells in a different way.
AI
So, there are different types of hormonal therapy?
Yes, there are several different types of hormonal therapy medications, 
each with its own mechanism of action. Some block estrogen production, 
while others block estrogen from reaching the cancer cells.
AI
That's a lot to take in. Are there any side effects I should be aware of?
Strengths: 
AMIE explained the ER/PR receptors in a very patient-centered 
and accessible language. It also discussed the emerging 
side-effects, types of hormonal therapies, duration and 
summarized the questions to discuss with the physician.
Weaknesses:  
The discussion on types of hormonal therapies needs to be 
more detailed and include specific examples such as 
medications that patients may be taking already, or will 
start in near future.
(c) Feedback from breast oncologist
SCENARIO: A 45-year-old pre-menopausal female is presenting to the primary care clinic after having a bilateral mastectomy for a 2.5 cm 
ER and PR positive, HER2 negative mass. She wants to know about the mechanism of hormonal therapy, duration of therapy, and when to 
switch between treatments.
PATIENT QUESTIONS:  How does hormonal therapy works in breast cancer. Why is it necessary? Can you explain scenarios where 
hormonal therapy medications need to be switched?
AI
 Surgery is a crucial step, but it doesn't always remove all the 
cancer cells. Hormonal therapy helps to reduce the risk of the 
cancer coming back and spreading to other parts of your body.
Patient
AMIE
Yes, like any medication, hormonal therapy can have side 
effects. These can include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, bone 
loss, and mood changes. Your doctor will discuss these 
potential side effects with you and help you manage them.
AI
Thank you for explaining all this. I feel much more informed now.
You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Remember, it's 
important to discuss any concerns or questions you 
have with your doctor. They can provide personalized 
advice and guidance based on your specific situation.
AI
Overall:
Overall, a very 
comprehensive 
dialogue with a patient.
