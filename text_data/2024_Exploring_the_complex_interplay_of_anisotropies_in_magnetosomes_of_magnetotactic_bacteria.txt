Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are of significant interest for biophysical applications, particularly 
in cancer treatment. The biomineralized magnetosomes produced by these bacteria are high-
quality magnetic nanoparticles that form chains through a highly reproducible natural process. 
Specifically, Magnetovibrio blakemorei and Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense exhibit distinct 
magnetosome morphologies: truncated hexa-octahedral and truncated octahedral shapes, 
respectively. Despite having identical compositions (magnetite, Fe3O4) and comparable 
dimensions, their effective uniaxial anisotropies differ significantly, with M. blakemorei showing 
~25 kJ/m³ and M. gryphiswaldense ~11 kJ/m³ at 300K. This variation presents a unique 
opportunity to explore the role of different anisotropy contributions in the magnetic responses of 
magnetite-based nanoparticles. 
This study systematically investigates these responses by examining static magnetization as a 
function of temperature (M vs. T, 5 mT) and magnetic field (M vs. µ0H, up to 1 T). Above the 
Verwey transition temperature (~110 K), the effective anisotropy is dominated by shape 
anisotropy, notably increasing coercivity for M. blakemorei by up to two-fold compared to M. 
gryphiswaldense. Below this temperature, the effective uniaxial anisotropy increases non-
monotonically, significantly altering magnetic behavior. Our simulations based on dynamic 
Stoner-Wohlfarth models indicate that below the Verwey temperature, a uniaxial 
magnetocrystalline contribution emerges, peaking at 22-24 kJ/m³ at 5 K—values close to those of 
bulk magnetite. This demonstrates the profound impact of anisotropic properties on the magnetic 
behaviors and applications of magnetite-based nanoparticles and highlights the exceptional utility 
of magnetosomes as ideal model systems for studying the complex interplay of anisotropies in 
magnetite-based nanoparticles. 
Keywords: magnetotactic bacteria, magnetosomes, anisotropy, simulations, nanoparticles. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are unique aquatic microorganisms capable of directional 
movement guided by Earth's magnetic field [1–3]. This remarkable ability is due to the presence 
of intracellular magnetosomes. The latter are magnetic nanoparticles enclosed in a lipid bilayer, 
which tend to form chains inside the MTB, and are predominantly composed of magnetite (Fe3O4). 
Interestingly, these nanoparticles demonstrate a high degree of chemical purity and uniformity in 
size (35-120 nm), achieved through a naturally-driven biomineralization process that ensures 
reproducibility and magnetic stability of the magnetosomes at room temperature. [4,5].  
Recent years have witnessed burgeoning interest in MTB, mainly driven by the potential of 
magnetosomes in various biomedical applications, such as Magnetic Hyperthermia and Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI), and by the possibility of using MTB as remotely controlled 
microrobots [6–21]. Beyond their practical applications, magnetosomes serve as excellent subjects 
for fundamental nanomagnetic studies due to their consistent composition, size, shape, and 
arrangement. This precision allows them to model nanomagnetic phenomena, like the influence of 
dipolar interactions in one-dimensional assemblies or the effect of particle morphology on 
magnetic response at the nanoscale [22–25]. To this respect, our previous research utilized 
experimental techniques and computational methods to highlight the significant role of particle 
shape in determining the magnetic properties of faceted magnetosomes, specifically those 
synthesized by M. gryphiswaldense [25]. These studies revealed that magnetosomes from this 
species presented a slight deformation which tilted the magnetic moment out of the chain easy axis 
and allowed to accommodate the chain to the characteristic helical morphology of these bacteria. 
This deformation in the truncated octahedral shape of these magnetosomes crucially influence their 
magnetic response and heating efficiency in therapeutic applications like Magnetic Hyperthermia 
[26]. 
However, leveraging magnetosomes as model systems presents challenges, primarily because their 
morphology, governed by genetic factors, is species-specific and not readily modifiable like 
synthetic nanoparticles [27–31]. The diversity of MTB species and their magnetosome 
morphologies is vast, yet culturing these organisms in a laboratory setting remains a significant 
hurdle [32–35], limiting most research to a few species like Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense 
MSR-1 and Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 [36,37]. 
This study goes a step beyond by culturing and determining the anisotropy variations in 
Magnetovibrio blakemorei strain MV-1, which produces elongated Fe3O4 magnetosomes with a 
distinct truncated hexa-octahedral shape. This allows for a direct comparison of the magnetic 
properties with M. gryphiswaldense. First isolated by Bazylinski et al. in 1988 [38], M. blakemorei 
has been less studied due to the challenges associated with its cultivation [2,39–43]. 
This work presents a detailed analysis of the magnetic properties of M. blakemorei, comparing 
them with those of M. gryphiswaldense. Both species synthesize high-quality Fe3O4 
magnetosomes with comparable size but different shape. Our experiments, conducted with the 
magnetosomes intact within the bacteria, allow precise control over magnetic interactions and 
external conditions, enabling us to simulate and compare their magnetic responses under various 
temperatures. Utilizing experimental measurements focused on the collection of hysteresis loops 
across a wide range of temperatures (5 to 300 K), along with calculations based on a dynamic 
Stoner-Wohlfarth model, the thermal evolution of their magnetic anisotropies has been dissected, 
providing invaluable insights into the fundamental magnetic parameters that govern the behavior 
of magnetite-based nanoparticles of biotechnological interest. This study not only advances our 
understanding of MTB but also underscores the significance of magnetosomes as ideal model 
systems in nanomagnetic research, potentially benefiting various applications in the field of 
magnetic nanoparticles, not only restricted to biomedicine, but also expanding to emergent fields, 
like topological spin textures or bio-encoded magnonics [44]. 
 
2. Experimental 
2.1 Magnetotactic bacteria culture  
Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1 (DMSZ 6631) was grown without shaking at 28 °C in 
flask standard medium using 0.3% (wt/vol) of sodium pyruvate as carbon source and supplemented 
with 100 µM of Fe(III)-citrate (REF). [45].  
M. blakemorei strain MV-1 (DSM 18854) was grown anaerobically at 30°C in liquid medium 
containing per liter of artificial seawater (ASW): 4 g Na succinate x 6H2O, 0.8 g Na acetate, 1 g 
casamino acids (BD Bacto), 1 g NH4Cl, 5 mL Wolfe’s mineral solution and 50 µL of 1%(w/v) 
resazurine. After autoclaving, 0.5 mL BME Vitamins 100x solution (Sigma-Aldrich, B6891), 1.8 
mL 0.5 M PO4 buffer, 0.3 mL Fe(II)-Cl2 and 10 mL of 0.25 M freshly made cysteine solution were 
added to the media and the pH was adjusted to 7. The media was then distributed into sterile 
Hungate tubes and fluxed for 20 minutes with N2O. 
Once bacteria present well-formed magnetosome chains, the cells were harvested by 
centrifugation, fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, washed three times with PBS and finally suspended 
in Milli-Q water. 
2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on whole bacteria (i.e., whole cells) 
deposited onto 300 mesh carbon-coated copper grids. The images were obtained with a JEOL 
JEM-14000 Plus electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. The particle size 
distribution was analyzed with ImageJ software [46].  
2.3 Magnetic measurements 
The magnetic characterization was carried out using the whole bacteria. The samples were freeze-
dried and encapsulated in gelatin capsules. Magnetic measurements were performed in a 
superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS-5). 
Magnetization vs. temperature (M vs. T) curves were measured following the usual zero-field-
cooling/field-cooling (ZFC/FC) protocol, with an applied magnetic field of 5 mT. Magnetization 
vs. magnetic field (M vs. µ0H) loops were measured both in ZFC and FC modes, at different 
temperatures, 5–300 K, applying magnetic fields, µ0H, up to 1 T.  
 
3. Results and Discussion 
Figure 1 shows representative TEM images of the M. blakemorei and M. gryphiswaldense 
bacteria, and their chain of magnetosomes. As depicted, both species synthesize a single chain of 
magnetosomes, but in the case of M. blakemorei, these magnetosomes present an elongated 
truncated hexa-octahedral shape (see the inset to Figure 1) which differs from the truncated 
octahedral shape typically obtained for M. gryphiswaldense and other species of the genus 
Magnetospirillum. In both cases, the magnetosomes inside the chain are aligned along a [111] 
crystallographic direction of magnetite, which defines the so-called chain axis [22]. Concerning 
the chain of magnetosomes, it is noticeable that the length of the chain is larger in the case of M. 
gryphiswaldense with an average of 15(3) magnetosomes per chain, while in the case of M. 
blakemorei, the average number of magnetosomes reduces to 9(2). On the other hand, the 
dimensions of the magnetosomes from M. blakemorei, as determined from the corresponding TEM 
images, are 45(4) × 45(4) × 65(5) nm3, while the truncated octahedral magnetosomes from M. 
gryphiswaldense have an average size of 45(5) nm. Despite the differences in their morphology, 
both magnetosomes present comparable dimensions. 
 
Figure 1. TEM images of the M. blakemorei and M. gryphiswaldense bacteria. The chain of 
magnetosomes can be clearly identified inside the bacteria. In the insets, a zoom-in of the chain is 
presented to showcase the different morphology of the magnetosomes from the two species.  
 
The different morphology of both strains results, naturally, in different shape anisotropy 
contributions. The shape anisotropy energy landscape has been calculated using a Finite Element 
Method (FEM) protocol described in detail before (see Refs [23,25]), and the main results are 
summarized in Figure 2. This figure presents a schematic depiction of the morphology of each 
magnetosome, with the corresponding crystallographic axes and shape anisotropy energy 
landscape. In Ref [25], by using FEM, we showed that the magnetosomes synthesized by M. 
gryphiswaldense present a slight deformation that gives rise to a deformed toroidal energy 
landscape, with a unique quasi-uniaxial character (i.e., a main uniaxial contribution + a smaller 
cubic contribution). This quasi-uniaxial easy axis is effectively tilted ~20° out of the [111] chain 
axis, as represented in Figure 2, and the corresponding shape anisotropy constant values are Ksh–
uni ~ 7 kJ m−3 and Ksh–cub ~ 1.5 kJ m−3 at 300 K.  Instead, in the case of M. blakemorei [23], the 
shape anisotropy energy landscape exhibits a perfect toroidal shape indicating the presence of a 
well-defined uniaxial easy axis along the chain axis direction. These magnetosomes exhibit some 
dispersion in their aspect ratio, i.e., width/length (W/L), with an average value: W/L = 0.70(6), 
which gives rise to a uniaxial shape anisotropy constant value of Ksh–uni ~ 23(4) kJ m−3 at 300 K. 
Therefore, these results clearly display that the elongated morphology of M. blakemorei 
magnetosomes gives rise to a stronger and strictly uniaxial shape anisotropy compared to M. 
gryphiswaldense. This is going to have an important impact on their magnetic response, as we will 
see below.

(left) and M. gryphiswaldense (right), including the crystallographic axes. The [111] direction 
corresponds with the chain axis of the MTB. (Bottom) Corresponding shape anisotropy energy 
landscapes, which have been calculated following the procedure described in Gandia et al [25]. 
 
To probe the influence of the different anisotropy energy landscapes on the magnetic properties, 
static magnetic measurements have been carried out, both as a function of the temperature (M vs. 
T) and as a function of the magnetic field (M vs. µ0H), from 5 to 300 K. Figure 3 a) showcases 
the M vs. T curves measured in the ZFC/FC mode at low fields, 5 mT, for both species. These 
ZFC/FC curves present a qualitatively similar behavior in both cases: there is a strong 
irreversibility between the ZFC and FC curves, and a sharp transition appears in both curves around 
100-110 K, which corresponds to the well-known Verwey transition of magnetite [47–49]. As has 
been explained before, this is a temperature phase transition in which magnetite crystal lattice 
changes from cubic to monoclinic with decreasing temperature, and the magnetocrystalline 
anisotropy changes from cubic to uniaxial. The presence of the Verwey transition in the ZFC/FC 
curves is a clear indicator of the magnetosomes being made of Fe3O4. In bulk magnetite, this 
transition gives rise to a sharp step around Tv = 120 K [50,51]. However, in magnetosomes, and in 
other high quality magnetite nanoparticles, this transition tends to be slightly shifted and smoothed. 
This can be in principle related to the stoichiometry moving away from that of pure magnetite due 
to the presence of vacancies, defects, or doping elements [52–54]. In our case, the Verwey 
temperature is shifted ~ 10 K towards lower temperatures for both species. This can be more easily 
discerned if we inspect the first derivative of the ZFC curves (Figure 3 b)), where a well-defined 
peak appears around 90-100 K, corresponding to the Verwey transition. This peak is slightly 
sharper for M. blakemorei, suggesting a more homogenous stoichiometry. This is also supported 
by the value of the onset of the Verwey temperature (marked with black arrows): Tv ~ 112 K for 
M. blakemorei, slightly closer to the expected bulk value, Tv ~120 K, than for M. gryphiswaldense, 
Tv ~ 107 K. In addition, as marked by the change in the slope of the ZFC curves and the second 
peak in the derivative, a second transition appears around 30-50 K. These correspond to the so-
called “low-T transitions”, frequently reported in bulk magnetite and magnetite-based 
nanoparticles, although their nature is still under debate [55–60]. As depicted in the derivative, 
there are some small differences in the shape and position (marked by white arrows) of this low T 
peak, around Tlow-T ~ 27 K and ~ 30 K for M. blakemorei and M. gryphiswaldense, respectively. 
Therefore, these results indicate similar crystallographic transitions in both magnetosomes despite 
their marked difference in morphology.

in text, i.e. low-T transition (white arrows) and Verwey transition (black arrows). 
 
Next, in order to gain a better insight into the complex interplay of anisotropies in these two MTB 
species, their magnetic response as a function of the applied magnetic field has been analyzed by 
measuring the M vs. µ0H loops up to 1 T at different temperatures between 5 and 300 K, both in 
ZFC and FC modes for M. blakemorei (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information). Briefly, above 
Tv, the ZFC and FC hysteresis loops are nearly identical, but as the temperature decreases, the FC 
loops show lower coercivity and higher remanence than the ZFC loops; additionally, M. 
blakemorei exhibits wider loops with higher irreversibility than M. gryphiswaldense, indicative of 
higher effective anisotropy. To better analyze the differences, in Figure 4 we have represented the 
thermal evolution of the coercive field, µ0Hc (left), and the normalized magnetization remanence, 
Mr/Ms (right) for both species.  
 
Figure 4. Thermal evolution of the a) ZFC and b) FC Coercive field, µ0Hc, d) ZFC and e) FC 
normalized remanence, Mr/Ms, vs temperature curves obtained from the corresponding M vs. µ0H 
loops. The difference, in absolute value, between these FC and ZFC curves is represented in c) for 
the coercive field, |Δ µ0Hc|, and in f) for the normalized remanence, |ΔMr/Ms|. 
 
The evolution of µ0Hc with temperature (Figures 4 a), b)) is qualitatively similar for both bacteria 
species, but the obtained values are appreciably higher (up to 2 times greater) for M. blakemorei. 
This enhanced coercivity can be directly associated to the higher shape anisotropy of M. 
blakemorei, since it is proportional to the anisotropy: Hc = 2K/µ0Ms for single domain uniaxial 
nanoparticles, following a coherent rotation or Stoner-Wohlfarth mode during the reversal of the 
magnetization [61]. This shows that modifying the shape of MNPs is a powerful strategy to tune 
the coercive field, which is especially interesting in different applications such as magnetic 
hyperthermia or data storage [28,30,62,63]. Concerning the thermal evolution, we can see that µ0Hc-
ZFC remains nearly constant (µ0Hc-ZFC = 40 mT and 20 mT for M. blakemorei and M. 
gryphiswaldense, respectively) from 300 K down to ~110 K, that is, Tv. In the case of bulk 
magnetite, the coercive field steeply increases below Tv, and then remains nearly constant [64], 
which is related to the sharp transition taking place: with decreasing temperature, the 
magnetocrystalline anisotropy changes from cubic (Kcub = -11 kJ/m3 and ⟨111⟩ easy axes) to 
essentially uniaxial (Kuni = +25 kJ/m3 and ⟨100⟩ easy axes) as the crystalline structure evolves from 
cubic to monoclinic, giving rise to a sudden increase in the coercive field [65]. However, in the 
case of magnetosomes and many other magnetite-based nanoparticles [52,66,67], this process is, 
unsurprisingly, less abrupt and more complex than in bulk. Here, we can see µ0Hc-ZFC first increases 
below Tv, then there is a shoulder around 70-75 K, and finally increases again below 40-45 K, 
reaching a maximum value at 5 K of 80 mT and 70 mT for M. blakemorei and M. gryphiswaldense, 
respectively. A similar behavior, albeit smoother, is obtained for the µ0Hc-FC curves (Figure 4 b)). 
The differences between both MTB can be better tracked by representing the relative change of 
the coercive field, |Δµ0Hc| vs T curves (Figure 4 c)). As depicted, the curves nearly overlap for 
both samples, indicating that, despite the difference in coercive field values, the magnetic response 
and the magnetic transitions taking place are very similar. However, there are minor differences 
below 70 K, which indicate some changes in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of both samples, 
as had already been showcased in the M vs. T curves. 
Focusing now on the normalized remanence, on the one hand, it can be observed that the ZFC 
Mr/MS-ZFC (Figure 4 d)) remains fairly constant for both MTB species: for M. gryphiswaldense, 
Mr/MS-ZFC ~ 0.44 from 300 K down to 110 K, and then it increases up to Mr/MS-ZFC ~ 0.49 at 5 K; 
while for M. blakemorei, Mr/MS-ZFC ~ 0.48 from 300 K down to 110 K, and then increases up to 
0.50. These values are close to ~0.5, indicating that, overall, these magnetosomes behave like 
randomly-oriented uniaxial single domain magnetic nanoparticles, as typically described in the 
framework of the Stoner-Wohlfarth model [68]. This behavior is more closely followed by the 
elongated magnetosomes from M. blakemorei, as expected, due to their better-defined uniaxial 
shape anisotropy. On the other hand, in the case of the FC remanence values, Mr/MS-FC, (Figure 4 
e)) we can see, however, some clear changes. For M. gryphiswaldense, Mr/MS-FC increases abruptly 
from 0.44 below the Verwey transition up to 0.72 at 5 K. Noticeably, a shoulder around 60 K, 
resembling the one observed in the µ0Hc vs T curves, is also present in these Mr/MS-FC vs T curves. 
On the other hand, for M. blakemorei, we see a more progressive evolution: Mr/MS-FC remains 
nearly constant, ~0.48, from 300 K to 160 K, and then it increases up to 0.65 at 5 K. The relative 
change of the normalized remanence, |ΔMr/MS| vs. T (Figure 4 f)) allows to better detect the 
differences between both MTB. Above Tv, |ΔMr/MS| is null for both species, but below Tv, a 
progressive increase in |ΔMr/MS| is obtained, more abrupt in the case of M. gryphiswaldense. 
Therefore, these results indicate that, despite the similarities between both MTB, there are some 
clear differences in their magnetic response, which can be related to the various anisotropies 
influencing the magnetic behavior of these bacteria. To fully capture the physics underneath, 
computing simulations of the experimental M vs. µ0H loops have been carried out. These 
simulations are based on a magnetic model that has been described before in detail in previous 
studies [69,70]. Each magnetosome in the chain is considered as a single domain magnetic moment. 
For a given magnetic field at a fixed temperature, the equilibrium configuration of these magnetic 
moments is determined calculated by minimizing the single dipole energy density, given as the 
sum of three contributions: (i) the effective cubic anisotropy energy density (Ecub), due to the 
magnetocrystalline anisotropy above Tv and the small cubic contribution to the shape anisotropy 
for M. gryphiswaldense; (ii) the effective uniaxial anisotropy energy density (Euni), arising from 
the competition between magnetosome shape anisotropy and dipolar interactions within the chain 
(across all temperatures), including the magnetocrystalline anisotropy contribution below Tv; and 
(iii) the Zeeman energy density term (EZ). Considering, 𝜃𝜃 and 𝜑𝜑 the polar and azimuthal angles of 
the magnetic moment of each magnetosome, with the 〈100〉 magnetite crystallographic directions 
as reference, the total energy density is given by: 
𝐸𝐸(𝜃𝜃, 𝜑𝜑) = 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝜃𝜃, 𝜑𝜑) + 𝐸𝐸𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢(𝜃𝜃, 𝜑𝜑) + 𝐸𝐸𝑍𝑍(𝜃𝜃, 𝜑𝜑)  
 
(1) 
where:  
𝐸𝐸cub(𝜃𝜃, 𝜑𝜑) =
𝐾𝐾cub
4 [sin4(𝜃𝜃) sin2(2𝜑𝜑) + sin2(2𝜃𝜃)]  
(2) 
𝐸𝐸uni(𝜃𝜃, 𝜑𝜑) = 𝐾𝐾uni[1 −(𝑢𝑢ොm ∙𝑢𝑢ොuni)2]  
(3) 
𝐸𝐸Z(𝜃𝜃, 𝜑𝜑) = −𝜇𝜇0𝑀𝑀𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻(𝑢𝑢ොm ∙𝑢𝑢ොH) 
 
(4) 
being 𝐾𝐾cub the effective cubic anisotropy constant; 𝐾𝐾uni the effective uniaxial anisotropy constant; 
𝑢𝑢ොm the magnetic moment unit vector; 𝑢𝑢ොuni the unit vector along the effective uniaxial easy axis; 
𝑢𝑢ොH the external magnetic field unit vector; and 𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠 the spontaneous magnetization of magnetite, 
𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠=48x104 A/m. As we mentioned before (see Figure 2), the magnetosomes from M. 
gryphiswaldense present a quasi-uniaxial easy axis, 𝑢𝑢ොuni, which is tilted ~20° out of the [111] 
chain axis, due to a slight deformation of their truncated octahedral shape [25]. However, for the 
magnetosomes from M. blakemorei, 𝑢𝑢ොuni is clearly pointing along the [111] chain axis due to their 
elongated shape. Taking into account these considerations, the M vs. µ0H loops at different angles 
have been simulated, using a dynamic approach described by Carrey et al [70], and averaged in 
order to reproduce the experimentally obtained ZFC M vs. µ0H loops corresponding to randomly 
oriented MTB. In this way, for each loop at a certain temperature, Kcub and Kuni have been adjusted 
to attain the best match between experimental and simulated M vs. µ0H loops.  
The experimental and simulated ZFC M vs. µ0H loops obtained at 5, 115, and 300 K for M. 
blakemorei and M. gryphiswaldense using this model have been represented in Figure 5 a). As 
depicted, an excellent match between experimental values and simulations has been reached in all 
cases by properly tuning the values of Kcub and Kuni. Similar results have been obtained for the rest 
of the temperatures. These have allowed us to plot the thermal evolution of both anisotropy 
constants, as depicted in Figures 5 b), c). Interestingly, while in the case of M. gryphiswaldense 
both Kcub and Kuni need to be included in the model in order to obtain a good fitting above Tv, in 
the case of M. blakemorei, only Kuni needs to be taken into consideration in the whole temperature 
range. For the later, the strong uniaxial anisotropy energy, 𝐸𝐸uni, in the [111] direction makes the 
cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, 𝐸𝐸cub, irrelevant for these calculations, and the shape 
of the calculated M vs. µ0H loops does not change by including the 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 term. Therefore, we have 
not considered this term for M. blakemorei, and only the effective uniaxial anisotropy term, 𝐸𝐸uni, 
has been included in the simulations of this species, with a Gaussian distribution to take into 
account the aspect ratio dispersion existing in these specific magnetosomes (i.e., W/L = 0.70(6)). 
This explains why Kcub is only represented for M. gryphiswaldense in Figure 5 b).

M. blakemorei and M. gryphiswaldense. Thermal evolution of the effective b) cubic anisotropy 
(Kcub) and c) uniaxial anisotropy (Kuni) as obtained from the simulations.  
 
The thermal evolution of the cubic contribution to the anisotropy, Kcub, is mainly related to the 
magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Although it is true that magnetosomes from M. gryphiswaldense 
present a non-negligible cubic contribution to the shape anisotropy, Ksh–cub = 1.5 kJ m−3 at 300 K 
[25], this value is nearly one order of magnitude smaller than the magnetocrystalline contribution. 
In Figure 5 b), it can be observed that at room temperature, the obtained value of Kcub is around -
11.0 kJ m-3, close to the expected Kcub value for bulk magnetite, -10.8 kJ m-3. This serves as a 
reminder of the well-known high structural quality of these magnetosomes. With decreasing 
temperature, Kcub slowly increases in absolute value up to -12.5 kJ m-3 at 180 K. After that, it 
rapidly decreases in absolute value until becoming null at 110 K, around the Verwey transition.  
Concerning the thermal evolution of the uniaxial contribution, Kuni, it is important to recall that, 
above the Verwey temperature, it gathers two contributions: the shape uniaxial anisotropy (Ksh-uni) 
and the dipolar interactions between magnetosomes inside the chain (Kdip). On the other hand, 
below the Verwey temperature, a third contribution should appear, associated with 
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, as explained before. In Figure 5 b), already at 300 K, we can see 
some clear differences between the two species analyzed in this work: the Kuni value for M. 
blakemorei (~ 25 kJ m-3) is appreciably higher than the one obtained for M. gryphiswaldense (~ 
11 kJ m-3). Since the values for the shape anisotropy of both magnetosomes at 300 K have been 
already calculated using our FEM model [25] (~7 kJ m-3 for M. gryphiswaldense and ~23 kJ m-3 for 
M. blakemorei), we can directly obtain an estimation of the effective dipolar anisotropy (Kdip = 
Kuni - Ksh-uni), being Kdip ~4 kJ m-3 for M. gryphiswaldense and  ~2 kJ m-3 for M. blakemorei.  
From 300 K to 110 K, i.e., down to the Verwey transition, Kuni remains almost constant for both 
species (there is a slight increase in the case of M. gryphiswaldense). This indicates that the thermal 
dependence of both shape and dipolar anisotropies, in this range of temperatures, is relatively 
small. However, below the Verwey temperature, Kuni increases from 12 to 36 kJ m-3 at 5 K for M. 
gryphiswaldense, and from 25 to 48 kJ m-3 at 5 K in the case of M. blakemorei. The evolution of 
Kuni vs T below the Verwey transition follows the same qualitative trend we saw for µ0Hc vs T: a 
first increase with a shoulder between 75-35 K, approximately, and a second increase below that 
temperature down to 5 K. This increase in Kuni is associated, as explained before, with the change 
in magnetocrystalline anisotropy, from cubic to uniaxial.  
Concerning the shape and dipolar anisotropies, as it is well known, their thermal dependence 
should be proportional to thermal evolution of 𝑀𝑀𝑆𝑆
2 [61]. Our results indicate that above the Verwey 
temperature, the saturation magnetization roughly follows a Bloch-like law, 𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠(𝑇𝑇) ∝𝑀𝑀0[1 −
ቀ
𝑇𝑇
𝑇𝑇0ቁ
𝛼𝛼𝐵𝐵], being 𝑀𝑀0 the saturation magnetization at 0 K, 𝑇𝑇0 the temperature at which 𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠 becomes 
null, i.e. the Curie temperature (~843 K for magnetite), and 𝛼𝛼𝐵𝐵 is a Bloch-like exponent (see 
Figure S2). In our case 𝛼𝛼𝐵𝐵 acquires a value ~2.65. Note that the slight experimental drop in 𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠(𝑇𝑇) 
below the Verwey transition obtained in Figure S2 has been previously described in bulk 
magnetite [64]. By using the values obtained from our calculations for 𝐾𝐾𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 and 𝐾𝐾𝑠𝑠ℎ−𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢 at 300 K 
as starting points, and considering that the thermal evolution of both anisotropies should be 
proportional to 𝑀𝑀𝑆𝑆
2(𝑇𝑇), we have applied the same Bloch-like law for the shape and dipolar 
contributions, thereby obtaining the following expressions: 
𝐾𝐾dip(𝑇𝑇) = 𝐾𝐾dip0 ቂ1 −ቀ
𝑇𝑇
𝑇𝑇0ቁ
𝛼𝛼𝐵𝐵ቃ

𝐾𝐾sh−uni(𝑇𝑇) = 𝐾𝐾sh−uni0 ቂ1 −ቀ
𝑇𝑇
𝑇𝑇0ቁ
𝛼𝛼𝐵𝐵ቃ

    (6) 
where 𝐾𝐾𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑0 and 𝐾𝐾𝑠𝑠ℎ−𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢0 are the extrapolated dipolar and shape anisotropy constant values at 0 
K, respectively.  
This is more clearly illustrated in Figure 6, where the thermal evolution of the shape, dipolar, and 
magnetocrystalline to the effective uniaxial anisotropy constant, Kuni, have been represented 
separately for both species. As depicted, for the shape and dipolar contributions, the change 
between 300 K and 5 K is very small, < 10%.  By subtracting both shape and dipolar contributions 
from Ku, we can obtain the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy contribution for each species. 
As depicted, the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy contributions for both MTB species follow 
a qualitatively similar evolution, much more complex than the shape and dipolar counterparts. 
Above Tv, the uniaxial magnetocrystalline contribution is null, as expected, but below Tv, it 
progressively increases with decreasing temperature following a non-monotonic trend. First it 
rapidly increases up to ~8-10 kJ m-3 at 70 K, then it describes a shoulder, reaching ~12-14 kJ m-3 
at 40 K, and finally it increases again up to ~22-24 kJ m-3 at 5 K. 
This behavior clearly differs from the one obtained in stoichiometric bulk magnetite, in which the 
transition from a cubic to a monoclinic structure is sharp, and the monoclinic phase exhibits a 
uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of ~27 kJ m-3 at 5 K [51,65]. In the case of 
magnetosomes, only at 5 K, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy contribution practically recovers 
the bulk magnetite value. Therefore, these results indicate that in magnetosomes and other similar 
high-quality magnetite-based nanoparticles, instead of having an abrupt Verwey transition in a 
very narrow range of temperature, the transition is slower and more complex, as described before. 
Interestingly, this evolution of the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy resembles the one from 
the ZFC curves (see Figure S3), suggesting that the “low T transition” appearing around 30-50 K 
in these and other magnetite-based nanoparticles could be linked to the change in the uniaxial 
magnetocrystalline anisotropy evolution observed around the same range of temperatures. The 
reasons behind this complex behavior could be related to the presence of a distribution of defects, 
vacancies, and/or doping elements in the crystalline structure of these nanoparticles. It is well-
known that magnetite is greatly affected but tiny structural modifications [60,71]. These structural 
modifications could contribute to a progressive change in the crystalline structure, from cubic to 
monoclinic with decreasing temperature, although further experiments would be needed to shed 
more light on this matter. 
It is important to emphasize that this distinction of individual contributions from experimental 
measurements represents a significant achievement, as such differentiation is often exceedingly 
difficult with other magnetite-based nanoparticles. This underscores the exceptional utility of 
magnetosomes as ideal model magnetic nanoparticles.

4. Conclusion 
In this study, we successfully isolated and analyzed the diverse anisotropic contributions affecting 
the magnetic properties of magnetite-based nanoparticles. Using magnetosomes from two MTB 
species, M. gryphiswaldense and M. blakemorei, which display similar composition, dimensions 
and crystallinity, but very different shape (Ksh ~7 kJ/m³ and ~23 kJ/m³ at 300 K, respectively), we 
conducted a comparative analysis while maintaining consistency in other influential parameters. 
The dipolar interactions contributed a minor uniaxial anisotropy of approximately 2-4 kJ/m³ at 300 
K. Despite minimal thermal variations in both shape and dipolar anisotropies across the examined 
temperature range, the differences in shape anisotropy between both species markedly influenced 
the M vs H loops, notably enhancing the coercivity for M. blakemorei by up to two-fold compared 
to M. gryphiswaldense. This underscores the critical role of shape anisotropy in modifying 
magnetic hysteresis in nanoparticles, which is especially relevant for applications of these 
nanoparticles in different fields, including biomedicine. 
Furthermore, the uniaxial contribution of magnetocrystalline anisotropy was found to 
predominantly affect the magnetic behavior at lower temperatures. Through computations using a 
dynamic Stoner-Wohlfarth model, we were able to distinctly separate and trace the thermal 
evolution of the various anisotropic contributions: shape, dipolar, and magnetocrystalline. 
Notably, the intricate magnetic behavior observed in magnetosomes and other magnetite-based 
nanoparticles below the Verwey transition (Tv ~110-120 K) is governed by a non-monotonic 
increase in uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy as temperature decreases. This triggers a 
progressive Verwey transition, with the magnetite structure transitioning from cubic to monoclinic, 
nearly culminating at temperatures around 5 K, where the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy 
(~22-24 kJ/m³) approximates the values found in bulk magnetite. Despite the similar behavior in 
both species, our method has allowed us to pinpoint small differences in the magnetocrystalline 
anisotropy of their magnetosomes. 
These findings highlight the exceptional utility of magnetosomes as ideal model nanoparticles for 
detailed studies, where a combination of experimental measurements and computational 
simulations facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the different factors influencing the 
magnetic responses of nanoparticles. This work not only enhances our understanding of magnetic 
nanoparticle behavior but also demonstrates the potential applications of magnetosomes in 
nanomagnetic research.
