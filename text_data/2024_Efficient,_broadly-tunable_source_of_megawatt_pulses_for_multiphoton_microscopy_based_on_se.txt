Abstract:
An exciting recent development for deep-tissue imaging with cellular resolution
is three-photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM) with excitation at long wavelengths (1300 and
1700 nm). In the last few years, long-wavelength 3PM has driven rapid progress in deep-
tissue imaging beyond the depth limit of two-photon microscopy, with impacts in neuroscience,
immunology, and cancer biology. However, wide adoption of 3PM faces challenges. Three-
photon excitation (3PE) is naturally weaker than two-photon excitation, which places a premium
on ultrashort pulses with high peak power. The inefficiency, complexity, and cost of current
sources of these pulses present major barriers to the use of 3PM in typical biomedical research
labs. Here, we describe a fiber-based source of femtosecond pulses with multi-megawatt peak
power, tunable from 850 nm to 1700 nm. Compressed pulses from a fiber amplifier at 1030 nm
are launched into an antiresonant hollow-core fiber filled with argon. By varying only the gas
pressure, pulses with hundreds of nanojoules of energy and sub-100 fs duration are obtained at
wavelengths between 850 and 1700 nm. This approach is a new route to an efficient, robust, and
potentially low-cost source for multiphoton deep-tissue imaging. In particular, 960-nJ and 50-fs
pulses are generated at 1300 nm with a conversion efficiency of 10%. The nearly 20-MW peak
power is an order of magnitude higher than the previous best from femtosecond fiber source at
1300 nm. As an example of the capabilities of the source, these pulses are used to image structure
and neuronal activity in mouse brain as deep as 1.1 mm below the dura.
1.
Introduction
Lasers based on doped silica fibers offer many advantages, such as excellent thermal properties,
nearly diffraction-limited beam quality, compactness, and mechanical stability. They have
found applications in various areas, such as material processing, medicine, and nonlinear
microscopy [1,2]. Many of these applications benefit from a high peak power, which makes
short-pulse fiber lasers especially useful. At repetition rates of a few hundred kilohertz, fiber
chirped-pulse amplifier (CPA) systems can robustly provide sub-picosecond pulses with tens or
even hundreds of microjoules of energy [3–5], enabling high optical intensity.
However, fiber lasers and amplifiers suffer from two significant drawbacks. First, they have
arXiv:2410.00889v1  [physics.optics]  1 Oct 2024
limited wavelength tunability. Easily-obtainable fibers are typically doped with ytterbium,
neodymium, erbium, or thulium, which have limited emission bandwidths centered at 1030 nm,
1064 nm, 1550 nm, and 2000 nm, respectively. Thus, fiber lasers are not directly suitable for
applications that require other wavelengths. Second, optical fibers have long lengths of interaction
between the light and the material guiding it. This can exacerbate dispersive and nonlinear effects,
which can distort a pulse of light. Since the fibers are typically silica, self-focusing precludes
them from supporting pulses with peak powers higher than a few megawatts, and various other
nonlinear effects can degrade the temporal profile of pulses even at much lower peak powers.
Thus, pulses emitted from fiber laser systems are typically limited to more modest energies and
peak powers than pulses from their solid-state counterparts.
Three-photon fluorescence microscopy enables imaging with cellular resolution deep in
scattering tissue. Ultrashort pulses with peak power above 1 MW are required for efficient
fluorescence excitation, and the optimal wavelengths for deep imaging are around 1300 and
1700 nm [6]. The most-common sources of pulses for three-photon microscopy convert pulses
from Yb-based lasers at 1050 nm to the desired wavelengths through noncollinear optical
parametric amplification (NOPA) in bulk crystals.
Commercial versions typically have a
conversion efficiency (to 1300 nm) of 4% or lower [7,8]. The pulses that drive the conversion
process must therefore be very energetic, which limits the repetition rates that can be achieved.
More-efficient and fiber-based sources would be attractive for multiphoton microscopy, but to
date fiber sources have not reached the performance of NOPA systems.
Researchers have implemented various wavelength-conversion techniques in fiber. These
include optical parametric amplification [9], Raman amplification [10], soliton self-frequency
shift [11], and continuum generation [12, 13], to name a few. Since these processes exploit
nonlinear propagation, they can actually benefit from a long nonlinear interaction length. However,
excessive nonlinear phase shifts can still lead to pulse degradation, and with solid-core fiber the
peak power is limited to around 1 MW [6,14,15]. To enable high-power nonlinear processes in
optical fiber, researchers have been turning to hollow-core fibers filled with various gases [16–24].
Gases generally have much lower nonlinear refractive indices than glasses, which allows scaling
of pulse energy to much higher peak power, while the waveguide structure provides long nonlinear
interaction length. Moreover, because the nonlinearity and dispersion a pulse experiences in gas
depend upon the gas pressure–which an experimenter can vary–gas offers a level of tunability
absent from solid-core fiber.
Continuum generation in solid material, gas [25], or solid-core fiber [26], is a ubiquitous
approach to generating light in a wide range of wavelengths. Once the continuum is generated,
a spectral interval within it can be selected for use in applications. This approach has been
used as early as the 1970s [27], and has more recently been studied systematically as a way to
provide tunable pulses for nonlinear microscopy as well as other applications [28,29]. When the
continuum is created mainly by self-phase modulation (SPM) in optical fiber, the method has
been referred to as "self-phase-modulation-enabled spectral selection" (SESS) [28,29]. SPM
offers certain advantages over the other wavelength-conversion processes mentioned above:
wavelength tunability without a need for phase-matching, pulses at multiple wavelengths are
generated simultaneously, and the possibility of generating nearly transform-limited pulses at the
desired wavelengths. When implemented with glass fiber it has provided pulses of megawatt peak
power with wavelengths of 1300 nm and 1700 nm [14], and SESS-generated pulses have proven
to be useful in multiphoton microscopy [30]. However, because the mode area of single-mode
fiber is limited, there is no route to scaling to significantly-higher powers in solid fiber. This
motivates the extension of SESS to gas-filled hollow fiber. SPM in hollow fibers filled with
atomic gas has been studied numerically assuming femtosecond input pulses at 1030 nm [31].
Experimentally, wavelength shifts of a few tens of nanometers have been used to improve the
temporal contrast of a pulse [32]. However, there is no prior report of experimental generation of
broadly-tunable pulses using this approach.
Here we present a wavelength-tunable source of multi-megawatt pulses based on self-phase
modulation in argon-filled hollow-core fiber. With 10-µJ and 100-fs pulses at 1030 nm, we
generate coherent pulses with central wavelengths between 850 nm and 1700 nm and peak powers
well above 1 MW. The results include the production of 960-nJ and 50-fs (>10 MW) pulses at
1300 nm, with about 10% conversion efficiency. The effectiveness of this source is illustrated by
the use of the 1300-nm pulses to image structure and neuronal activity deep in a mouse brain
using three-photon microscopy.
2.
Experimental Setup
Because we desire strong nonlinear interaction with modest pulse energy, an anti-resonant
hollow-core fiber (ARHCF) with a relatively-small core diameter of 30 µm was chosen to guide
the light while it interacts with the gas. This is the same fiber used in a prior work [33]. It
allows single-mode (with very low overlap between the light and the glass structures), low-loss
propagation at wavelengths between 800 nm and 1700 nm (Figure 1(c)) and is held in a pair of
gas cells (Figure 1(a)). Ar was chosen as the gas because its response is purely electronic and it
is readily available.
When evacuated, the ARHCF has a zero-dispersion wavelength near the resonance at 700 nm
and anomalous dispersion at longer wavelengths; when filled with a normally-dispersive gas–as Ar
is at the studied wavelengths–the zero-dispersion wavelength can be shifted to longer wavelengths.
At the gas pressures used here, the waveguide still has anomalous dispersion at 1030 nm, which
can create solitons in conjunction with the Kerr nonlinearity; however, it is generally desirable to
avoid soliton formation in SPM-based spectral broadening. Operation with short segments of
fiber and high gas pressures helps to avoid soliton formation: the dispersion is closer to zero, and
the length of fiber may be chosen so short that the field is not able to evolve to a soliton solution.
Our current experimental setup cannot support a fiber shorter than 24 cm, so this length was used
in the experiments.
An all-normal dispersion oscillator with a repetition rate of 31 MHz provides the initial pulses.
These are stretched to a few hundred picoseconds duration in a chirped fiber Bragg grating and
the repetition rate is reduced to 200 kHz. The pulses are amplified in three stages, the last being
a rod-type single-mode waveguide [34], and are then dechirped in a volume Bragg grating to
yield 18-µJ and 300-fs pulses.
The effects of self-phase modulation strongly depend on the duration of the input pulse. We
find, both in simulations and experiments, that SPM broadening of few-microjoule, 300-fs pulses
does not generate useful light at the desired wavelengths if the argon pressure is below 100 bar.
However, pulses about 100 fs long or shorter do yield the needed spectral broadening. Thus, a
multi-plate compressor (MPC) [35,36] was used to compress the pulses from the amplifier. The
MPC consists of 12 thin N-SF11 plates and a dispersive delay line. The beam from the CPA is
focused onto the N-SF11 plates, where it spectrally broadens. The dispersive delay then removes
the slight chirp induced on the pulse. The 300-fs pulses from the fiber amplifier can thus be
compressed to between 60 fs and 100 fs. Pulses produced by the MPC had an energy of 10 µJ
and linear polarization. Around 7 µJ was coupled into the ARHCF, which was filled with various
pressures of Ar. The output from the ARHCF was filtered spectrally and the temporal profile
of the filtered light was measured by frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) for the pulses
centered at wavelengths less than 1700 nm, and with a home-built interferometric autocorrelator
for pulses at 1700 nm.
Pulses from the ARHCF were directed to a custom-built three-photon fluorescence microscope
similar to the ones used in previous work [37–39]. A pair of prisms was used to pre-compensate
the dispersion of the microscope objective, and a knife edge was placed between the prisms to
remove spectral components above 1400 nm (Figure S12 in the Supplement), which resulted

pulses, which are compressed to 100 fs in a multi-plate compressor (MPC). These
pulses are coupled into an anti-resonant hollow-core fiber held in a pair of gas cells
filled with Ar. The light that exits the fiber goes through a spectral filter (SF) to
select the desired lobe. The filtered light then goes through a dispersive delay line to
pre-compensate the dispersion of the microscope, and is aligned into the microscope.
It is reflected off scanning mirrors and expanded, then collimated and sent through a
dichroic beam splitter (DBS1) to the objective lens and onto the sample. Third-harmonic
and three-photon fluorescence are reflected back through the objective lens and reflected
of DBS1. DBS2, a second dichroic beamsplitter, spearates the third harmonic from
the three-photon fluorescence, and each is sent to a photomultiplier tube (PMT). (b)

in a typical post-objective energy of 240 nJ. With an excitation NA of 0.75, the microscope
maintains sub-cellular resolution across a field-of-view of 430 x 430 µm2 (Figure S12(c-e) in the

Results
With increasing Ar pressure, the output spectrum broadens (Figure 2), as one would expect
theoretically [31]. Numerical simulations of this process with our experimental parameters are
presented in the Supplemental Document. We will describe the generation and characterization

of the pulses at 1300 nm in some detail. The spectrum broadens with increasing pressure until
there is a lobe centered at 1300 nm.
The spectral shape and temporal profile of this lobe were optimized by varying the input-pulse
duration between 60 and 100 fs, with the best result obtained with 100-fs input pulses. Using a
long-pass filter, 960 nJ were isolated at wavelengths longer than 1240 nm (Figure 3(a)). The
pulse in this spectral lobe, whose temporal profile is shown in Figure 3(b), was found to have a
full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) duration of around 50 fs, with a tail extending out to about
200 fs. Although the peak power is greater than 10 MW, we removed the tail with grating-pair
dispersion compensation, as shown in Figure 3(c). The FROG reconstructions for both the
chirped and dechirped pulses have errors below 0.5%. The agreement of the measured and
reconstructed spectra (Figure 3(a)) further supports the FROG reconstruction. The light in this
spectral interval has a polarization extinction ratio of 13 dB.
For each wavelength of interest, the Ar pressure was varied, but the input pulse duration
was fixed at 100 fs. The results are summarized in Figure 4, and presented in greater detail
in the Supplement. These results demonstrate that the source can provide multi-megawatt
pulses throughout the octave spanning from 850 nm to 1700 nm, even without any dispersion
compensation. The 100-fs pulses were used because they yield good performance at 1300 nm.
By tailoring the duration of the pulses from the MPC as well as the gas pressure to produce the
wavelength of interest, it should be possible to improve on the results presented here.
We performed both structural and functional three-photon in vivo imaging of neurons in
transgenic GCaMP6s mice (CamKII-tTA/tetO-GCaMP6s). The animal procedures followed
those described in Ref. [39]. Briefly, we performed a craniotomy and placed a glass window to
provide optical access to the brain (see Section 7 of the Supplement for more details). As Figure

S12(a) in the Supplement shows, pulses of 60 fs duration can be obtained after the objective.
The maximum pulse energy after the objective was 240 nJ, for an average power of 48 mW. We
performed structural imaging of the entire cortical column and down to the external capsule,
which extended from approximately 950 µm to 1100 µm depth (Figure 5(a)-(c)). We consistently
detected spontaneous neuronal activity more than 800 µm below the dura with sufficiently high
numbers of photons/neuron/second for high-fidelity calcium transient recording [39,40] (Figure
5(d)-(e), Figure S13 in the Supplement). For functional imaging of the deepest active neurons
we detected, at 930 µm below the dura, only about 50% of the available laser power was used,
which provides ample margin for use with microscopes with lower transmission at 1300 nm.
To verify that the 1300-nm source provides similar excitation efficiency to existing sources for
three-photon microscopy, we compare our calcium imaging results to those acquired with a NOPA
in [39]. The imaging experiments reported here were performed with approximately the same
parameters that affect the signal (i.e., pulse duration, microscope collection efficiency, fluorophore
concentration, three-photon action cross section, excitation wavelength, and excitation NA).
Wang et al. reported that a pulse energy of 1.86 ± 0.27 nJ at the focus is required to detect
0.1 emission photon per excitation pulse. Assuming an effective attenuation length of 300 µm,
our imaging results indicate that a pulse energy of 2.05 ± 0.26 nJ at the focus is required to
achieve the same signal strength with the new source. The small difference could be due to
variations in tissue properties such as scattering lengths and wavefront aberration. Therefore,
within the uncertainties introduced by biological sample variations, the new source achieves the
same excitation efficiency as the NOPA for three-photon microscopy.

assumes a deconvolution factor of 1.4.

Discussion
The conversion efficiency from 1030 nm to 1300 nm within the ARHCF is almost 14% with
respect to the coupled pulse energy. In these proof-of-concept experiments, the coupling efficiency
into the ARHCF was only 70%, and the MPC efficiency was only 56%. As a result, the total
efficiency of the system from the CPA output pulse to the wavelength-converted output was only
about 5%. The low efficiency of the MPC is primarily due to the use of a grating pair for the
dispersive delay. The use of chirped mirrors rather than a grating pair should improve the MPC
efficiency to 90% or higher. Some improvement in the coupling into the ARHCF can also be
expected. With these changes, it should be quite possible to reach an overall efficiency of 10%.
Thus, a CPA that supplies 10-µJ pulses should be sufficient to achieve the performance described
in Figure 4. For use in high-speed imaging it will be important to increase the repetition rate of the
source into the several-megahertz range, which should be possible. Short-pulse amplifiers with
multi-megahertz repetition rates and above 20 W average power have been demonstrated [41,42],
and some of the thermal effects that can limit Raman-based wavelength conversion [43] will
not occur in atomic gases. Overall, the high efficiency of our approach will ultimately reduce
cost and enhance robustness by allowing the use of a lower power pump laser, and enable a
high repetition-rate (>5 MHz) and high pulse-energy (>1 µJ) source without increasing pump
power beyond that of the existing NOPAs. Because optimum imaging requires matching the
pulse energy and repetition rate with the imaging depth [44], such a source will deliver optimum
imaging performance over a large range of depths by simply adjusting the repetition rate of
the pump or attenuating the pulse energy. Currently, multiple NOPAs are required to achieve
optimum conditions for imaging at depths between 600 µm and 1000 µm in a mouse brain,

for example. Finally, this approach will create new opportunities to implement novel imaging
techniques such as adaptive excitation for deep and fast imaging [45].
Extension of this approach to a broader range of wavelengths would be difficult in the ARHCF
used here because, as Figure 1(c) shows, this fiber has high losses at wavelengths longer than
1700 nm and shorter than 800 nm due to resonances. Energy scaling without broader wavelength
tunability should be possible with the ARHCF used here by simply reducing the gas pressure.
The use of a capillary rather than an ARHCF may allow broader spectral tunability, but this would
require either higher pump pulse energy or higher gas pressure than those used here, because the
mode-field area in any currently-existing capillary is larger than that of our ARHCF. On the other
hand, the use of a capillary will also enable energy scaling for the same reason.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated a wavelength-tunable source of 100-fs pulses with peak powers well over
1 MW between 850 and 1700 nm based on self-phase modulation in Ar-filled fiber. In addition to
the new wavelengths that are generated, the amplifier and compressor provide 100-MW pulses at
1030 nm. Our approach provides a new route to the generation of energetic sub-100-fs pulses
that are tunable across the most-important wavelength windows for deep-tissue multiphoton
microscopy. Structural and functional three-photon fluorescence images of tissue deep in mouse
brain illustrate the effectiveness of the source.

Efficient, broadly-tunable source of
megawatt pulses for multiphoton
microscopy based on self-phase
modulation in argon-filled hollow-core
fiber: supplemental document
1. INTRODUCTION
In this supplement, we first show the simulation results that motivated this work, then discuss
temporal and spectral data for the pulses we measured at the various wavelengths, and present a
peak-power test we conducted for the pulse generated at 1300 nm. We also show the character-
ization of the microscope, and neuronal activity data for neurons 824 µm below the dura for a
different mouse from the one described in the main text. Finally, the methods for mouse surgeries
are summarized.
2. SIMULATIONS
Although [1] shows simulation results that demonstrate that SESS in atomic gas is a possible
route to 1300 nm, we wanted to run simulations for our exact system: a compressed pulse
undergoing SESS in argon gas, in the specific anti-resonant fiber used in the experiments. We
used a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm to simulate the propagation of our experimental
100-fs pulse (as reconstructed by FROG) by solving the unidirectional pulse propagation equation
with dispersion, Kerr nonlinearity, and self-steepening. Figure S1 shows the trend, suggesting
that this approach can be used to yield light at 1300 nm.

3. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS AT WAVELENGTHS OTHER THAN 1300 nm
A. 850 nm
To generate a useful, high-power lobe at 850 nm, the fiber was filled with 14 bar of Ar. The output
spectrum is shown on log scale in Figure S2. Clearly, there is a lobe at 850 nm, as shown in the
shaded region. We isolate this lobe with a pair of spectral filters as shown in Figure S2, and show
the spectrum in linear scale in Figure S3(a), showing that the peak of the spectrum is at 850 nm.
The light in this spectral band had an energy of 300 nJ (assuming that the output lens has an
efficiency of 80% at this wavelength, since it is coated to transmit longer wavelengths), and a
polarization extinction ratio (PER) of 11.5 dB.
The temporal profile, as reconstructed by frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) is shown
in Figure S3(b). The pulse has a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 49 fs and the FROG error
was below 1%. It should be noted that this spectrum has the bandwidth for a 24-fs pulse, which
our FROG was not able to reconstruct, due to the bandwidth limitations of FROG resulting from
the finite phase-matching bandwidth of its crystal. The spectrum that the FROG did reconstruct
has the bandwidth for 32-fs pulses, which is only slightly shorter than the pulse the FROG
reconstructed. We hope to characterize this pulse more precisely in the future. In a worst-case
scenario, the energy in the parts of the spectrum that were not reconstructed do not contribute
at all to the peak power. In this case, we estimate that 60% of the energy, or 180 nJ, are in the
49-fs pulse, making a peak power of around 3 MW. However, this worst-case scenario is highly
unlikely, since the lobe is a clean SPM-lobe, and the part of the spectrum that was successfully

reconstructed was near its transform-limit. As such, it is likelier that the entire lobe was closer to
its transform limit of 24 fs. If it was roughly 30 fs long, which is probably the best-case scenario
(due to the slight phase on the spectrum we did reconstruct), the peak power would be 10 MW.

B. 1160 nm
The fiber was filled with 15 bar of Ar, and coupled the same MPC pulse through it. The full
spectrum at the fiber output is shown in Figure S4. We isolated part of the spectrum with a
long-pass filter at 1106 nm (the left vertical line in Figure S4. This part of the spectrum, which
is represented by the entire shaded region in Figure S4, had an energy of 1.42 µJ and PER of
11 dB. To study the lobe centered at 1160 nm, we inserted another long-pass filter at 1217 nm
(the right vertical line in Figure S4) and found that the part of the pulse in this spectral region,
which is represented by the darkly shaded region in Figure S4), had a total energy of 750 nJ. This
means that the spectral lobe centered at 1160 nm (in the lightly shaded region in Figure S4) had
an energy of 670 nJ.
Fig. S4. The full spectrum at the output of the anti-resonant fiber pressurized with 15 bar of
Ar. Shaded region: the interval isolated with a long-pass filter at 1106 nm. The darkly shaded
region represents the part of the spectrum that does not interest us; the lightly shaded region is
the lobe centered at 1160 nm.
Figure S5 depicts both spectral intervals on linear scale. The spectrum in blue corresponds to
the full, 1.42 µJ-spectral interval beyond 1106 nm. The spectrum in red corresponds to the part of
the spectrum beyond 1217 nm, which contains 750 nJ and does not interest us. As such, we claim
1420 nJ - 750 nJ = 670 nJ in the lobe centered at 1160 nm.
Although we did not isolate the lobe at 1160 nm for spectral reconstruction due to a lack of a
short-pass filter at 1217 nm, this did not end up mattering, since as mentioned above, the FROG
itself can serve as a spectral filter. Here we were able to reconstruct the entire lobe that interested
us, as in Figure S6. Panel (a) depicts the full spectrum, which is the same as the blue line in Figure
S5. The red line in the same panel represents the spectrum as reconstructed by FROG, showing
that FROG indeed acts as an effective spectral filter. The reconstructed pulse is shown in S6(b).
This measured pulse has a FWHM of 80 fs. The nominal transform-limited duration of this pulse
is 40 fs. We did not attempt to dechirp it.
We note that the FROG reconstruction that yielded a FWHM of 80 fs assumes some energy in
the part of the spectrum that is filtered out before we measured the energy of 670 nJ; Figure S6(a)
shows a tail in the reconstructed spectrum going all the way to 1400 nm. However, this energy is
not in the 670-nJ lobe centered at 1160 nm, but rather in the 750-nJ part of the spectrum beyond
1217 nm. As such, we numerically inserted a short-pass filter at 1217 nm to see the temporal
profile of the 670-nJ lobe that interests us. This shortens the FWHM of the reconstructed pulse to
60 fs, as shown in Figure 4 of the main text, and in Figure S7 here.

C. 1500 nm
We pressurized the fiber with 22 bar of Ar, and coupled the same MPC pulse through it. The
full spectrum at the fiber output is shown in Figure S8. We isolated part of the spectrum with
a long-pass filter at 1460 nm (the shaded region in Figure S8. This part of the spectrum had an
energy of 500 nJ and PER of 13 dB.

Figure S9(a) depicts the selected spectral interval in linear scale, and Figure S9(b) shows the
FROG reconstruction of the temporal profile of the pulse. The agreement between the measured
and retrieved FROG traces was within 1% FROG error, and the reconstructed spectrum matched
the measured spectrum well. The retrieved pulse has a duration of 62 fs, and a nominal transform-
limited duration of 40 fs. We did not attempt to dechirp the pulse further.

D. 1700 nm
We pressurized the fiber with 32 bar of Ar. The full spectrum at the fiber output is shown in
Figure S10. We isolated part of the spectrum with a long-pass filter at 1668 nm (the shaded region
in Figure S10. The spectrometer does not reliably measure wavelengths far beyond 1700 nm, so
we used a second spectrometer for the filtered lobe. This filtered lobe is depicted together with
the corresponding autocorrelation trace in Figure S11 (we measured an autocorrelation because
our FROG device cannot measure these wavelengths). This part of the spectrum had an energy of
220 nJ and PER of 11 dB. Assuming a Gaussian fit, the pulse should have a FWHM of around
90 fs. The transform-limited pulse has a FWHM of roughly 70 fs.

4. PEAK POWER TEST
To provide further evidence that the pulse we generated at a carrier wavelength of 1300 nm
is indeed a coherent pulse with high peak power, 60 nJ were split off from the chirped pulse
and focused onto a 100-µm-thick BBO crystal for second harmonic generation (SHG). The SHG
conversion efficiency was compared with the theoretical value as follows.
If one assumes no pump depletion, no diffraction, and perfect phase matching for the entire
spectrum, the energy efficiency of the SHG process will be
η = ω2
ϵ0c3
 d2
n3
 L2
Aeff
 R (P(t))2dt
R (P(t))dt
(S1)
Where ω is the central fundamental angular frequency, ϵ0 is the permittivity of vacuum; c is
the speed of light, d is the element of the χ(2) tensor relevant to this process; n is the index of
refraction of the crystal; L is the length of the crystal, 100 µm in our case; Aeff is the effective area
of the focused beam–approximately 50 µm2; and P(t) is the pulse power as a function of time.
We used a value of 1.75 pm/V for d[2], and the ratio of integrals evaluates to 0.65 for our
reconstructed pulse, after taking into account the dispersion of the beamsplitter. For these
values, Equation S1 predicts a SHG efficiency of roughly 50%, whereas we achieved a conversion
efficiency of 25%. This puts a lower bound on the peak power of the chirped pulse as 70% of
the roughly 15 MW calculated by the FROG reconstruction. However, we believe that the peak
power is higher, and that the discrepancy between theory and experiment can be easily explained
by the fact that, as mentioned above, Equation S1 neglects pump depletion, diffraction (which is
significant over the length of the crystal, since the beam is tightly focused), and the finitude of the
phase-matching bandwidth.

7. METHODS FOR MOUSE SURGERIES
A. Animals
Transgenic mice (CamKII-tTA/tetO-GCaMP6s, n = 2, 2-8 months old, male) were used for all
three-photon imaging experiments. Mice were housed in groups of 1–5 on a 12-h reverse light/
dark cycle before and after surgery. All animal experimentation and housing procedures were
conducted in accordance with Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
guidance.
11
B. Chronic Craniotomy
Prior to surgery, mice were given buprenorphine (intraperitoneally, 0.3 mg per kg of body weight)
and dexamethasone (subcutaneously, 5 mg per kg of body weight). Animals were anesthetized
with isoflurane (2 liters per minute of oxygen with 2-5% isoflurane for induction, 1 liter of oxygen
per minute with 1-3% isoflurane during the surgery to maintain a constant breathing frequency).
Body temperature was kept at 37.5 °C during the surgery with a standard small-animal heating
pad (Kent Scientific). Eye ointment (Puralube veterinary ophthalmic ointment) was applied to
protect the eyes during surgery. Animals were head-fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf
Instruments). A 4-mm-diameter craniotomy was made over the right V1 (AP-2.7, ML-2.4 from
bregma) with dura left intact. A glass window made of a circular 4-mm-diameter coverslip (4
mm Potomac, 170 µm) glued to a circular glass ring with an inner diameter of 3.5 mm and outer
diameter of 5.5 mm (3.5x5.5 mm Potomac, 170 µm) was placed in the craniotomy, embedding
the circular glass inside and keeping the glass ring on the skull around the craniotomy. The
cranial window was sealed with cyanoacrylate superglue (Super Glue, ethyl cyanoacrylate) and
with dental cement (C&B Matabond). A custom-made titanium head-post was then attached to
the skull with dental cement (C&B Matabond). Ketoprofen (subcutaneously, 0.15 mg per kg of
body weight) was administered immediately after surgery and then once daily for the following
two consecutive days. Imaging was performed either on the same day of surgery, or at least 3
weeks after surgery when the tissue inflammation disappears, and mice were habituated to head
fixation.
