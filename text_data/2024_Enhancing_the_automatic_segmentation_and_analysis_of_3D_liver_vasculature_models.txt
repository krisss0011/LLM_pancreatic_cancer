Abstract. Surgical assessment of liver cancer patients requires identi-
fication of the vessel trees from medical images. Specifically, the venous
trees - the portal (perfusing) and the hepatic (draining) trees are impor-
tant for understanding the liver anatomy and disease state, and perform
surgery planning. This research aims to improve the 3D segmentation,
skeletonization, and subsequent analysis of vessel trees, by creating an
automatic pipeline based on deep learning and image processing tech-
niques.
The first part of this work explores the impact of differentiable skele-
tonization methods such as ClDice and morphological skeletonization
loss, on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To this aim,
it studies how to improve vessel tree connectivity.
The second part of this study converts a single class vessel segmentation
into multi-class ones, separating the two venous trees. It builds on the
previous two-class vessel segmentation model, which vessel tree outputs
might be entangled, and on connected components and skeleton analyses
of the trees.
After providing sub-labeling of the specific anatomical branches of each
venous tree, these algorithms also enable a morphometric analysis of the
vessel trees by extracting various geometrical markers.
In conclusion, we propose a method that successfully improves current
skeletonization methods, for extensive vascular trees that contain vessels
of different calibers. The separation algorithm creates a clean multi-class
segmentation of the vessels, validated by surgeons to provide low error. A
new, publicly shared high-quality liver vessel dataset of 77 cases is thus
created. Finally a method to annotate vessel trees according to anatomy
is provided, enabling a unique liver vessel morphometry analysis.

Introduction
Having accurate 3D geometrical models of liver vessels is an important step
to plan surgical liver resection [1], the only curative treatment of liver cancer,

Machta et al.
which continues to be a growing healthcare problem worldwide [2]. Such models
also allow to study the morphometry of different vascular trees in healthy or
diseased livers. To obtain these models, achieving reliable 3D segmentation is
a crucial step. However, deep-learning (DL) based vessel segmentation suffers
from drawbacks such as disconnections or label mix-ups that have been studied
with graph-based approaches [3], persistent-homology approaches [4], and vessel
contrast filters [5] approaches featuring multiple decoders [6].
The first part of this research builds on the study of skeleton-based topolog-
ical loss functions. These functions introduced as ClDice by [7], offer a way to
improve vessel continuity in the segmented volume. The Cl-Dice method lever-
ages a differentiable algorithm to soft-skeletonize a tubular structure in order
to supervise the training with this skeleton’s topological information. MS Loss
[8] presents the Soft-Persistent-Skeletonization. It is also a differentiable method
of skeletonization that preserves connectivity. However these two methods may
yield to sub-optimal results, featuring many disconnections and uneven thick-
ness of the centerline. The reasons are the segmentation’s low voxel resolution
(512x512x 512 voxels compared to the kernel of the morphological operation)
and the irregular tree diameters. Alternative methods utilize gradient based op-
timisation [9] or the Unet to obtain the skeletonization in 2D [10]. In this paper,
we investigate which skeletonization method is best for liver vessel trees, and
whether an improved vessel skeleton can improve the results of 3D vessel seg-
mentation.
A major limitation in DL liver vessel segmentation is the lack of public, an-
notated with high-quality, and large datasets, which on top distinguish between
the portal and hepatic trees. Hence, we also evaluate the impact of increasing
the size of the dataset on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To
that end, we create a tool that can alleviate the annotation burden of vessel
volumes. It automatically converts a single-class annotation of the vessels into
a multi-class version separating the portal and hepatic trees. It uses heuristics
to assign conflicted parts of the voxel skeleton as opposed to the probabilistic
model by [11] used on meshes. This algorithm is run on an in-house-annotated
subset of the public LiTS [12] dataset, to obtain new pairs of CT scan and vessel
annotations featuring the portal and hepatic trees alongside the already available
liver and tumor segmentations. This new dataset is published with this paper.
The final part of the pipeline leverages the segmentation obtained above to
provide automatic analysis, relevant for pathophysiological and surgical appli-
cations [15]. We propose a novel method to further label individual branches,
building on an improved automatic segmentation of the different clinical seg-
ments of the liver volume as defined by the surgical Couinaud system [16]. This
enables a statistical analysis of the branches and patterns of both venous trees,
that provides morphometric information valuable not only for a general under-
standing of vascularized organs but also for disease staging and liver regeneration
understanding.

Contributions. In this paper we evaluate the impact of an alternative differ-
entiable skeletonization method on the performance of the ClDice loss in a 3D
setting for liver vessel segmentation, and provide a tool to automatically separate
the different vessel trees of vascularized organs, applied and tested on the liver
vessel trees in this research. We publicly release the dataset obtained from these
experiments after validation from surgeons. Finally, to the best of our knowledge,
we also provide a method to automatically and anatomically further label the
different tree branches down to the bifurcation level, along with a morphometric
analysis of these labeled liver portal and hepatic trees, performed on the largest
public liver vessel dataset to date.

Methods
2.1
Deep learning techniques to improve vessel tree skeletonization
and segmentation
Skeleton based losses and differentiable skeletonization methods. Build-
ing on the works of Nguyen et al. [10], an nnunet [18] was pretrained to predict
the liver vessel centerlines as shown on the right in Fig.1. The ground truth
(GT) leveraged for the training of the network is the centerline of the different
liver vessels obtained with Lee’s [17] skeletonization method implemented in the
Scikit-image library. This skeletonization neural network is then deployed on the
softmax outputs of the vessel segmentation model before being leveraged for the
computation of the ClDice loss. (Fig.1)

Model properties, hardware and datasets. The different experiments (1)
are performed using the nnUNet framework [18], with a modified loss incorpo-
rating ClDice in addition to the default dice and cross entropy losses. Training
processes take 14 to 20 hours for 500 epochs per fold for 5 folds. The multi-class
liver vessel dataset, encompassing both portal and hepatic trees, originates from
the public IRCAD dataset, which consists of 20 CT volumes [19], split into 16/4
training/validation volumes respectively. To palliate the small size dataset, we
4
Machta et al.
were able to add 53 cases segmented from the public LiTS [12] dataset (see the
next section 2.2). Overall, the model was trained on 69 cases and validated on
the same set of 4 volumes from IRCAD for all the folds .
2.2
Algorithm to separate portal and hepatic venous trees
We propose an algorithm that, from a single class venous vessel segmentation,
automatically distinguishes between the portal and hepatic vessel trees. During
the whole process described in Fig.2, the original segmentation remains intact,
where only the branches belonging to their respective trees are labeled accord-
ingly. Numbers in italic refer to steps in Fig.2, that are described below.
We begin by "pasting" an inferred dual labeled segmentation, thanks to the
model trained on IRCAD in section 2.1, on the original single-label one from our
inhouse annotation of LiTS vessels (2). We do this without compromising the
original segmentation. Due to a general phenomenon of under segmentation by
the model, we dilate the inferred segmentation.
The uncertain parts that were not covered by the inference are treated next
(3-5). Our course of action is to isolate these regions by finding the different
connected components (CC). They are then assigned to the closest main tree
(6). We also filter out certain classes that are farther than both trees by a fixed
distance or too small (<50 voxels), to avoid floating patches in the segmentation.
If a conflict class is in contact with both portal and hepatic trees, we proceed
to skeletonize the structure. The skeleton is turned into branches according to
bifurcations, by the skan package [13]. Once we have separated and labeled the
branches, we transform them into vectors by creating a Bersenham line between
the first and last point of the branch (7-8).
We iterate through all the branches starting by the closest ones to the portal
tree input(s) and the hepatic tree input(s). We determine whether it is connected
if the angle between the branches is inferior to 60° [14] (9).
This process of CCs and skeleton analysis is re-iterated until the disappear-
ance of conflicted classes(10-12). If there is no progress, the algorithm stops.
2.3
Tree automatic anatomical labeling and morphological analysis
We first extract the 1-pixel wide centerline of the tree with Lee’s [17] skele-
tonization method. The rest of the analysis is completed with the libraries Sknw
(https://github.com/Image-Py/sknw) and NetworkX, following a method by De-
crooq et al. [20].
Radius and Length are obtained by further exploring the networkX graph
obtained from the skeleton. Since the original volumes are voxel based, graphs
also have integer coordinates. But taking into account the voxel dimensions (or
the sampling of the CT Scans) leads to an accurate metric representation of
the tree: the length and radii of each branch are computed after a simple graph
search. Here, we employ a Breadth first search after automatically finding the
root of the two trees.

Vascular tree roots The liver segmentation enables the detection of the
roots as they are the farthest tree endpoints from the liver volume: the roots are
outside the liver.
Branching angles properties Due to noise created by the skeletonization
and sknw library, this process is not trivial as it can create extremely short paths
which are not relevant, or loops which are unrealistic. But they can be fused to
obtain an oriented graph, starting from the real anatomical root of the tree. We
can now analyze the morphometry of the trees.
Automatic labeling according to anatomical terminology In order
to visualize and analyze the morphometric data, we need a method to label
and locate each branch. There exist many indexing methods such as Strahler’s
order [21]. Here, we settled on the anatomical nomenclature commonly referred
to by liver surgeons and clinicians. This requires the ability to pinpoint, for
example for the portal vein, the main portal vein, right branch, left branch, the
different anterior or posterior segments. This is performed by heuristics relying
on branch relations and spatial position. But we also leverage the fact that
since liver vessels enable the classification of the liver volume into anatomical
segments called the Couinaud segments. The prediction of these segments by a
plain nnUNet model trained on the dataset provided by Tian et al. [16], is added
to help in anatomically distinguishing between branches. To pinpoint the branch
root of the portal tree for example, we keep fusing paths until the descendants
of the main tree are in separate parts of the liver, right and left (Fig. 4c).

Results
3.1
DL techniques for tree skeletonization and segmentation
Both models’(skeletonization and segmentation) results are evaluated with the
Dice, ClDice, Surface Dice [22] and Hausdorff distance metrics, after taking into
account the CT sampling. The tolerable threshold for the surface Dice is fixed at
2mm. The skeletonization neural network achieves a score of 98% for SurfaceDice
(see Table 1).
When using it in the segmentation neural network’s ClDice module, there is
an improvement from the baseline. However it is not that different from using
the base skeletonization functions.
3.2
Separation algorithm to distinguish the portal and hepatic trees
We applied the automatic separation algorithm on a 62-case dataset that was
previously annotated in house with the help of liver surgeons, and an initial
automatic segmentation. These 62 cases are a subset of the LiTS dataset. The
surgeons have classified 35 segmentations as flawless and 18 as containing a small
mixup between the two trees. The 9 remaining presented larger errors due to
the heavy interconnections of the original segmentation.
After this validation, the minor issues were quickly fixed, showcasing the re-
duced annotation burden, and lead to 53 final segmentation volumes in total.
Note that some of the initial segmentations we ran the algorithm on, had anno-
tations that featured the main branches only. Available cases are now 20 from
IRCAD annotations with both trees, and 53 from the annotated and separated
LiTS annotation. This new dataset is called LIRCAD. Training on LIRCAD im-
proves all of our previous benchmarks across all metrics by 2 to 3 percentage
points and reduces Hausdorff distance (Table 2).
3.3
Automatic vessel anatomical labeling & morphological analysis
We now analyze the LIRCAD dataset of 77 cases, by extracting the following
properties (Fig.5), showing differences between right and left livers: tree_ID
(ID in the dataset), tree_label (portal or hepatic), path_label (path_ID in

Discussion and Conclusion
Discussion The results show that the differentiable skeletonization performance
was lackluster compared to the widely used but non-differentiable version [17].
The skeletonization neural network achieves much better centerline representa-
tions than the morphological operations as shown in Table 1 and Fig.3. Moreover,
we investigated whether skeleton quality might improve ClDice results. Adding
a neural network inference instead of a skeletonization algorithm consisting of
a series of morphological operations does double the training time (from 80s to
8
Machta et al.
160s per epoch) but it provides a more accurate and homogeneous skeleton for
the ClDice computation. However, the overall segmentation performance does
not improve as shown in Table 2. This result holds even when training for a
larger number of epochs. The pretrained aspect of this neural network can make
it multipurpose and is its biggest advantage. Since its input is a segmentation
volume, it can theoretically be a general skeletonization algorithm for any tubu-
lar structure (such as other organs’ vessels or tree roots for example).

The label separation algorithm works well in general, but has its corner cases:
mainly highly dense and interconnected areas that should not be, due to a lack-
luster initial 1-label segmentation and CT Scan resolution, showcased in 12 in
Fig.2. Since it occurs mostly in the distal parts of the tree, its impact for clinical
application is limited. We also note that Lee skeletonization and skan are not per-
fect and can lead to undesirable results. They are the backbone of the algorithm
and can be further optimised. However, the dataset this labelling algorithm cre-
ates, is the source of the biggest improvement of our vessel segmentation models,
and opens the door for our morphological study (Fig.5).
The automatic anatomical branch labeling and subsequently, the morphom-
etry extraction, also depend on the performance of the skeletonization and sknw
library which can lead to the creation of loops or big lumps of voxels. The angles
obtained are limited by the fact that we are in a voxel environment. But we
hope that these results can aid in tree modeling and extract viable biomarkers
for surgeons and scientists.
Conclusions In this paper we showcase a way to train a differentiable and
precise skeletonization algorithm, a deep dive of ClDice on liver vessels which
feature a 3D structure, with an extensive network of vessels that have vastly
different radii. We also present a method to obtain multi-label segmentations.
This makes the annotation burden lighter as we do not need to pay attention to
which tree a vessel tree belongs to, and automatically label the trees after.
Finally we also introduce a novel method to automatically label the main
clinically relevant branches for surgeons during their assessment, such as the
main branches and their immediate daughter branches. We also propose a label-
ing of the smaller branches according to their generation or Couinaud region.
Finally, we extract the first computational morphometric study on human liver
vessels as far as we are aware.
