Summary 
Background Artificial intelligence may assist healthcare systems in meeting increasing demand 
for pathology services while maintaining diagnostic quality and reducing turnaround time and 
costs. We aimed to investigate the performance of an institutionally developed system for prostate 
cancer detection, grading, and workflow optimization and to contrast this with commercial 
alternatives. 
Methods From August 2021 to March 2023, we scanned 21,396 slides from 1,147 patients with 
positive biopsies. We developed models for cancer detection, grading, and screening of equivocal 
cases for immunohistochemical (IHC, triple stain) ordering. We compared a task-specific models 
trained using the PANDA dataset of prostate cancer biopsies with one built using features 
extracted by the general-purpose histology foundation model, UNI and compare their 
performance in an unfiltered prospectively collected dataset that reflects our patient population 
(1737 slides, 95 patients). We also evaluated the contributions of a bespoke model designed to 
improve sensitivity in detecting small cancer foci and scoring of broader patterns observed at 
lower resolution. 
Findings We found high concordance between the developed systems and pathologist reference 
in detection (area under curve 98.5, sensitivity 95.0, and specificity 97.8), ISUP grading (quadratic 
Cohen's kappa 0.869), grade group 3 or higher (area under curve 97.5, sensitivity 94.9, specificity 
96.6) and comparable to published data from commercial systems. Screening could reduce 
immunohistochemical ordering for equivocal cases by 44.5% with an overall error rate of 1.8% 
(1.4% false positive rate and 0.4% false negative rate). No statistically significant differences were 
observed when comparing performance of task-specific and foundation models for cancer 
detection, although the task-specific model was more than 50 times smaller. Bespoke model 
performance was superior to alternatives in all tasks. 
Interpretation Institutions like academic medical centers that have high scanning volumes and 
report abstraction capabilities can develop highly accurate computational pathology models for 
internal use. These models have the potential to aid in quality control role and to improve resource 
allocation and workflow in the pathology lab to help meet future challenges in prostate cancer 
diagnosis.

Introduction 
Prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed malignancy in men worldwide, with over 1 million 
new cases diagnosed per year[1]. While biomarkers and advanced imaging such as Prostate-
Specific Antigen (PSA) and multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) have aided 
in the detection and risk stratification of prostate cancer, management of this disease process 
ultimately relies on accurate diagnosis from biopsied tissues. With an aging population worldwide, 
the volume of prostate biopsy specimens requiring interpretation is expected to increase 
dramatically [2, 3]. Meeting this demand will increase workload on pathologists who are also 
facing workforce challenges [4]. Artificial intelligence has been suggested as a solution to meet 
demand while maintaining or improving quality through efficiency gains or upskilling general 
pathologists [5, 6]. Notably, subspecialists typically perform better than general pathologists in 
prostate cancer detection and grading [7-9], with general pathologists achieving agreement in 
less than 60% of cases while 90% of disagreements leading to upgrades [13]. AI tools could help 
bridge this performance gap by where whole-slide imaging (WSI) is used, and reduce costs and 
delays associated with consultation and immunohistochemical analysis. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is an important part of the pathology workflow in prostate cancer 
with significant implications for costs and delays. IHC triple stain, which comprises 
AMACR(P504S), p63, and high molecular weight cytokeratin, is mainly ordered to distinguish 
invasive carcinoma from high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and other benign mimickers 
following initial review of the H&E slides. This additional tissue processing introduces delays, and 
additional work to review the IHC slides. The cost of IHC testing can be substantial for payers and 
the health care system, with a Medicare price of $172.76 and with approximately 1 million biopsies 
performed annually in the United States [10, 11]. One study found that community pathologists 
are more than twice as likely than academic pathologists to order IHC (26% vs. 11%) [12], adding 
costs and delays to patients diagnosed in community-based practices. Few studies have analyzed 
the impact of AI tools on IHC use and impact to costs and delays in prostate cancer [13]. 
Multiple commercial tools intended for clinical use have been developed for prostate cancer to 
aid detection and grading of biopsies [14, 15]. Performance of the FDA-approved Paige prostate 
cancer detection system has been described in several studies [5, 16, 17]. The Paige system was 
developed with a weakly-supervised method that learns from slide-level labels to avoid the need 
for image annotation. IBEX Galen Prostate is a CE-IVD approved tool for prostate cancer 
detection and grading that was developed using 1.3M annotations of high-power fields to train 
field-level classifiers [6]. The performance metrics for standalone detection and grading performed 
by these tools are presented in Tables 1-2. While these tools can be used in a standalone second 
read capacity for quality control, they are intended to aid in primary diagnosis, and so studies also 
report performance with interactive use, including improvements in tool-assisted read time. These 
studies emphasize external validation since commercial tools will encounter significant 
preanalytical variability in deployment. 
Prostate cancer detection and grading of biopsies has been a popular research topic. Two papers 
published in 2020 report similar performance in detection and grading, both using image 
annotations to develop field-level classifiers and image segmentation models (see Tables 1-2) 
[18, 19]. Data used in these studies supported the PANDA challenge that reported on the 
performance of models from academic competitors on a large, curated dataset [20]. Internal and 
external test data used in [18-20] include data from a population-based screening study [19] and 
were reviewed by multiple uropathologists to achieve accurate ground truth [18, 20]. Other models 
 
 
 
 
Page 3 of 12 
 
for prostate cancer detection and grading have been reported, developed and evaluated on 
PANDA and other data sources [21-25]. More recently, foundation models trained on datasets of 
hundreds of thousands or millions of WSI have demonstrated strong performance in many tasks 
including prostate cancer detection and grading [26, 27]. 
Data from challenges and academic studies are an invaluable community resource. The selection 
and exclusion of cases for practical reasons or to balance dataset characteristics is often 
necessary in building datasets but may distort expectations of model performance in clinical use. 
Adjusting the proportions of benign and malignant cases or grades can improve evaluation on 
less common patterns like high-grade cancers but can also increase the fraction of cases where 
models typically perform better in detection and grading. Exclusion based on discordant pathology 
reviews, imaging or tissue processing artifacts, or selecting for slides with higher cancer extent 
can also remove more challenging cases from evaluation that diminish sensitivity or produce false 
alarms that require attention. 
In this study we describe the development and validation of an institutional AI system for prostate 
cancer detection and grading and minimization of IHC use. This system was developed and 
validated using data collected at Northwestern Memorial Hospital over multiple years, including a 
prospectively collected validation dataset that represents our patient population (see Figure 1). 
We show that this model has comparable performance to published data on commercial systems 
and can reduce immunohistochemical ordering for equivocal cases by 44.5% with an error rate 
of 1.8%. We further compare foundation models to more efficient prostate-specific models, finding 
equivalent performance with significant cost savings, and demonstrate the utility of a bespoke 
model designed to improve prostate tasks.

Methods  
Datasets 
Data for model development and validation were generated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital 
(NMH) between August 2021 and May 2023 (IRB protocol 00213676). All slide scanning was 
performed using a Leica Systems Aperio GT 450 scanner with 40x objective magnification. In the 
period from August 2021 to April 2023 we scanned 23,833 slides from 1,278 patients with at least 
one positive core for model development purposes (see Figure 1a). To collect a representative 
sample of our patient population for validation, the criteria was changed to all slides from all 
prostate biopsies for the month of April 2023 for a total of 1,737 slides from 95 subjects. Patients 
were stratified into internal training, validation, and testing sets (See Figure S1). Prior to scanning, 
slides were wiped to remove any pen markings present on the coverslips. Pathology report data 
was abstracted from the Northwestern Medicine Electronic Data Warehouse (NM EDW) and 
normalized by the enterprise data warehouse team using a combination of database query and 
natural language processing to obtain primary and secondary Gleason patterns for each block 
and other diagnostic information. A workflow was developed to link scanned slides to the 
structured pathology and clinical data tables using a combination of barcode reading and optical 
character recognition with manual review of slide label images. This process is summarized in 
Figure S2. A summary of all slides, blocks, specimens, and subjects is presented in Table S1. 
For IHC model development, we utilized our entire prostate cancer cohort, excluding cases with 
IHC staining. We identified slides from blocks where reported cancer extent was less than 20% 
and with Gleason grades of 1 or 2 to identify the most difficult cases (this threshold was suggested 
by our senior genitourinary pathologist to discriminate between ordering for medicolegal reasons 
versus aiding in diagnosis). The remaining cohort was partitioned into training and validation sets 
at a 0.9:0.1 ratio, with excluded cases reserved for model testing. This strategy ensured 
evaluation on challenging cases that reflect real-world low-volume cancer patients typically 
requiring additional IHC testing. 
 
Histology encoders and prediction model architecture 
PANDA data was used to develop a task-specific encoder (TSE) for embedding high-power fields. 
The PANDA dataset comprises 12,625 fully annotated WSIs retrospectively collected from 
patients undergoing prostate biopsy due to suspected cancer, as summarized in Supplementary 
Table S2. We observed a significant difference in the accuracy of image annotations between the 
Radboud Medical Center and Karolinska institute datasets, with the annotations from Karolinska 
lacking spatial precision. We utilized only Radboud slides in our experiments, removing 312 of 
these slides due to missing annotations or the presence of tissue processing artifacts. 
An EfficientNetB0 convolutional network was trained to classify high-power fields using this data 
(Figure S3a). After applying ICC correction (Figure S4), the data was split at the slide level into 
80% for training and 20% for in-training validation. A total of 1.41 million 256x256 pixel high-power 
fields were extracted at 20X objective magnification. Field-level annotations were derived from 
the provided pixel mask annotations to calculate the proportions of carcinoma and stroma in each 
tile. Tiles containing at least 25% carcinoma were labeled as carcinoma, while tiles that were 
entirely benign were labeled as benign. Following training, the network was truncated by removing 
the last dense classification layers to create a task-specific encoder. The encoder was applied to 
the fields from the NMH cohort using a nonoverlapping mosaic tiling of tissue regions to generate 
 
 
 
 
Page 6 of 12 
 
an embedding for each tile. Encoded tiles from the NMH slides were aggregated by slide and then 
block to develop and validate detection and grading models. We also evaluate the general-
purpose UNI encoder as an alternative to the task-specific encoder trained with PANDA. UNI was 
not fine-tuned and was applied directly to the high-power fields from the NMH cohorts in the same 
manner as described above. Training details are provided in the supplementary materials, section 
1.1 and Figures S5 to S7. 
For block-level predictions we developed a model that captures both near-range and long-range 
interactions between fields in a memory-efficient manner. The Sparse Convolutional Transformer 
(SCT) model combines self-attention and convolution using a novel element-wise self-attention 
(ESA) mechanism that models both spatial and channel-wise relationships (Figure S6). Fields 
are aggregated into 3x3 neighborhoods and ESA is applied to each field, followed by a within-
neighborhood convolution. SCT models are composed of sequences of transformer blocks of that 
combine ESA and convolution operations with pooling, normalization, and multi-head self-
attention that produce a multi-scale representation that combines finer details with higher-order 
contextual information (Figure S7, Table S3). 
 
Prediction models for cancer detection and grading 
SCT models for carcinoma detection were trained to predict block-level labels for benign / 
carcinoma and SCT models for grading were trained to predict block-level ISUP grade and 
primary and secondary Gleason pattern. The grading model contains shared layers to learn 
Gleason pattern morphologies followed by independent dense layers for primary and secondary 
pattern prediction. Appendix 1.2 to 1.4 contains additional details of the models and baselines. 
We used the pROC R package to evaluate statistical significance of model AUC measurements 
using paired and unpaired DeLong tests [28]. McNemar’s test was also used to assess the 
significance of model sensitivities and specificities. The 95% confidence intervals for kappa 
statistics are also obtained for comparison. 
 
Dual model detection for equivocal slides 
For cancer detection in equivocal cases where IHC is typically ordered, we developed 
complementary SCT models: one highly sensitive model for ruling out the presence of carcinoma 
and one highly specific for ruling in carcinoma (Figure S3b). These models are combined to 
identify clear negative and positive blocks, and truly equivocal blocks where the models are not 
reliable and where IHC is required. 
 
 
Experimental Results 
Cancer detection performance 
Performance for SCT detection models on the NMH prospective validation set is shown in Figure 
2. SCT-UNI and SCT-TSE have comparable performance with no statistically significant 
differences in AUC, sensitivity, or specificity. False negative errors were primarily associated with 
blocks containing a small cancer extent, with the large majority occurring in blocks with <10% 
pathologist reported cancer extent (Figure 2b). A t-SNE visualization of the block-level

representations from SCT-TSE model shows clear clusters for benign and carcinoma blocks, and 
a transitional zone containing blocks with a mixture of benign and carcinoma labels (Figure 2c). 
Outliers may indicate errors in prediction or ground truth, but a pathology review of these outliers 
was not yet completed at the time of this publication. Disparities in detection performance were 
observed for self-identified Black patients who represent 7.3% of the NMH prospective dataset, 
although these disparities are not statistically significant when compared to self-identified White 
patients (Figure 2d). Performance was consistent across age groups with a small disparity for 
patients aged 50-61 (Figure 2e). This disparity was not statistically significant when comparing 
patients aged 50-61 to all other age groups. Benign / carcinoma classification AUC of the field-
level classifier was 96.8% when evaluated on PANDA (see examples Figure S8). We compared 
inference time, model size, and AUC for SCT detection model with UNI and TSE encoders in a 
Pareto plot (Figure S9). The task-specific encoder, with approximately 50 times fewer parameters, 
achieves 6.5 times faster inference while maintaining similar cancer detection performance (UNI: 
98.7 AUC, TSE: 98.5 AUC). 
We also compared the SCT detection model to Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning 
(ABMIL) and Vision Transformer (ViT) baselines (Figure S10) [29, 30]. For both encoders, SCT 
model performance is significantly better than baselines for TSE models. Visualizations of t-SNE 
embeddings for all models and encoders are presented in Figure S11 along with detailed tables 
of errors in Table S4. Our cancer detection model also shows performance comparable to leading 
commercial tools for prostate cancer diagnosis (Table 1).

Using a conservative threshold of 0.05 (1-0.95), the sensitive model screens 35.7% of benign 
cases with a false negative rate of 0.4%. A similar conservative threshold of 0.95 for the specific 
model screened 52.5% of carcinoma cases at a false positive rate of 1.4%.  The trade-offs 
between screening rates and errors are illustrated in Figure S12. Relaxation of these thresholds 
will screen a larger number of slides but with increased error rates. Figure 3 visualizes 
classification boundaries of the dual models at various thresholds plotted in 2D space by principal 
component analysis. 
 
Cancer grading performance 
Performance of the SCT grading model is presented in Figure 4. SCT-TSE and SCT-UNI have 
similar grading performance with significant differences observed in prediction of secondary 
Gleason pattern (Figure 4a). The AUC for ISUP grade prediction ranges from 97.3 (SCT-UNI) to 
98.1 (SCT-TSE) with corresponding kappa values of 0.869 (95% CI: 0.836 to 0.901) and 0.870 
(95% CI: 0.837 to 0.902) respectively. Prediction for the clinically important threshold of GG1-2 
versus GG3-5 has AUCs of 97.5 (SCT-TSE) and 94.8 (SCT-UNI). Larger differences between 
TSE and UNI were observed in kappa values for direct prediction of primary and secondary 
Gleason patterns (Figure 4b). SCT-TSE kappa values were generally higher than those of SCT-
UNI with 0.761 (95% CI: 0.675 to 0.847) versus 0.688 (95% CI: 0.592 to 0.784) for primary pattern 
and 0.413 (95% CI: 0.292 to 0.534) versus 0.317 (95% CI: 0.191 to 0.442) for secondary pattern.

Gleason patterns. In contrast, although some clusters for secondary patterns were present, they 
were less distinct and compact, suggesting due to the higher degree of subjectivity in secondary 
pattern prediction (Figure 4c). 
A grading performance comparison between SCT and baselines is shown in Figure S13. SCT 
models perform better than baselines in grading tasks with the exception of SCT-UNI for 
secondary pattern prediction. The SCT-TSE and SCT-UNI grading models attained AUCs of 
95.2% and 96.4% for primary patterns and 90.6% and 88.49% for secondary patterns, 
respectively, outperforming ViT (94.56%, 89.93%) and ABMIL (93.54%, 88.54%). Additionally, 
SCT-TSE and SCT-UNI grading models achieved higher quadratic Cohen's kappa scores of 
(0.761, 0.688) for primary Gleason pattern, showcasing better performance compared to ViT 
 
 
 
 
Page 10 of 12 
 
(0.676, 0.532) and ABMIL (0.695, 0.643) models. For the secondary Gleason pattern, SCT 
grading models also showed better performance, achieving kappa scores (0.413, 0.317) with 
task-specific and UNI encoders. As presented in Table 2, our model also exhibits grading 
performance equivalent to that of prominent commercial tools for prostate cancer grading.  
 
Discussion 
Pathologists face increasing challenges delivering timely diagnosis for prostate biopsies. AI offers 
a possible solution to reduce turnaround times, to improve accuracy, and to reduce costs by 
improving pathologist efficiency, upskilling general pathologists, and reducing utilization of 
immunohistochemical staining. Our study investigated the development of an institutional AI 
system for prostate cancer detection, grading, and optimization of IHC ordering. This work 
presents novel modeling approaches, a comparison of large foundation encoder with smaller and 
more efficient task-specific alternatives, and real-world validation. We demonstrate that this 
system could potentially eliminate a significant fraction of immunohistochemical staining and has 
comparable performance with published validations of commercial systems. 
Our main contribution is an approach combining complementary sensitive and specific models to 
reduce ordering of costly immunohistochemistry for equivocal cases, avoiding 44.57% overall IHC 
ordering needs that occurred at our institution with a 95% confidence threshold. Looking at IHC 
requests in our institution from 2005 to 2024, there is an increasing demand for IHC with a yearly 
overall rate of 18.73%, being about 9% in 2005 and reaching 32% in 2024. This study 
demonstrated that our system could augment the diagnostic capability of pathologists and reduce 
the need for IHC ordering, which can help reduce costs, delays in care, and unnecessary anxiety 
for patients who undergo biopsy. 
We developed SCT to address the specific challenges of cancer detection and grading in prostate 
biopsies. Detection of small cancer foci and Gleason pattern grading should benefit from 
modelling relationships between high-power fields. Gleason patterns are more apparent over 
larger areas at lower power, and adjacency of fields with suspicious glands raises the likelihood 
of cancer. While ABMIL lacks the capacity to model interactions, ViT models interactions between 
all fields. In contrast, SCT uses an efficient neighborhood processing approach that progressively 
expands the scope of modeled interactions, reducing computation and trainable parameters 
compared to ViT. This results in superior performance for SCT in almost all comparisons we 
examined. 
Our comparison of a small TSE with the UNI foundation encoder shows indistinguishable 
performance in cancer detection, but some marginal advantage for TSE in grading. TSE 
development was non-trivial involving supervised training using a large public dataset containing 
carcinoma annotations. A foundation encoder avoids this step, but significantly increases 
computational burden for inference. We also note that the TSE produces a visualization by 
classifying individual fields as carcinoma or benign, where obtaining this from a foundation 
encoder requires additional effort. 
Our study has important limitations. Our goal was to develop models for internal use, and to

external datasets. However, our validation data were collected prospectively without filtering or 
enrichment of cases based on grade or cancer burden and represent an unbiased sample of our 
patient population. We expect that similar results could be obtained by other institutions

preanalytical variability or differences in patient populations. An analysis of racial disparities in

analysis of foundation model encoders did not include models beyond UNI or perform additional 
fine tuning. Future research will study this system prospectively over a longer period to analyze 
potential impacts on quality, efficiency, and costs.

1.1 Field-wise carcinoma delineation and Gleason mapping. 
To develop a task-specific encoder for prostate cancer, we first train a high power field classifier 
of benign/carcinoma using PANDA data which comprises of 10616 biopsy slides obtained from  
Radboud University Medical Center and Karolinska Institute (Table S1). The PANDA images were 
tiled into 256x256 pixel high-power fields at 20X objective magnification. The CNN encoder, 
parameterized by 𝛼, is learned to extract high-level d-dimensional features 𝑓(") =  ∅$(𝑡(")) from 
input tiles 𝑡("), which enables the classification layers 𝜑%*𝑓(")+ parameterized by 𝛽 to identify 
carcinoma across slides. As the NU dataset lacks detailed region-level annotations, we utilize tiles 
from the PANDA dataset for training. The encoder and classification layers are trained based on 
the training samples 𝐷&  = .𝑠(") = *𝑡("), 𝑦(")+ | 𝑖= 1, 2, 3, … , 𝑁9, where 𝑠(") is the 𝑖'( training 
sample, and 𝑦(") is the tile-level label. To make the model better at ignoring benign mimickers in 
our dataset, we proceed with a fine-tuning phase following the initial training of the classification 
layers and encoder. First, we apply the model to purely benign slides in NU dataset to identify 
misclassified benign tiles. Given that all the tiles from benign slides are expected to be entirely 
benign, we employ the misclassified benign tiles for targeted refinement in a process known as 
hard mining. To retain the general knowledge learned in the pre-trained model, we only make the 
last three convolution layers of the encoder trainable, which helps in tuning the model against 
false detections while preserving generalizability. 
The NMH dataset lacks image annotations, and so we evaluated the quality of encodings by 
visualizing the benign / carcinoma classifications on NMH whole-slide images. We also trained a 
similar high-power field classifier for Gleason patterns but did not use this for purposes other than 
visualization. 
 
1.2 Tile indexing layer 
Following the feature extraction step, where features from individual tiles across all slides within 
a block are extracted and subsequently concatenated into a 2D sparse matrix, given that SCT 
integrates convolutional operations and local attention mechanisms, the model needs to know the 
spatial arrangement of tiles within each slide of a block. Therefore, we integrate three inputs into 
the model: features extracted from tiles 𝐹∈ℝ)×+, their corresponding  coordinates 𝐶 =
{(𝑥", 𝑦") |  𝑖: 1, 2, … 𝑁} ∈ℝ)×,, and unique indices 𝐼= {𝑠" | 𝑖: 1, 2, … 𝑁} ∈ℝ)×- representing the 
originating slide for each tile containing values starting at 1, with 1 representing the first slide, 2 
for the second slide, and so on. The tile indexing layer plays a crucial role in our model ensuring 
that the coordinates of tiles across all slides within a tissue block are uniquely encoded, 
addressing the potential ambiguity that arises when multiple tiles from different slides share the 
same coordinates. Figure S5 represents the pseudo-code for tile indexing. First, we organize the 
tiles based on which slide they come from. Given tile coordinates 𝐶 and tile indices 𝐼, we group 
tiles by slide using 𝐶.  = {(𝑥", 𝑦") | 𝑠" = 𝑗} where 𝐶. represents the set of the tile coordinates 
belonging to 𝑗'(slide. For each slide j, we find the maximum coordinates *𝑋., 𝑌.+  in both the x and 
y directions, where 𝑋. = max{𝑥" | (𝑥", 𝑦") ∈𝐶.}, and 𝑌. = max{𝑦" | (𝑥", 𝑦") ∈𝐶.}. This means we find 
the farthest right and farthest down that any tile goes on that slide. After finding the maximum 
coordinates for each slide, we adjust the coordinates of subsequent slides based on the maximum 
coordinates of the previous slide as 𝐶.
/  = {(𝑥", 𝑦") | 𝑠" = 𝑗} + *𝑋.0-, 𝑌.0-+, where 𝐶.
/ is the adjusted 
coordinates for 𝑗'(slide. By doing this, we make sure that no two tiles have the same coordinates 
across all slides in a tissue block. 
 
1.3 Sparse Convolutional Transformer (SCT)  
We introduce the Sparse Convolutional Transformer (SCT), an innovative memory-efficient model 
tailored for the processing of gigapixel digital pathology slides. Unlike conventional vision 
transformer models, SCT seamlessly integrates localized details and global patterns through its 
adept utilization of local and global self-attention modules. This section provides a comprehensive 
overview of the SCT architecture and its distinctive features. 
The SCT block takes adjusted tile coordinates 𝐶/ ∈ℝ)×, and extracted features tokens 𝐹∈ℝ)×+ 
as inputs.  Initially, the tiles level features tokens are projected to a lower dimension 𝑍 using a 
linear fully connected layer parameterized by 𝑊∈ℝ1×+ and then normalized by a layer 
normalization to prevent unbiased training due to unexpected higher value features. The resulting 
features and corresponding coordinates are then pass through a Spatially Sparse Convolutional 
Self-Attention (SSC-SA) block, which combines the efficiency of convolutional operations with the 
relationship-modeling capability of self-attention and effectively captures localized spatial and 
channel-wise dependencies within the token receptive fields. A receptive field defines a 2D region 
of neighboring tokens determined by a kernel with a size of 𝑘× 𝑘, and a stride ratio of 𝑠, which 
defines how the model looks at neighboring tokens when performing convolutional and self-
attention operations. A skip connection is applied from the input to the output of the SSC-SA block 
to help the model learn more complex representations while maintaining efficient gradient flow. 
We introduce a Spatially Sparse Pooling (SSP) block is then employed to reduce the number of 
tokens. It aggregates information from neighboring tokens with receptive fields, which helps in the 
extraction of key information while reducing computational complexity. After normalizing the 
resulting feature tokens, they are then passed through a global multi-head self-attention layer 
After normalizing the resulting feature tokens, the feature query, key, and value are then passed 
through a global multi-head self-attention layer, enabling interaction between feature tokens 
across all slides of a block. Finally, after the features are normalized, they proceed through a 
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layer, consisting of two fully connected layers. These layers are 
characterized by 𝑊- ∈ℝ1×1 and 𝑊, ∈ℝ1×1 and utilize the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) 
activation function. to facilitate the flow of information and gradients throughout the network, we 
also added two skip connections between the inputs and outputs of both MLP and the global 
multi-head self-attention layers. 
 
 
 
 1.3.1 Spatially Sparse Convolutional Self-Attention (SSC-SA)  
The sparse convolutional operation is applied to capture local spatial dependencies between 
neighboring tokens within receptive fields, which is summarized in Figure S6a Given a set of 
feature tokens 𝐹∈ℝ)×+ and corresponding coordinates 𝐶/  = {(𝑥", 𝑦") |  𝑖: 1, 2, … 𝑁} ∈ℝ)×,,  we 
initially generate receptive fields for each token by considering its neighboring tokens within the 
specified kernel with size of 𝑘× 𝑘. This generates a 2D region of neighboring tokens centered 
around each token of interest. Given a feature token 𝑓(") ∈ℝ-×1 and corresponding coordinates 
(𝑥", 𝑦"), the receptive field 𝑅" is defined as the set of tokens located within neighboring 𝑘× 𝑘 
kernel. 
𝑅" ∈ℝ2!×1 = O𝑓(.)P Q𝑥. −𝑥"Q < T𝑘
2U , Q𝑦. −𝑦"Q < T𝑘
2U , 𝑗= 1, 2, 3, … 𝑁V 
We introduce an Element-wise Self-Attention (ESA) mechanism that is applied to the receptive 
fields to further refine the representations and capture local spatial and feature dependencies 
across tokens within receptive fields, which is summarized in Figure S6b Given receptive field 
𝑅" ∈ℝ2!×1, we initially leverage a trainable fully connected layer with a weight 𝑊3 ∈ℝ1×4 to 
reduce the dimensionality of 𝑅", where 𝐶 is the embedded feature dimension. Considering the 
resulting receptive field as query 𝑄" ∈ℝ2!×4 , key 𝐾" ∈ℝ2!×4, and value 𝑉" ∈ℝ2!×4 we calculate 
the attended spatial representations 𝑌" ∈ℝ2!×4 using a softmax normalization as below: 
𝐴" ∈ℝ2!×2! = 𝑠oftmax ^𝑄" . 𝐾"
√𝐶a 
𝑌" = 𝐴" . 𝑉" 
Where 𝐴" represents the attention weights between local feature tokens within a receptive field 
𝑅". The next step is to apply attention in the channel direction. To achieve this, we first transpose 
the input receptive field matrix to ensure that the attention mechanism operates along the channel 
dimension. Transposing the input receptive field matrix reorganizes the features such that the 
channels become the new rows and the spatial dimensions become the new columns. This 
transformation allows the attention mechanism to compute relationships between features across 
different channels. Considering the transposed receptive field as query 𝑄"
/ ∈ℝ4×2!, key 𝐾"
/ ∈
ℝ4×2!, and value 𝑉"
/ ∈ℝ4×2! we compute the attended feature representation  𝑌"
/ ∈ℝ2!×4 as 
below. 
𝐴"
/ ∈ℝ4×4 = 𝑠oftmax b𝑄"
/ . 𝐾"
/
√𝑘, c 
𝑌"
/ = 𝐴"
/ . 𝑉"
/ 
The resulting 𝑌"
/ is then transposed and combined with the attended spatial representations 𝑌", 
and subsequently, a trainable fully connected layer with a weight 𝑊5 ∈ℝ4×1 is employed to return 
the dimension back to the input dimension as 𝑅"
/ ∈ℝ2!×1 = (𝑌"
/ + 𝑌") 𝑊5. We also added a skip 
connection between the input and output of the ESA block to ensure generalizability. 
Once the attended receptive field is obtained, the next step involves the application of convolution 
to each receptive field using a convolution weight 𝑊6 ∈ℝ+×2!×1.

where 𝐷 is the output dimension (the number of filters in the convolution) and 𝑓/(") represents the 
resulting token obtained from SSC-SA block for the 𝑖'( receptive field centered around (𝑥", 𝑦"). 
 
1.3.2 Spatially Sparse Pooling (SSP)  
The SSP layer is a key component of the SCT block, as it gathers information from neighboring 
tokens through receptive fields and enables the extraction of important details while minimizing 
computational complexity and providing multi-scale representations. In the SSP layer, the pooling 
operation aggregates information from neighboring tokens within receptive fields. These receptive 
fields are constructed based on the specified pool size and stride. We define a receptive field as 
neighboring tokens centered around each token within a specified spatial range. Given the pooling 
size of 𝑝 and stride of 𝑠, a receptive field 𝑅" ∈ℝ2!×1is calculated as below. 
𝑅" ∈ℝ2!×1 = O𝑓(.)P Q𝑥. −𝑥"Q < T𝑝
2U , Q𝑦. −𝑦"Q < T𝑝
2U , 𝑗= 1, 2, 3, … 𝑁 , 𝑖∈𝑆V 
𝑆= {𝑖| 𝑥" ∈𝑋 with stride 𝑠 , 𝑦" ∈𝑌 with stride 𝑠} 
Where 𝑋 represents the set of possible 𝑥-coordinates and 𝑌 represents the set of possible 𝑦-
coordinates, and S contains the indices 𝑖 where both the 𝑥" and 𝑦" coordinates lie within the 2D 
space defined by 𝑋 and 𝑌, with a stride 𝑠. 
Once the receptive fields are formed, we perform pooling to aggregate information from the tokens 
within each receptive field. The pooling operation typically aggregates tokens through a maximum 
or average operation across the tokens in a receptive field. For instance, if we consider max 
pooling, the 𝑚'( element of pooled feature 𝑓<
(") for token 𝑖 located at (𝑥", 𝑦") can be calculated as 
below. 
𝑓<
