Abstract 
Collagen, a key structural component of the extracellular matrix, undergoes significant 
remodeling during carcinogenesis. However, the important role of collagen levels in breast 
cancer diagnostics still lacks effective in vivo detection techniques to provide a deeper 
understanding. This study presents photoacoustic spectral analysis improved by machine 
learning as a promising non-invasive diagnostic method, focusing on exploring collagen as a 
salient biomarker. Murine model experiments revealed more profound associations of 
collagen with other cancer components than in normal tissues. Moreover, an optimal set of 
feature wavelengths was identified by a genetic algorithm for enhanced diagnostic 
performance, among which 75% were from collagen-dominated absorption wavebands. Using 
optimal spectra, the diagnostic algorithm achieved 72% accuracy, 66% sensitivity, and 78% 
specificity, surpassing full-range spectra by 6%, 4%, and 8%, respectively. The proposed 
photoacoustic methods examine the feasibility of offering valuable biochemical insights into 
existing techniques, showing great potential for early-stage cancer detection.

INTRODUCTION  
 
 
  
 
- 3 - 
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women, and its incidence has 
continued to rise by 0.6% per year since 2004, according to Cancer Statistics 2024 [1]. Early-
stage breast cancer is curable in approximately 75% of patients [2]. Therefore, early diagnosis 
is vital for improving survival and prognosis. Mammography is currently the primary method 
for clinical breast cancer screening [3]. However, it has a risk of radiation exposure and is 
susceptible to high breast tissue density, which leads to low sensitivity (24–47%) [4–6]. 
Ultrasonography is a vastly used adjunct but suffers from operator dependency and 
insufficient specificity (65-89%) [7,8]. Further, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has 
been used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients, it is restricted by the high costs [9]. 
Thus, the advent of novel practical tools for providing complementary information and 
expanding the scope of cancer research is in demand. 
The impact of extracellular matrix (ECM) on the behavior of malignant cells has become a 
developing research area in oncology. Collagen is the most abundant component of ECM that 
acts as a structural scaffold for tissue homeostasis [10]. Recent studies indicate that collagen 
degradation and redeposition accompany tumor initiation and progression, thereby 
modulating ECM to become a favorable place for the interaction, invasion, and metastasis of 
cancer cells [11]. Literature has reported that the collagen level can be applied as an important 
biomarker for predicting immunotherapy resistance [12] and median survival of patients [13]. 
For the characterization of collagen in bio-tissues, current modalities primarily include 
histopathological staining, second-harmonic generation [14], and mass spectrometry [15]. 
These methods mainly use ex vivo samples, which are invasive and hinder their clinical 
application in early-stage cancer screening and diagnosis. 
Photoacoustic spectral analysis (PASA) is an emerging technique for non-invasive cancer 
diagnostics since it can capture the composition and physical properties of biomacromolecules 
based on their unique optical absorption [16]. The photoacoustic (PA) modality is applicable 
for in vivo utility because it can reach deep bio-tissues, not relying on light coherence [17,18].

Ultrasonic signals generated by exposed chromophores experience only one-way propagation 
before detection, which minimizes the attenuation. The effectiveness of PASA in 
investigating the microstructures of collagen and lipid for disease evaluation has already been 
examined in many studies on Crohn’s disease [19], cirrhosis or fatty liver disease [20], 
osteoporosis [21–23], and prostate cancer [24]. Our group proposed a PA parameter “area of 
power spectrum density (APSD)” to reflect the contents of biomacromolecules, and has 
successfully used it for identifying myocardial infarction boundary [25], skin tumors [26], and 
molecular breast cancer subtypes [27]. For breast cancer evaluation nowadays, most studies 
have mainly focused on PA imaging (PAI) for tumor angiogenesis and hemoglobin oxygen 
saturation [28]. Studies discussing the potential of PASA to reveal more detailed information 
about the collagen status of ECM related to carcinogenesis are lacking [29]. 
On the other hand, various rapidly developing machine learning (ML) methods provide 
effective ways to extract information from a plethora of collected biomedical data [28–30]. To 
reveal the intrinsic patterns of physiological processes, unsupervised algorithms like 
hierarchal clustering, correlation network analysis, and community detection have been 
widely applied to datasets of genomic sequencing, proteomics, and neuroscience. These 
methods contribute to understanding the basic mechanism of diseases [30] and the functional 
connectivity of the brain [31], which also show great potential for in vivo PASA to 
characterize biomacromolecule changes caused by cancer initiation [32]. Furthermore, to 
enhance the performance of diagnostics, a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed as a powerful 
tool for selecting optimal features as inputs for supervised models [33,34]. GA-facilitated 
small ML models, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), partial least-squares discriminant 
analysis (PLSDA), and support vector machine discriminant analysis (SVMDA), were 
reported applicable for molecular datasets and can achieve higher accuracy with reduced 
computational cost compared to deep learning models with image inputs [35–37]. Heretofore, 
the usage of GA in vibrational spectroscopy is restrained to pure optical techniques such as 
 
 
  
 
- 5 - 
Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy [38]. Limited work has been done on 
PASA to select the optimal set of feature wavelengths for improving cancer theranostics.  
This study sheds light on non-invasive in vivo breast cancer diagnostics by employing 
PASA with multiple ML methods to characterize collagen as a biomacromolecule biomarker 
of ECM remodeling due to carcinogenesis. The murine model was selected for a feasibility 
study because the xenograft was located at the superficial layer of the mouse body. 
Furthermore, the collagen in murine malignancy was sufficient to exhibit significant changes 
from those in normal tissues, as proven by our histopathological studies. A schematic diagram 
in Figure 1(a) explains the relationships of ML algorithms and the logical order of their 
corresponding research targets. One hundred samples from murine models with a ratio of 1:1 
for the malignant and normal were tested to acquire the spectra of a PA parameter APSD 
using lasers with wavelengths of 1200–1700 nm, where collagen, water, and lipid exhibited 
significant absorption. In the NIR-Ⅱ region, hemoglobin, an essential PA agent for vessel 
imaging, manifested insignificant absorbance [39], causing little bias to the collagen detection 
based on the PASA technique. Concerning optical absorption spectra provided by previous 
studies [16,39], the wavelength range demonstrating the most prominent absorption for a 
certain biomacromolecule among all studied molecules was determined by applying 
hierarchical clustering to the APSD spectra for in vivo detection, which is referred to as the 
dominated absorption waveband. Then, other unsupervised algorithms were used to analyze 
the molecular variation between two types of tissues. The collagen content change and its 
correlation with lipid were discussed. Based on the evidence provided by PASA above, the 
GA method was utilized on PA spectra to pinpoint an optimized set of wavelengths, termed 
feature wavelengths, whose APSDs could enhance the performance of breast cancer 
diagnostics utilizing the most appropriate supervised classifiers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1 
Animal models and experimental protocol 
Fifty xenografts were obtained by implanting human breast cancer cells into the mammary 
glands of nude mice. To evaluate the heterogeneity of breast cancers, we used three distinct 
cell lines (MCF-7, MCF-10CA1a-HER2, and MDA-MB-231) to establish xenografts 
representing molecular subtypes of luminal (n=13), HER2 (n=19), and triple negative (n=18), 
respectively. In vivo, PA detection was conducted after the xenografts reached a diameter of 1 
cm. Nude mice were anesthetized during the experiments using pentobarbital sodium (1%) via 
intraperitoneal injection. Normal samples were collected from the opposite tissues of 
xenografts. The Animal Welfare and Ethics Group of the Department of Laboratory Animal 
Science, Fudan University, approved the study protocol.

2.2 Histopathology and statistical analysis  
Nude mice were euthanized after the experiments, and Masson’s trichome and hematoxylin-
eosin (H&E) staining were performed to assess the collagen and lipid in tissues. To quantify 
the levels of biomacromolecules, we calculated the relative contents from the cross-sections 
of xenografts and the normal tissues under PA detection. The relative collagen and lipid 
contents were defined as the percentage of the positively stained area on the entire section. As 
illustrated in Figure S1, luminal breast cancer had a significantly higher collagen level than 
do the other two molecular subtypes. Statistical analysis was conducted to compare collagen 
contents of normal and cancerous samples based on five independently built murine models 
bearing luminal cancers using t-tests in Prism 9.4.1 software. Collagen and lipid contents of 
all cancerous samples were also analyzed.  
 
2.3 Experimental setup for in vivo PA measurements 
The experimental setup (Figure 1(b)) comprised laser triggering and ultrasonic signal 
acquisition parts. A tunable optical parametric oscillator (Phocus Mobile, OPOTEK, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA) was programmed to emit lasers with wavelengths switching from 1200 
nm to 1700 nm at a constant 10 nm interval, a pulse width of 2–5 ns, and a repetition rate of 
10 Hz. Collagen, the targeted biomacromolecule of this study, shows a strong light absorption 
in the above wavebands [39]. The fluence of the laser source is depicted in Figure S2. The 
laser beam was split using a dichroic mirror. One beam with 10% laser energy was focused on 
the blackbody to produce PA signals for calibrating the laser energy varying with time and 
wavelength. Here, the blackbody, a piece of black rubber tape pasted on a water tank, had a 
uniform and stable optical absorption. The ultrasonic signals from the blackbody were 
collected using a 5 MHz transducer (V302, Immersion Transducers, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, 
Japan) and amplified by 25 dB using an amplifier (5073PR, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). 
 
 
  
 
- 8 - 
The other beam with 90% laser energy irradiated the sample, with a weak focal spot of 1 cm 
diameter to cover the entire xenograft, while the optical energy density was controlled to 
below 25 mJ·cm-2 to meet the safety limit specified by the American National Standards 
Institute for human skin (100 mJ·cm-2 for laser wavelengths ranging from 1050 to 1500 nm, 
and 1 J·cm-2 for wavelengths from 1500 to 1700 nm) [40].  
The ultrasonic coupling devices were designed to maintain the stability of the experimental 
system. A water capsule was created using a thin square acrylic dish with a hole of 2 cm 
diameter at the center of the bottom. The hole was sealed with a thin plastic membrane, and 
the dish was filled with a shallow 0.4 cm layer of water. During detection, nude mice were 
raised on a lifting table to let the cancerous or normal tissues slightly press against the 
capsule. A small bulge was formed for good coupling. The surface distance between the 
tissues and the water surface was maintained at nearly 1 mm to minimize the water-induced 
light attenuation. Ultrasonic signals from the xenografts were collected utilizing a needle 
hydrophone (HNC-1500, ONDA Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) and amplified by 35 dB using an 
amplifier (5072PR, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Signals received a 1 MHz high-pass filter 
to eliminate low system noise and were stored in an oscilloscope (HDO6000, Teledyne 
Lecroy, USA) at a sampling rate of 250 MHz. To obtain an adequate signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR), 64 average measurements were taken, which required approximately 40 s. Each 
complete experiment, consisting of 51 wavelengths, took about 34 mins, slightly less than the 
duration of anesthesia. 
 
2.4 Multi-wavelength PASA 
The signals were processed using MATLAB software (R2017b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, 
USA) to construct PA spectra as a raw dataset for further ML analysis in the following steps, 
Step 1: The PA signals from samples (Figures 2(a)-(b)) were divided by the peak-to-peak 
values of the corresponding blackbody signals; Step 2: The corrected signals were 
 
 
  
 
- 9 - 
transformed into power spectral density curves (Figures 2(c)-(d)) using Welch’s method with 
a moving Hamming window, followed by calibrating under the frequency response of the 
hydrophone; Step 3: All the density curves for the 51 laser wavelengths constituted the 
physiochemical spectrogram (Figures 2(e)-(f)), where the x-axis represented the optical 
wavelength, and the y-axis indicated the frequency distribution of ultrasonic signals; Step 4: 
The PA parameter was calculated by integrating the calibrated power spectral density as

Step 5: APSDs from 51 detection wavelengths (1200–1700 nm, Δλ  = 10 nm) composed a 
spectrum (Figures 2(g)-(h)) that was unique for each sample. The raw dataset used in this 
study consisted of APSD spectra of 50 normal samples and 50 cancerous samples.

2.5 Unsupervised machine learning: characterizing carcinogenesis-related 
biomacromolecule  
2.5.1 Hierarchical clustering 
The partition of absorption wavebands for studying biomacromolecules in the NIR-Ⅱ window 
(1200–1700 nm) was achieved using hierarchical clustering implemented in the R package 
Pheatmap (version 1.0.12) [41]. Using Euclidean distances, nodes (APSDs) or clusters were 
 
 
  
 
- 11 - 
linked to the closest node. An agglomerative algorithm was used to determine the 
communities of the variables (APSDs of each wavelength or sample) based on their 
similarities. A binary tree illustrated the hierarchical structure of the variables. Variables were 
standardized using z-scores (mean centering and scaled variance) before analysis.  
 
2.5.2 Correlation heat map 
The distribution of APSDs at each wavelength was evaluated for normality using the Shapiro-
Wilk test in Prism 9.4.1 software. Then, the associations of sample APSDs at any two 
wavelengths were computed using Spearman correlation coefficients (SCCs) and visualized 
using a correlation heat map (51×51 symmetric diagonal matrix). The APSDs of two 
wavelengths were considered to have sufficient interconnection if their SCC surpassed 0.9. A 
threshold of 0.9 was applied to the SCCs to distinguish the highly correlated regions.  
 
2.5.3 Wavelength network acquisition and community detection 
The correlations of biomacromolecules were further investigated by network analysis of 
highly correlated regions in the heat map. The elements in these regions were assigned a value 
of 1, whereas the rest were 0. Consequently, the binary matrix was acquired to build an 
unweighted and undirected network of wavelengths using the R package Ggraph (version 
2.1.0) [42]. The WalkTrap algorithm was used to partition the network into communities 
using the random walk-based similarity between nodes (wavelengths) and clusters to cut the 
hierarchical structure [43]. Nodes within the same community were more similar to each 
other. We calculated the betweenness centrality (BC) of the nodes to evaluate their impact on 
the network. BC is the frequency of a node found along the shortest path between two other 
nodes [44]. 
 
2.6 Supervised classification: in vivo breast cancer diagnostics  
 
 
  
 
- 12 - 
2.6.1 GA: feature optical wavelength selection  
GA selected feature optical wavelengths for PASA-based breast cancer diagnostics to enhance 
model performance while reducing required wavelengths [45]. Step 1: A population of 64 
individuals with random subsets of wavelengths was generated. Root mean square error for 
cross-validation (RMSECV) was calculated using multiple linear regression (MLR) between 
individual variables and sample response variables (1 for cancerous, 0 for normal). Step 2: 
Poor-performing individuals (RMSECV > median) were excluded; the remaining individuals 
exchanged random variables (double crossover) to replenish the population. Step 3: New 
populations were re-evaluated, discarded, mutated, and bred until steps 1 and 2 were repeated 
reaching 50 generations. These three steps were performed with 100 replicate runs to build a 
collection of optimal models. The variables resulting in the lowest RMSECV were selected as 
feature wavelengths. 
 
2.6.2 KNN 
For a more comprehensive consideration, three supervised classifiers applicable to small 
datasets were tested to compare their performances on GA-optimized PASA for breast cancer 
diagnostics. All approaches were implemented in MATLAB software (R2017b, MathWorks, 
Natick, MA, USA) with the PLS Toolbox v.9.3 (Eigenvector Research Inc., Wenatchee, WA, 
USA). KNN is a distance-related model that assigns the class of an unknown sample by the 
vote of a small group of its nearest neighbors [45]. K is commonly chosen as an odd number 
ranging from 3 to 9. The closeness of the samples was calculated using the Euclidean 
distance. 
 
2.6.3 PLSDA 
PLSDA is a linear classifier developed from the partial least-squares regression [46]. Linear 
regression was performed between the latent variables (LVs) extracted from the predictors 
 
 
  
 
- 13 - 
(APSD spectra) and the response variables, set as the same as GA. Several independent LVs 
with eigenvalues > 1 were extracted to describe the maximum amount of data variance. 
Samples whose statistics Q residuals and Hotelling’s T2 exceeded the 99% confidence level 
were excluded from the dataset as outliers until the final model was constructed [47]. A 
probabilistic threshold was calculated to identify the cancerous samples, assuming a Gaussian 
distribution of the regression values. 
 
2.6.4 SVMDA 
This study uses SVMDA as a nonlinear classifier, adjusting a hyperplane with an optimal 
margin to classify samples projected into high-dimensional spaces [48]. A radial basis 
function (RBF) with a Gaussian kernel type was used to transform the PA dataset. The shape 
of the hyperplane was modified by the gamma (𝛾) to alter the RBF. The width of the margin 
was penalized by the cost (c) to constrain the support vectors lying within it. A search over 
grids from 10-6 to 109 uniformly spaced in the log was applied to determine the appropriate 
value for 𝛾 and c, minimizing the misclassification fraction in the testing set [47].  
 
2.6.5 Model validation and evaluation 
The reliability of supervised ML models was ensured using ten-fold cross-validation [49]. The 
samples were divided into ten equal-sized subsets. Each subset was used as a testing set once 
to verify the classifiers built employing the remaining subsets (calibration sets). The mean 
accuracies, specificities, and sensitivities were calculated for the calibration and the testing 
sets. Details regarding the sample allocation are listed in Table 1. The confusion matrices, 
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and the area under the curve (AUC) were also 
considered to evaluate the performance of the model.

RESULTS  
3.1 Histopathological analysis of normal and cancerous tissues 
Masson’s trichrome staining was performed on both normal and cancerous tissues to assess 
the relative collagen content. As depicted in the statistical results in Figure 3(a), normal 
samples owned a significantly elevated collagen level. Representative staining images are 
exhibited in Figure 3(b). Observations revealed that collagen fibers formed a loose and 
regular network in normal samples while they became disordered in cancerous samples. This 
finding was also reported in other literature [50–52]. The histopathological results proved that 
collagen underwent significant remodeling in the murine xenografts, providing a solid basis 
for PASA for cancer diagnostics.

staining images. The statistical analysis was assessed using the t-test. 
 
3.2 Determining the dominated absorption wavebands of biomacromolecules 
 
 
  
 
- 15 - 
Among the optical absorption coefficients of the three biomacromolecules shown in Figure 
4(a), collagen has a gradually increasing absorbance in the NIR-II window (1200–1700 nm) 
[21,32]. Lipid has a growing absorbance at wavelengths beyond 1650 nm. To eliminate the 
spectra bias caused by testing concentrations, the absorption spectra were normalized as 
revealed in Figure 4(b). The tape plot in Figure 4(c) interprets the APSD spectra of all the 
tested samples and their standard deviations (SDs). Compared to the normal samples, the 
cancerous samples exhibited similar profiles but had approximate APSDs in 1410-1520 nm or 
lower APSDs in 1200-1400 nm and 1530-1700 nm, which was consistent with our 
histopathological findings that cancerous samples had relatively lower collagen contents than 
normal samples. Moreover, the cancerous group showcased a more extensive variation of 
APSDs; this could be interpreted by the fact that ECM deteriorated with cancer initiation. The 
inter-cancer heterogeneity of biomacromolecules increased due to the malignant 
differentiation [53].  
The hierarchical clustering heat map of the APSD dataset is shown in Figure 4(d). It was 
processed in two directions: wavelengths and samples. The binary tree of laser wavelengths 
drawn along the rows was partitioned into three distinct segments. This division result 
determined the dominant absorption wavebands of collagen, water, and lipid for the in vivo 
PA study. A schematic axis (Figure 4(e)) clarifies the absorption wavebands: collagen-
dominated (1200-1400 nm and 1530-1630 nm), lipid-dominated (1640-1700 nm), and water-
dominated (1410-1520 nm). The classification, consistent with the normalized optical 
absorption depicted in Figure 4(b), provides a basis for in vivo detecting biomacromolecules 
under specific wavebands. Two separate wavebands, 1200-1400 nm and 1530-1630 nm, were 
considered for collagen because the literature reported that both 1370 nm [54] and 1550 nm 
[23] lasers were exploited for collagen measurements. In the axis of Figure 4(e), “Collagen 
1” and “Collagen 2” symbolize two detection windows for collagen, unrelated to collagen 
subtypes. The review [55] indicates that no research has yet validated variations in PA signals 
 
 
  
 
- 16 - 
across collagen subtypes. On the other hand, the binary tree of samples was drawn along the 
columns. The clustering results appeared disordered for two groups of samples; this suggested 
that more elaborate ML techniques were needed to unravel the underlying patterns of 
molecular changes induced by carcinogenesis.

biomacromolecules, with two collagen-dominated wavebands labeled as Collagen 1 and 
Collagen 2. 
 
3.3 Assessing collagen remodeling of ECM due to carcinogenesis 
The SCCs of the APSD spectra for all the wavelengths are shown as heat maps (Figures 5(a)-
(b)), serving as a foundation for characterizing the correlation of biomacromolecule content in 
tissues. Both maps of normal and cancerous samples revealed all SCCs exceeding 0.4. 
Intriguingly, the cancerous samples represented an elevated correlation of APSDs. The APSD 
spectra from the collagen-dominated (1200–1400 nm and 1530–1630 nm) and the lipid-
dominated absorption wavebands (1640–1700 nm) shared more intense similarities than the 
water-dominated absorption wavebands (1410–1520 nm). These results embodied the 
physiological environment change due to the formation of breast cancer. 
The most correlated regions with SCCs > 0.9 in the heat map of cancerous samples are 
drawn in Figure 5(c). Mutual relations of collagen and lipid appeared in the regions outside 
the blocks restricted by specific biomacromolecules. This cross-impact was also observed in 
our previous study on ex vivo prostate-tissue specimens [56]. The wavelength networks of the 
cancerous samples are exhibited in Figure 5(d). Nodes were arranged clockwise first by the 
size of communities and then the number of edges between them and other nodes. 
Communities were specified by the biomacromolecules whose absorption-dominated 
wavebands occupied the majority of wavelengths. The radial layout of the network and 
communities was contrived to deliberate on the molecule-dependent impact. Three significant 
communities were discovered for collagen and water. The most prominent communities 
consisted of wavelengths chiefly from the collagen-dominated absorption waveband. 
Wavelengths in the lipid-dominated absorption waveband but assigned to the collagen-
dominated community are highlighted in blue boxes. These traits indicated that collagen 
content had profound linkages with lipid in the tumor ECM. 
 
 
  
 
- 18 - 
  The normalized BCs of nodes are represented in Figure 5(e) to assess the positions of 
wavelengths within the network. A wavelength owning higher BC indicated that its APSD 
had more direct or indirect connections with APSDs of the other wavelengths. The prominent 
peaks, appearing at 1590 nm,1520 nm, and 1620 nm, indicated the significant influence of 
collagen-dominated absorption wavebands on the correlation network, suggesting that evident 
collagen remodeling of ECM accompanied carcinogenesis and might coordinate the behaviors 
of lipid.

3.4 In vivo breast cancer diagnostics based on PASA 
3.4.1 GA-based feature optical wavelength selection 
The GA technique built 158 MLR models through 100 runs, 50 generations per run. Figure 
6(a) depicts the RMSECVs of all the models varying with wavelengths by rows, arranging in 
decreasing values from the top to the bottom. The inclusion frequencies of the wavelengths 
within the 158 models are shown in Figure 6(b). The wavelengths with frequencies greater 
than 0.5 are labeled above the bars. Overall, 83% of these frequently employed wavelengths 
were from collagen-dominated absorption wavebands. Figure 6(c) interprets the RMSECVs 
of all the models depending on the number of included wavelengths, varying from 4 to 10. 
The best regression model owning the lowest RMSECV was established by APSDs from 8 
wavelengths: 1280, 1300, 1330, 1360, 1400, 1430, 1510, and 1540 nm. These wavelengths 
were selected as the feature optical wavelengths for breast cancer diagnostics, among which 
wavelengths belonging to the collagen-, water-, and lipid-dominated absorption wavebands 
accounted for 75%, 25%, and 0%, respectively.

3.4.2 Enhanced discriminant models utilizing feature wavelength spectra 
Although full-range wavelength PA spectra (1200–1700 nm, ∆𝜆 = 10 nm) contained complete 
information on biomacromolecules, some redundant features might prevent ML classifiers 
from projecting the normal and cancerous samples into proper data spaces and deciding a 
precise partition for identification. The performances of supervised ML models for breast 
cancer diagnostics are summarized in Table 2. While using full-range wavelength spectra, the 
linear PLSDA model and the nonlinear SVMDA model led to low sensitivity or specificity on 
the calibration set. Compared to these two algorithms, the distance-based KNN model had 
relatively balanced accuracies for the negative and positive samples on the cross-validation 
sets but only demonstrated a moderate diagnostics capability. The confusion matrix and the 
ROC with AUC for the testing set of KNN are displayed in Figures 6(d)-(e).  
  Furthermore, while using feature wavelength (8 wavelengths obtained from GA) APSD 
spectra, all the ML models underwent a performance elevation. The PLSDA model had more 
evident progress than the KNN model. However, its sensitivity deteriorated sharply compared 
to specificity. The SVMDA model revealed the best capability among the three ML 
algorithms. Figures 6(f)-(g) exhibit the confusion matrix and ROC for the testing set of 
SVMDA. The results interpreted that GA-selected feature optical wavelength spectra with a 
nonlinear SVMDA model could improve the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of breast 
cancer diagnostics via PASA by 6%, 4%, and 8% in comparison with the full-range 
wavelength spectra.

DISCUSSION  
Clinical breast cancer diagnostics currently rely primarily on mammography and 
ultrasonography. While these modalities are extensively used, they fail to provide information 
beyond tissue morphology. PASA, which is sensitive to biochemical changes, offers a deeper 
molecular understanding of ECM and shows great potential for early cancer diagnostics. 
Collagen, a major fibrous protein in the ECM, has been shown to exhibit significant 
remodeling of content and arrangement during cancer initiation and growth, creating a fertile 
ECM that facilitates cancer cell proliferation and invasion [57]. Therefore, collagen is 
proposed as a biomacromolecule biomarker for cancer theranostics. 
However, the application of PASA in cancer research poses great challenges. The complex 
compositions of cancer tissues make it difficult to directly interpret information about specific 
biomacromolecules. PASA, powered by multiple ML methods, offers a comprehensive 
 
 
  
 
- 22 - 
molecular insight into breast cancer without requiring explicit knowledge of tissue 
composition. This modality aims to improve cancer diagnostics and reduce detection costs. 
Additionally, unlike mammography, the PA technique is not strongly influenced by high 
breast density [8], benefiting populations at increased risk. The above benefits of PASA with 
ML can expand the scope of traditional clinical modalities. 
The current study analyzed the feasibility of improving in vivo PASA using ML to explore 
collagen change as a prominent biomarker for breast cancer diagnostics. Histopathological 
studies demonstrated a significant difference in collagen contents between the murine normal 
and cancerous tissues. The spectra of APSD, a PA parameter reflecting molecular contents, 
were investigated. First, the joint use of unsupervised ML algorithms was applied to mine out 
the characteristics of biomacromolecules. The dominated absorption wavebands of collagen 
(1200–1400 nm and 1530–1630 nm), water (1410–1520 nm), and lipid (1640–1700 nm) were 
confirmed as a basis for in vivo PA studies by hierarchical clustering. The correlation heat 
map revealed that collagen content varied significantly between the normal and cancerous 
tissues. Collagen and lipid had a high correlation of content in the tumor ECM where the bio-
tissue heterogeneity was enhanced. The wavelengths in the two largest communities of 
network analysis results were mainly from collagen-dominated absorption wavebands, with 
wavelengths owning the maximal BCs also within this waveband, suggesting the synergistic 
impact of collagen remodeling on other ECM biomacromolecules due to carcinogenesis. 
Compared to algorithms used for unmixing PA spectra, the performance of proposed PASA 
methods is not strongly influenced by the optical absorption spectra selected for 
biomacromolecules. Due to the substantial variation in the physiological environment, 
determining precise absorption spectra to use as a benchmark for spectral unmixing remains 
challenging. 
Based on the cancer-induced variation of bio-condition validated above, the feature optical 
wavelengths for breast cancer diagnostics were selected by GA to enhance the performance of 
 
 
  
 
- 23 - 
supervised ML classifiers. Eight wavelengths were obtained from the best of 158 GA models: 
1280, 1300, 1330, 1360, 1400, 1430, 1510, and 1540 nm, in which collagen-dominated 
absorption wavebands occupied almost the entirety. Previous research has demonstrated lipid 
absorption peak at 1200–1250 nm [26,58]. Since this waveband did not exist in the feature 
wavelengths or possessed minimal BCs, it did not impact on the findings of this study. 
Furthermore, The SVMDA model exploiting feature wavelength spectra, reducing by 85% of 
the scanning wavelength number, achieved 72% accuracy, 66% sensitivity, and 78% 
specificity of diagnostics, surpassing those reached by the distance-based KNN model using 
full-range wavelength spectra (66%, 62%, and 70%, respectively). This improvement 
demonstrates the advantages of feature wavelength PA spectra over the sophisticated full-
range wavelength dataset. Furthermore, GA proved to be a more potent ML technique for data 
dimension reduction than other algorithms such as principal component analysis. Figure S3 
illustrates that primary LVs (eigenvalues > 1) fail to differentiate between the two sample 
groups. In general, the GA-optimized spectra could capture the most crucial molecular 
information reflecting the formation of cancerous lesions. Since the data redundancy was 
minimized in feature wavelength spectra, the SVMDA could take full advantage of its 
nonlinear kernel to partition samples in high dimensional spaces. 
The PASA interpreted here is a preclinical feasibility study with certain limitations. First, 
the accuracy of diagnostics using supervised classification models can still be enhanced. This 
preliminary study used raw PA signals for spectral analysis, neglecting the light attenuation in 
tissues. Signal correction to compensate for optical fluence, which decreases with depths, 
shows promises of improving accuracy [59], but a well-established 3D model for detailed 
cancer composition is required for simulations. We are dedicated to building a collagen 
distribution model based on Masson’s trichome staining images, which will be reported in our 
future papers. Second, the histopathological studies based on biopsy slides had limited ability 
to reflect the condition of entire tissues detected by the PA method which was a 3D detection 
 
 
  
 
- 24 - 
technique. This discrepancy could hinder histopathological analysis from providing a precise 
evaluation of PA findings. In future works, we plan to increase the number of slides per 
sample or test other molecular analysis modalities like mass spectrometry. Third, other 
biomacromolecules such as lipid were not emphasized in this paper. The murine models 
established here were under basic feeding standards, owning quite lower lipid contents 
assessed by histopathology compared to collagen as displayed in Figure S4(a)-(b). This 
might reduce the accuracy of lipid content statistics and prevent embodying the role of lipid in 
carcinogenesis. We plan to build lipid-rich murine models by incrementally increasing fat in 
their diet in our future work. 
Despite these limitations, this study provides effective methods for in vivo characterizing 
collagen content as an important biomacromolecule biomarker to achieve breast cancer 
diagnostics based on murine models using improved PASA aided by ML. For future 
generalization to human subjects, considerable effort is required. As human mammary tissues 
may differ in collagen compositions and lipid levels, the proposed methods can contribute to 
re-evaluating the relationship between these two important biomacromolecules and 
determining the feature wavelengths for cancer diagnostics. To translate the technique into 
clinical trials, PASA can be readily integrated into existing ultrasound imaging and PAI 
systems, realizing multimodal measurements. The primary technical challenges will arise 
from the thick tissues obscuring the human breast cancer lesions. Light attenuation in the 
covering tissues is likely to be strong and wavelength-dependent, resulting in spectral coloring 
and reduced SNR. To alleviate these problems, ultrasonic localization will be engaged to 
isolate the PA signals from the ROI [60], along with model-based fluence correction 
techniques to augment the desired signals. Fusing PA spectra with other data types, such as 
multi-omics results, to develop a holistic view of cancer development using powerful ML 
algorithms will also be a promising research orientation in the future.

CONCLUSION 
This study tested the feasibility of PASA powered by ML for in vivo measurements of 
collagen as a biomacromolecule biomarker of ECM remodeling to realize breast cancer 
diagnostics, focusing on murine models. A spectral parameter APSD was calculated to semi-
quantify molecular contents. Unsupervised ML methods, including hierarchical clustering, 
correlation heat map, and network analysis, were employed to fully investigate the 
characteristics of collagen and its correlation with lipid. The GA was utilized to mine out an 
optimal set of optical wavelengths whose PA spectra contained the most essential information 
for breast cancer diagnostics. We found that the heterogeneity of ECM was enhanced due to 
carcinogenesis, and collagen had intensive correlations with lipid in cancerous environments. 
The GA-selected feature wavelength spectra achieved 72% accuracy, 66% sensitivity, and 
78% specificity based on the SVMDA model, exceeding full-range spectra with the KNN 
model by 6%, 4%, and 8% while saving 85% of the scanning wavelengths. 75% of the feature 
wavelengths were from the collagen-dominated absorption waveband. Histological analysis 
confirmed a significant difference between the collagen contents of normal and cancerous 
tissues in murine models. The proposed methods provide complementary biochemical 
information on bio-tissues to current clinical modalities and have great potential to advance 
breast cancer theranostics.
