ABSTRACT
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is characterized by substantial genetic heterogeneity, posing challenges in identifying reliable
biomarkers for improved diagnosis and treatment. Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) has traditionally been regarded as a
predictive biomarker, given its association with immune response and treatment efficacy. In this study, we treated TMB as a
response variable to identify genes highly correlated with it, aiming to understand its genetic drivers. We conducted a thorough
investigation of recent feature selection methods through extensive simulations, selecting PC-Screen, DC-SIS, and WD-Screen
as top performers. These methods handle multi-omics structures effectively, and can accommodate both categorical and
continuous data types at the same time for each gene. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via cBioPortal, we
combined copy number alteration (CNA), mRNA expression and DNA methylation data as multi-omics predictors and applied
these methods, selecting genes consistently identified across all three methods. 13 common genes were identified, including
HSD17B4, PCBD2, which show strong associations with TMB. Our multi-omics strategy and robust feature selection approach
provide insights into the genetic determinants of TMB, with implications for targeted LUAD therapies.
Introduction
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a predominant subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounts for nearly 40% of all
lung cancer cases worldwide, making it a critical focus in oncology research. According to the Global Cancer Observatory
(GLOBOCAN), lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with over 2 million new cases and approximately
1.8 million deaths reported annually?, and LUAD comprises the majority of these cases. The prognosis for LUAD patients
remains poor, with a five-year survival rate below 20%, particularly due to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options are
limited.
Recent advancements in multi-omics technologies have provided a deeper understanding of the molecular landscape of
LUAD, and several studies have focused on multi-omics approaches and machine learning techniques to extract highly related
genes. For example, using feature selection frameworks with mutual information and random forest, the researchers found a
consensus set of twelve genes with significant diagnostic potential, which could differentiate LUAD from normal samples with
high accuracy?.However, despite these advancements, high genetic and molecular heterogeneity in LUAD continues to limit the
applicability of existing biomarkers for early and personalized diagnostics.
The analysis of multi-omics data presents significant challenges due to its high dimensionality, with tens of thousands
of genes but only a few hundred subjects, and the integration of multiple data platforms. This structure introduces a high
degree of noise, and creates an array-like predictor structure, where for n subjects, the predictors not only has the regular high
dimensionality p but also additional dimension d associated with d different platforms. This complexity makes traditional
analysis methods ineffective and sometimes even incapable of handling predictors with such multi-layer structure. As a result,
effective feature selection is crucial for detecting signals in this noisy environment.
Feature selection, or feature screening has long been a hot topic in statistical and machine learning research, particularly due
to its critical role in managing high-dimensional and complex data. Fan and Lv’s introduction of Sure Independent Screening
(SIS) was a pivotal development, demonstrating that SIS could reliably identify all true predictors in sufficiently large samples,
hence the term "sure" screening?. Their work inspired further advancements in sure screening, with methods like Distance
Correlation based Sure Independence Screening (DC-SIS)?, Projection based Sure Independence Screening (PC-Screen)?,
Stable Correlation Screening (SC-SIS)?, and Multivariate Rank Distance Correlation based Sure Independence Screening
arXiv:2411.01773v2  [stat.AP]  7 Nov 2024
(MrDc-SIS)?. For a comprehensive review and comparison of these robust screening techniques, Zhao and Fu? offers detailed
insights. Recently, Zhao et al.? utilized a model-free and distribution-free screening method, MrDcGene, on the TCGA-LUAD
dataset. This method effectively confirmed known biomarkers and identified new gene candidates associated with LUAD,
showcasing the potential of advanced sure screening methods in handling the intrinsic complexity of multi-omics data.
Building on recent advancements in dependence measures, we noted a new approach using the Wasserstein distance as a
dependence metric, as introduced in the work by Mordant and Segers?. The Wasserstein distance offers several advantages.
First, it remains stable under transformations like rotation and monotonic changes, making it robust in noisy, high-dimensional
data. Second, unlike some traditional measures, it does not rely on assumptions about linearity or Gaussian distributions, which
allows it to work effectively in model-free, distribution-free settings, making it a versatile choice for complex, mulit-omics
data. Finally, Wasserstein distance measures dependence by minimizing the “transport cost” between distributions, grounded in
optimal transport theory, providing a reliable and theoretically sound way to measure associations.
These properties make the Wasserstein distance particularly well-suited for high-dimensional, multi-omics datasets like
the TCGA-LUAD, where both complexity and noise are prevalent. In this paper, we aim to thoroughly test and compare
the performance of the Wasserstein distance against other feature selection methods through extensive simulation studies.
Following these simulations, we will apply the Wasserstein distance-based approach to the real TCGA-LUAD dataset, which
we downloaded through cBioPortal?, to evaluate its effectiveness in identifying meaningful gene associations for LUAD.

Comparative Analysis of Feature Selection Methods: Simulation Studies
In our comparison, we evaluate ten popular feature selection methods, including our Wasserstein distance-based screening
(WD-Screen). The other methods are as follows, for details, please refer to Zhao and Fu?
• Sure Independence Screening (SIS)? – uses Pearson correlation as the dependence measure between each predictor and
response variable.
• Sure Independence Ranking and Screening (SIRS)? – uses Pearson correlation between each predictor and the rank of
response variable.
• Robust Rank Correlation Screening (RRCS)? – uses Kendall’s τ as the dependence measure between each predictor and
the response variable.
• Distance Correlation based Sure Independence Screening (DC-SIS)? – uses distance correlation as the dependence
measure between each predictor and the response variable.
• Robust Distance Correlation Screening (DC-RoSIS)? – uses distance correlation between each predictor and the rank of
response variable.
• Multivariate Rank based Distance Correlation Screening (MrDc-SIS)? – uses distance correlation between the multivariate
rank of predictors and response variables.
• Stable Correlation based Screening (SC-SIS)? – uses a different weight function in the distance correlation as the
dependence measure between each predictor and response variable.
• Projection Correlation based Screening (PC-Screen)? – uses projection correlation as the dependence measure between
each predictor and response variable.
• Ball correlation based Screening (BCor-SIS)? – uses ball correlation as the dependence measure between each predictor
and response variable.
Study 1: Benchmarking and Validation of Feature Selection Methods
To establish a benchmark, allow comparison with prior studies, and verify the correctness of our implementation for each
method, we replicate a similar simulation setup as used in previous papers?,?,?. In this study, we generate data with n = 200
observations and p = 2000 predictors. The predictors Xn×p are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean
and AR (1) covariance structure, where the covariance matrix Σp×p = [σij]p×p, and σij = 0.5|i−j| for i, j = 1,2,..., p. The
response variable yn×1 is constructed by
y = β1X1 +β2X2 +β3X12 +β4X13 +ε,
2/7
where εn×1 is standard normal and β1,2,3,4 ∼Uniform(2,5).
We repeat the simulation 200 times and follow Li et al.?, we utilize three criteria to assess the performance of the feature
selection methods:
• S: The minimum model size to include all true predictors. We draw a box plot of S. The smaller the S, the better the
performance.
• Ps: The individual success rate of selecting a single true predictor within a predetermined cutoff across 200 replicates.
The larger the Ps, the better the performance.
• Pa: The success rate of selecting all true predictors within a predetermined cutoff across 200 replicates. The larger the
Pa, the better the performance.
We set the predetermined cutoff as [n/log(n)], where [a] stands for the integer part of a, to be consistent with Li et al.?.
For n = 200, the cutoff is s = [n/log(n)] = 37. Besides the 3 criteria above, we also create a box plot for the rank of each true
predictor. As a smaller rank indicates a more important predictor, ideally, the true predictors should be ranked at the top. This
visualization can further highlight each method’s effectiveness in identifying true predictors.
Figure 1. S in Study 1. The smaller the S, the better the
performance.
Figure 2. Rank of true predictors in Study 1. The smaller
the rank, the better the performance.
We can see all methods performed pretty well in this simple settings.

Study 2: Evaluating Performance with Non-Normal Predictor Distributions
In this study, we change the distribution of the predictors, Xi, to follow an i.i.d. power function distribution, which is the
inverse of the Pareto distribution with probability density function f(x;a) = axa−1 for 0 < x < 1 and a > 0. In our simulation,
we choose the parameter a = 5, A typical histogram of such distribution below illustrates how it more closely resembles
real-world data than the normal distribution used in Study 1. To further increase the difficulty of the test, the coefficients
β1,2,3,4 ∼Uni form(1,2), which is smaller than in Study 1. All other settings remain the same as in Study 1.
We can see if the predictors are from power distribution, the performance of all methods get worse. But still the WD-Screen
performs better than other methods.
Study 3: Simulating Multi-Omics and Multi-Endpoint Data Structures
To more closely simulate the structure of multi-omics data, we adapted a settings based on a TCGA-LUAD simulation from
Zhao et al.? In this study, we use again n = 200 observations, with p = 2000 predictor array and a q = 10-dimensional response

vector. Each predictor is represented as a 3-dimensional vector to mimic the multi-omics settings, where data are collected
across 3 different platforms (e.g. copy number variation, RNAseq, etc.). The 10-dimensional response vector, in turn, reflects
real-world situations where multiple clinical or biological endpoints are analyzed simultaneously.
The 3 platforms are generated as follows:
• Platform 1 (U = [U1,U2,...,Up]): Multivariate Pareto distributed with shape aU = 10 and mode mU = 1.
• Platform 2 (V = [V1,V2,...,Vp]): Multivariate Power distributed with parameter aV = 5.
• Platform 3 (W = [W1,W2,...,Wp]): Multivariate Power distributed with parameter aW = 5.
Each platform has a shared covariance structure Σp×p = [σij]p×p, where σij = 0.5|i−j|, and the predictor array X3×n×p =
[X1,X2,...,X p] is constructed by stacking these platforms: X j = [U j,V j,W j], ∀j = 1,2,..., p.
The response vector is connected with the predictors as follows:
• For k = 1,2,3
1. Randomly select indices id1,2,3,4 from {1,2,3} to represent the true platforms connected with the response.
2. Y k[i] = β1Xid1,i,2 + β2Xid2,i,3 + β3Xid3,i,101 + β4Xid4,i,102 + ε[i], ∀i = 1,2,...,n, where β1,2,3,4 ∼Uniform(1,2)
and ε ∼N(0,1).
• For k = 4,5,...,10, Y k ∼Power(5).
Since SIS, SIRS, RRCS, DC-RoSIS cannot handle multivariate response and predictors, we only compare the performance of
other 6 methods.
We can see clearly under this settings, PC-Screen, DC-SIS, and WD-Screen works constantly better than others.
Study 4: Assessing Feature Selection with Interaction Effects
In this study, we introduce an interaction term to simulate real-world scenarios where certain genes may not have an individual
effect on the disease, but may influence it in combination with others. Most settings remain the same as in Study 3, but the
active response for k = 1,2,3 is now
Y k[i] = β1Xid1,i,2 ×Xid2,i,3 +β2Xid3,i,101 ×Xid4,i,102 +ε[i],∀i = 1,2,...,n,
where β1,2 ∼Uni form(1,2) and ε ∼N(0,1).
We can see again PC-Screen, DC-SIS, and WD-Screen works better than other methods.

Feature Selection Methods on Real-World Data: A TCGA-LUAD Case Study
We obtained the TCGA-LUAD data from cBioPortal? and selected the nonsynonymous Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) from
clinical sample data as our response variable. TMB, particularly nonsynonymous TMB, is an important biomarker in cancer
research, measuring the total number of somatic nonsynonymous mutations per megabase in tumor cells, and it can vary widely
across and within cancer types. High TMB levels increase the production of neoantigens, which may be recognized by the
immune system, potentially enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Recently, studies have shown that TMB is associated
with clinical outcomes in multiple cancers, including melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Evidence
suggests that high TMB can effectively predict objective response rates and progression-free survival, making it a valuable
indicator in assessing immunotherapy outcomes.?,?.
In our study, we treat TMB as the response variable and seek to understand its association with genetic variations by
integrating data from multi-omics platforms. Specifically, we use data on copy number alteration (CNA), DNA methylation,
and mRNA expression as predictors. Each of these platforms provides unique insights: CNA data reflect gene amplification
or deletion, methylation data reveal epigenetic changes that may influence gene expression, and mRNA expression levels
indicate gene activity. By combining information from these platforms, we aim to identify genes whose variations correlate
strongly with TMB, uncovering potential drivers of mutational burden in LUAD. This multi-omics approach allows us to
explore complex, cross-platform interactions and their influence on TMB, which could ultimately inform targeted strategies for
immunotherapy in lung cancer.
From our simulation studies, we observe that PC-Screen, DC-SIS, and WD-Screen consistently outperform other feature
selection methods, showing reliable results across diverse scenarios. For the real data analysis, we apply these 3 methods to our
dataset, each offering a distinct approach and methodology to feature selection. Instead of using a traditional training-test split,
we adopt a more robust selection strategy which can use the full information of the real data: for each method, we select the top
[n/log(n)] features to form a selection set, then choose the intersection of the 3 selection sets as our final selection set. By
focusing on features that are independently identified by all 3 top-performing methods, we aim to enhance the robustness and
reliability of our final selection, ensuring that the chosen features are more likely to have genuine associations with TMB.
2-platform study
In our first study, we combine CNA and mRNA data, using the files “data_mrna_seq_v2_rsem_zscores_ref_all_samples.txt”
for mRNA and “data_cna.txt” for CNA. The original CNA data contains 230 subjects with 23423 genes, while the mRNA data
contains 230 subjects with 20466 genes. After removing the duplicates and genes missing from one platform, there are 18674
common genes across 230 subjects in these 2 platforms. Our predictor X will be a 2×230×18674 array, and our response Y
