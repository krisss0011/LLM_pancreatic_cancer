Abstract 
Recent advances in machine learning are transforming medical image analysis, particularly in cancer 
detection and classification. Techniques such as deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), are now enabling the precise analysis of complex histopathological 
images, automating detection, and enhancing classification accuracy across various cancer types. This study 
focuses on osteosarcoma (OS), the most common bone cancer in children and adolescents, which affects 
the long bones of the arms and legs. Early and accurate detection of OS is essential for improving patient 
outcomes and reducing mortality. However, the increasing prevalence of cancer and the demand for 
personalized treatments create challenges in achieving precise diagnoses and customized therapies. 
We propose a novel hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision 
transformers (ViT) to improve diagnostic accuracy for OS using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained 
histopathological images. The CNN model extracts local features, while the ViT captures global patterns 
from histopathological images. These features are combined and classified using a Multi-Layer Perceptron 
(MLP) into four categories: non-tumor (NT), non-viable tumor (NVT), viable tumor (VT), and none-viable 
ratio (NVR). Using the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 
99.08%, precision of 99.10%, recall of 99.28%, and an F1-score of 99.23%. This is the first successful four-
class classification using this dataset, setting a new benchmark in OS research and offering promising 
potential for future diagnostic advancements. 
Keywords: Osteosarcoma; vision transformer; histopathology; feature extraction. 
1. Introduction 
    Osteosarcoma is recognized as an aggressive form of bone cancer that commonly affects adolescents and 
children [1]. To determine the optimal treatment and assess the percentage of tumor necrosis, it is crucial 
to examine various histological regions [2]. However, traditional diagnostic methods, which rely heavily 
on manual examination of histopathological slides, are time-consuming, prone to observer bias, and often 
limited in diagnostic precision. Given the increasing prevalence of cancer and the demand for personalized 
treatments, there is an urgent need for automated, efficient, and accurate diagnostic tools [3]. Pathology

informatics, a rapidly expanding field within medical informatics, aims to extract valuable insights from 
medical pathology data. In recent years, digital pathology has experienced significant growth, with 
histopathological image analysis playing a vital role in the diagnosis and classification of OS [4]. Machine 
learning (ML) techniques, particularly deep learning (DL), have become increasingly prominent in 
histology image classification and segmentation [5]. ML methods, including neural networks, are proving 
to be highly effective in classifying and analyzing images of various cancers [6]. Several studies have 
focused on extracting a broad set of features, not all of which are necessarily relevant. For instance, Yu et 
al. [7] extracted over 9,000 features from images, covering aspects such as color, texture, object 
identification, granularity, and density. Irshad et al. [8] explored various image analysis techniques, 
including thresholding based on region growth, k-means clustering, and morphological features such as 
area and shape structures. Arunachalam et al. [9] introduced a method that utilized multi-level thresholding 
and shape segmentation to identify viable tumors, necrotic regions, and non-tumor areas in OS histology 
slides. Similarly, Malon et al. [10] trained a neural network to classify mitotic and non-mitotic cells based 
on morphological features like color, texture, and shape. However, many of these methods primarily 
emphasize nuclei segmentation rather than direct classification of tumor or non-tumor regions. 
    The advent of DL, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has significantly advanced 
computer vision and pattern recognition in histopathology [11]. CNNs have shown great promise in 
extracting key local features from images, including edges and textures. Studies by Litjens [12] and Spanhol 
et al. [13] demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs in breast image classification. CNNs typically extract 
features through convolutional layers and classify these features through fully connected layers. For 
instance, Su et al. [14]  used a fast-scanning CNN for breast cancer classification, while Spanhol et al. [13] 
extended the existing AlexNet architecture for various breast cancer segmentation tasks. Despite the success 
of CNNs, their reliance on local features limits their ability to capture global patterns in complex images 
such as histopathology slides of OS. 
    DL techniques have also been applied to OS classification using histological images in a few studies. 
Asmaria et al. [15] developed a CNN model to classify cell viability in H&E-stained OS datasets by 
employed data augmentation techniques to improve model performance. Sharma et al. [16] investigated 
various edge detection methods and evaluated the effectiveness of different feature sets, including 
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), using random forest and support vector machine (SVM) 
classifiers. Barzekar et al. [17] developed a new CNN structure (C-Net) specifically designed for classifying 
OS histological images. Hardie et al. [18] applied CNN models to detect OS, achieving an accuracy of 
90.36%. This research suggested exploring more advanced DL architectures, such as Xception, to enhance 
diagnostic accuracy.  
    However, the studies also showed some limitations. For example, in Asmaria et al. [15], the classification 
of osteosarcoma histological images involved a segmentation step, where regions of interest were isolated 
before the deep learning model could be applied. This segmentation step adds complexity, increasing 
computational time and slowing down the overall process. Additionally, it risks losing critical global 
context by focusing only on specific regions, potentially leading to incomplete classifications, particularly 
when tumor heterogeneity plays a role. Moreover, segmentation often requires manual intervention, which 
introduces the possibility of human error and bias, especially when tumor boundaries are ambiguous. 
Similarly, Sharma et al. [16] relied heavily on edge detection and segmentation techniques that may 
overlook subtler image features necessary for accurate classification. While effective for extracting well-
defined structures, these methods may miss less obvious characteristics within the tumor tissue, reducing 
the model’s ability to fully capture the complexity of the histological images. 
Page 3 of 21 
 
Barzekar et al. [17] and Hardie et al. [18] also faced challenges with segmentation-based approaches. 
Although they achieved reasonable accuracy, their reliance on manually segmented data could lead to 
inconsistent results and increased variability due to human interpretation. Furthermore, segmentation can 
miss critical global features that contribute to tumor classification, especially in heterogeneous tumors, 
where subtle patterns or transitions across tissue regions are essential for an accurate diagnosis. Recent 
studies have also compared various DL models and hybrid approaches for cancer diagnosis. Vezakis et al. 
[19] compared various deep learning models for osteosarcoma diagnosis from histopathological images, 
finding that smaller models like MobileNetV2 outperform larger ones due to better generalization on 
limited data. This finds the importance of model selection to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in 
medical imaging. Astaraki et al. [20] compared radiomics and DL approaches for predicting malignancy in 
lung nodules, concluding that hybrid models combining traditional radiomics and DL methods yielded the 
best diagnostic results. Additionally, Wang et al. [21] developed an hybrid AI-based tool, OS Histological 
Imaging Classifier (OSHIC), which uses digital pathology to predict OS recurrence and survival based on 
nuclear morphological features. To further improve medical image segmentation while preserving spatial 
information, Erickson et al. [22] introduced a novel DL architecture called INet, which CNNs with attention 
mechanisms, forming a hybrid model that integrates feature extraction and selective focus on important 
image regions. This hybrid approach enhanced the model's ability to accurately classify medical images by 
blending the strengths of both CNNs and attention-based networks, making it particularly effective for 
complex medical datasets. The hybrid models have the advantage of leveraging CNNs' ability to capture 
fine-grained local features and attention mechanisms’ capacity to model long-range dependencies and 
global patterns within images. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the image, making 
hybrid models especially suited for tasks requiring both detailed and broad image analysis, which is why 
we applied this approach in our work. 
This paper introduces a new hybrid DL method for classifying tumor types in OS (non-tumor (NT), non-
viable tumor (NVT), viable tumor (VT), and none-viable ratio (NVR)) using H&E-stained 
histopathological images of OS sourced from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The proposed hybrid 
approach combines CNN, Vision Transformer (ViT), and multi-layer perception (MLP) models applied 
directly to histological images without a segmentation step, capturing both local and global image features.  
2. Methodology 
 
General experimental design 
    In this study, different DL techniques including ResNet, ViT, CNN, and a hybrid CNN-ViT architecture 
are used for classifying OS histopathological images. These models utilize both local and global feature 
extraction techniques to accurately classify OS tissues, and the hybrid model combines the strengths of 
CNNs for capturing local patterns and ViTs for modeling global context. Through this approach, we aim to 
establish an efficient and accurate system for histopathological image classification in OS that enhances 
diagnostic capabilities in cancer research. We have divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets 
for all the models. We used the training set, comprising 60% of the data, to update the model's weights, and 
used the validation set, accounting for 15% of the data, to provide feedback on the model's generalization 
during training. We reserved the remaining 25% of the data for testing the final model. We have conducted 
all the research methods in a Google Colab environment using a Tesla T4 GPU and an Intel (R) Core (TM) 
i7-4790K CPU running at 4.00 GHz with 16 GB of RAM.

2.1.  The dataset description 
   In this study, we have used an open-source osteosarcoma histology image dataset from the Cancer 
Imaging 
Archive 
(TCIA) 
https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/osteosarcoma-tumor-
assessment/, compiled by clinical scientists at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at 
Children's Medical Center in Dallas from 1995 to 2015. For research purposes, the dataset, which is publicly 
available on the TCIA website, consists of 1144 histopathological images in JPG format. We categorize the 
images into four classes: 1. non-tumor (NT), 2. non-viable tumor (NVT), 3. viable tumor (VT), and non-
viable ratio (NVR). The NT category is the largest, with 536 images showing normal bone tissue, blood 
vessels, and cartilage. The categories of NVT, VT, and NVR are smaller, with 263, 292, and 53 images, 
respectively. Figure 1 presents sample images from each of the four categories.

Figure 1. Four samples from the dataset: (1) NT, (2) NVT, (3) NVR, and (4) VT 
The definitions of all these categories are explained below: 
Non-Tumor: Non-Tumor (NT) refers to tissue that remains unaffected by cancer. This could be 
surrounding healthy tissues such as muscles, bones, or organs near the tumor site, but these are not part of 
the cancerous mass. 
Non-Viable Tumor: The term non-viable tumor (NVT) tissue refers to dead or necrotic tumor cells. This 
tissue is no longer living or functional, often due to previous treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation, 
or spontaneous cell death. Non-viable tumor tissue does not have the capability to grow or spread. 
Viable Tumor: Viable tumor (VT) tissue consists of living, active cancer cells that are capable of growth 
and division. This tissue poses a significant risk due to its potential to proliferate and metastasize to other 
parts of the body. 
Non-Viable Ratio: The Non-viable ratio (NVR) describes the proportion of living tumor cells to dead 
tumor cells in a specific area. A lower viable-to-non-viable ratio indicates that treatment has successfully 
killed more of the tumor, whereas a higher ratio indicates that a significant portion of the tumor remains 
active and potentially dangerous. 
2.2. Image pre-processing 
The TCGA images (Section 2.1), were resized to 128×128 for model processing. The dataset is imbalanced, 
with the NT class having the most samples (536 images) and the NVR class having the fewest (53 images). 
To address this imbalance, we have applied class weighting during training to ensure that the model pays 
adequate attention to the minority classes. Moreover, we have normalized them using the mean and standard 
deviation values.

2.3. ResNet 
   ResNet50 is a 50-layer DL model that uses residual connections to train deep networks [23]. These 
residual connections solve the problem of vanishing gradients, which commonly affect deep networks by 
allowing information to skip layers during the forward and backward pass. This allows deeper networks 
like ResNet50 to learn effectively, even with many layers, without degrading the model’s performance. 
ResNet50 divides its architecture into several stages, each containing a series of convolutional layers, batch 
normalization, activation functions (typically ReLU), and residual connections. The network extracts 
hierarchical features from images, starting with low-level features like edges and textures and progressing 
to more complex features representing the structure and patterns within the images. By leveraging the pre-
trained ImageNet weights and fine-tuning the final fully connected layer, we can adapt this deep network 
to our specific classification task. The combination of careful hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, 
and monitoring through Tensor Board resulted in a model that achieved high accuracy and generalization. 
This approach underscores the potency of transfer learning in medical image analysis, enabling the 
adaptation of pre-trained deep networks to address domain-specific issues with minimal alteration and 
outstanding outcomes. 
In Table 1, we have shown the architecture of ResNet50, including the layer type, input/output shapes, 
operations, and purpose at each stage of the network. This table specifically corresponds to the ResNet50 
architecture, which is adapted for four-class classification in our study.

2.4. ViT model 
   The use of a ViT model for histopathological image classification represents a novel and effective 
approach in medical imaging analysis [24]. In this context, the ViT model processes input images by 
dividing them into non-overlapping patches, embedding these patches into vectors, and feeding the 
embedding into a series of transformer blocks. The architecture of the ViT model is based on self-attention 
mechanisms [25] that allows the model to focus on different parts of the image simultaneously, capturing 
dependencies between distant regions of the image. This is particularly important in medical imaging tasks, 
where subtle features distributed across the image may be critical to accurate classification. The ViT model 
can learn both local and global relationships by using multi-head self-attention layers to process the whole 
image context [26]. To adapt the ViT model for this specific classification task, the pre-trained classification 
head, originally designed for 1,000 ImageNet classes, was replaced with a custom head tailored for the 
four-class output, i.e. including NT, NVT, VT, and NVR. The modified classification layer uses a fully 
connected layer that outputs four probabilities, corresponding to the likelihood that the input image belongs 
to each class. We have connected the modified head layer to the ViT's transformer blocks for this task, 
enabling the model to generate predictions tailored to the histopathological data. 
    We have used a batch size of 32 images during training to balance computational efficiency with the 
ability to capture meaningful gradients during optimization. The training was conducted over twenty 
epochs, based on observed convergence behavior and available computational resources. We used cross-
entropy loss as the loss function, measuring the difference between predicted class probabilities and true 
labels. The Adam optimizer was employed with parameters β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.999, which helped to 
stabilize the training. The optimizer, using backpropagation, adjusted the model’s weights to minimize this 
Page 8 of 21 
 
loss. We evaluated the model's validation loss and accuracy at the end of each epoch, saving the model with 
the lowest validation loss as the best-performing model. This early stopping mechanism ensured that the 
model would not overfit the training data and would generalize well to unseen data. After completing the 
model training, we evaluated the final model on the test dataset to gauge its performance on unseen images. 
We computed standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. These 
metrics provided a comprehensive understanding of the model’s classification performance, not only in 
terms of overall accuracy but also in its ability to correctly identify each class. 
In Table 2, we have shown the architecture of the ViT model used in this paper for four classification of OS 
patients.

2.5. CNN 
   Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a powerful class of DL models [27] specifically designed for 
tasks involving image data [28]. In the case of histopathological image classification, CNNs offer a robust 
mechanism for automatically extracting and learning important features from the raw image data, such as 
textures, edges, and patterns [29]. These features are crucial for distinguishing between different types of 
tumor cells in medical images. Below, we explain the details of the CNN model used in this work, followed 
by its advantages and limitations. In this paper, we have implemented the CNN architecture to classify 
histopathological images into four distinct categories: NT, NVT, VT, and NVR.  
The architecture starts with three blocks of convolutional layers. The first block contains two convolutional 
layers, each with 64 filters and a kernel size of (3, 3). LeakyReLU activation functions with an alpha value 
of 0.25 follow the convolutional layers, which allows a small gradient for negative inputs, preventing 
neurons from "dying" and improving the robustness of the model. This block ends with a MaxPooling2D 
layer that reduces the spatial size of the feature maps, focusing on the most important features while 
reducing computational complexity. The second block follows the same pattern, but with two convolutional 
layers using 128 filters, further enhancing the model’s ability to capture more abstract features from the 
image data. The third convolutional block increases the number of filters to 256, helping the model learn 
even more detailed and complex features from the images. We used a learning rate of 10−4, determined 
through hyperparameter tuning, and the Adam optimizer for faster convergence and better adaptability 
during training. We then applied the GlobalAveragePooling2D layer, which reduces each feature map to a 
single value by taking the average across spatial dimensions. This technique reduces the number of 
parameters, making the fully connected layers more efficient and less prone to overfitting. The final layers 
consist of two fully connected (dense) layers with 1024 units each, both followed by LeakyReLU 
activations. The final layer in the network—a dense output layer with four units—represents the four output 
classes. It employs a SoftMax activation function to transform the raw output scores into probabilities, 
guaranteeing that the predicted class aligns with the highest probability. For training, we used a batch size 
of 32 and 30 epochs, which allowed the model to effectively classify histopathological images into four 
categories. We optimized the model's hyperparameters using the grid search method to balance extraction, 
computational efficiency, and generalization while addressing challenges like overfitting and 
computational costs. 
2.6. CNN+ViT model (a hybrid model) 
    In this model, we have concatenated the features extracted from the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT) 
into a single feature vector before passing them to the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a well-known 
classifier [30] for classification. This process is crucial for integrating local features (captured by CNN) 
and global features (captured by ViT) into a unified representation, allowing the model to leverage both 
types of information for improved classification accuracy. 
2.6.1. Extracting Features from CNN and ViT 
CNN Features: After passing the input image through CNN, we obtain a feature vector of size 1024. The 
CNN uses a learning rate of 10−4 , Adam optimizer, batch size of 32, and trains for 30 epochs, ensuring 
optimal local feature extraction. 
ViT Features: Similarly, after processing the same input image through ViT, we extract a much larger 
feature vector of size 150,528. The ViT model uses Adam optimizer with parameters β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 
0.999, a batch size of 32, and trains for 30 epochs, allowing it to capture global patterns effectively. 
Page 11 of 21 
 
2.6.2. Concatenation of Features 
Once we have both sets of features, we concatenate them into a single, unified feature vector of size 
151,552. This concatenation combines the local and global features from CNN and ViT respectively. 
The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), with its fully connected layers, receives the concatenated 151,552-
dimensional feature vector. The MLP processes this combined feature vector to classify the image into one 
of the four categories: NT, NVT, VT, and NVR. The MLP applies transformations to the vector using 
hidden layers and LeakyReLU activation functions with early stopping and evaluates the performance based 
on validation loss to prevent overfitting. Combining the detailed CNN features with the global ViT features 
can improve the model's classification accuracy by leveraging the strengths of both architectures.

3. Results and comparative study 
    In this study, we have evaluated the performance of four DL models—CNN, ViT, ResNet, and a hybrid 
model—for the classification of OS histopathological images. We have applied these models to datasets for 
two-class (the results are shown in Table 4), three-class (the results are shown in Table 5), and four-class 
classification tasks (the results are shown in Table 6). We have assessed each model's performance using 
key evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (Table 3). 
The CNN model showed decent performance, especially in two-class and three-class tasks. Specifically, 
for two-class classification, CNN achieved 82% test accuracy and 86% validation accuracy, demonstrating 
its capacity for binary classification tasks. It showed improvement in the three-class task, with 89% test 
accuracy and 90% validation accuracy. However, as the classification problem became more complex in 
the four-class task, CNN’s performance dropped to 81% test accuracy and 88% validation accuracy.  
    On the other hand, ViT model uses its self-attention mechanism to capture global patterns, enabling it to 
model relationships between distant image regions. We observed that the ViT model consistently 
outperformed CNN in all tasks. For two-class classification, the ViT achieved 93% test accuracy and 94% 
validation accuracy, significantly better than the CNN. It also performed well in the three-class task, with 
95% test accuracy and 93% validation accuracy. In the four-class task, ViT outperformed CNN again with 
89% test accuracy and 88% validation accuracy (Table 2).  
    ResNet also performed well in these tasks. The two-class classification results showed 87% test accuracy 
and 92% validation accuracy, which is better than CNN but slightly below ViT. For the three-class task, 
ResNet achieved 87% test accuracy and 92% validation accuracy. However, in the four-class task, ResNet 
managed 87% test accuracy and 92% validation accuracy, reflecting a stable but less impressive 
performance compared to ViT (Table 3).

Among the tested models, the CNN + ViT hybrid model demonstrated the best performance across all tasks. 
In the two-class task, it achieved 93.67% test accuracy and 91.60% validation accuracy, outperforming both 
standalone CNN and ViT models. In the three-class task, the hybrid model was especially impressive, 
achieving a near-perfect 99.56% test accuracy and 99.91% validation accuracy, which sets a new 
benchmark for this task. For the four-class classification, which is the most challenging task, the hybrid 
model again outperformed all others, with 99.08% test accuracy and 99.70% validation accuracy.

3.1. Discussion 
    In this study, we developed a hybrid DL model that combines CNN and ViT to classify OS 
histopathological images into four distinct categories: NT, NVT, VT, and NVR. Our approach introduced 
several advantages over previous methods, improving classification accuracy and reducing computational 
complexity. 
    First, we achieved a higher accuracy (93.67%) in distinguishing VT from NT groups, surpassing previous 
studies that used the same dataset. For example, Mishra et al.  [32] employed a custom CNN model, 
achieving an accuracy of 84% in binary classification between VT and NT. Similarly, another study [9] that 
used segmentation techniques reported a testing accuracy of 86% for the same task. Our model exceeded 
this benchmark, confirming the strength of the CNN + ViT hybrid architecture in effectively capturing both 
local and global image features with no segmentation step required. 
    Second, for the three-class classification (VT, NVT, NT), our model demonstrated an accuracy of 99.56% 
and a recall measure of 99.9% while reducing computational complexity. Prior research, such as that by 
Ahmed et al. [33], utilized two CNN models to classify three tumor types, achieving an accuracy of 86%. 
Fakieh et al. [34] improved upon this with a Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) and Deep Stacked Sparse 
Autoencoder (DSSAE) model, reaching an average accuracy of 99.71%. Moreover, Vaiyapuri et al. [35] 
developed a model incorporating the Honey Badger Optimization (HBO) algorithm and achieved an 
accuracy of 99.71%, with a high F1-score of 99.62%. Although these methods achieved high accuracy, they 
involved optimization techniques which increased computational demands. Our model, in contrast, 
maintained similar levels of accuracy but with reduced reliance on complex optimization methods, offering 
greater efficiency.

Furthermore, our work is the first to classify all four classes of OS (NT, NVT, VT, and NVR) using the 
TCGA dataset, setting a new benchmark for OS classification. We have achieved an accuracy of 99.08% in 
four-class classification.  
    Previous research primarily focused on binary or three-class classification, overlooking the critical NVR 
category. For instance, Mishra et al. [36] achieved an accuracy of 92.4% in three-class classification (VT, 
NVT, NT), but no prior studies had expanded to four-class classification. The non-viable ratio (NVR) 
category is crucial in osteosarcoma classification because it helps evaluate the effectiveness of treatment, 
particularly chemotherapy. A higher NVR, indicating a larger proportion of necrotic (non-viable) tissue 
compared to viable tumor areas, often correlates with a positive response to therapy and better patient 
outcomes. The NVR serves as a valuable prognostic tool, aiding clinicians in assessing tumor regression 
and adjusting treatment plans accordingly. Additionally, including the NVR in classifications offers a more 
comprehensive view of tumor heterogeneity. 
    Previous studies have often excluded the NVR category due to the complexity of accurately identifying 
and segmenting non-viable tissue in histopathological images. Traditional classification models focused 
primarily on simpler distinctions, such as viable versus non-viable tumor, which were more straightforward 
to define. Challenges like the lack of labeled data, segmentation difficulties, and the tendency to focus on 
clinically easier classifications limited the incorporation of NVR into earlier models. By addressing this 
gap in the research, our study's inclusion of the NVR category sets a new benchmark, offering more detailed 
insights into treatment outcomes and improving the accuracy of osteosarcoma classifications.  
    However, we observed that CNN’s classification performance dropped in the four-class task. This 
suggests that while CNN excels at detecting local patterns, it struggles with tasks like specific image 
classification or segmentation activities that demand the model recognize and interpret larger, more 
complex relationships or structures within the image. This requires the model to understand broader, more 
complex image structures. We also observed that ResNet performance was lower than ViT for the four-class 
classification task. We think the reason is that ResNet can deal with problems like vanishing gradients due 
to its residual connections, but it still uses convolutional layers for feature extraction, which cannot model 
global information as well as ViT. The CNN + ViT hybrid model demonstrated the best performance among 
all models used for all classification tasks. These results clearly highlight the strength of combining the 
local feature extraction abilities of CNN with the global feature understanding capabilities of ViT.

4. Conclusion 
    The proposed hybrid AI model demonstrated significant improvements in accurately identifying critical 
features in OS images by merging the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the global feature 
recognition strengths of ViTs.  
    This hybrid architecture outperformed traditional models, such as ResNet, by effectively leveraging both 
local and global features. The success of this model demonstrates the potential of combining these two 
approaches to advance medical imaging and improve personalized cancer treatment. Our results show that 
this hybrid method can significantly enhance diagnostic precision, streamline decision-making, and 
improve patient outcomes for diagnosis of OS patients. 
    Future research could focus on optimizing the model to reduce its computational demands, incorporating 
cancer-specific pre-training, and applying it to other cancer types. Testing this method in real-world clinical 
settings will be essential to assess its practicality and robustness for use in diagnosis and treatment planning.
