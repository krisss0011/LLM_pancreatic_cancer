Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge due to its increasing preva-
lence, particularly among younger populations, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed
cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite
instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise 15% of all
CRC, and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors.
Despite this, there is still a significant need to optimise immunotherapeutic regimens to max-
imise clinical efficacy and patient quality of life, whilst minimising monetary costs. Mathematical
models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential
equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints,
damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We provide deterministic equa-
tions for the concentrations of cancer cells, DAMPs, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells
(DCs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells and various cy-
tokines of pro-inflammatory (IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF, IL-12, IL-1β) and immunosuppressive (TGF-β,
IL-10, IL-4, IL-6) nature. We consider these cells and their phenotypes, noting that many of
these cell types are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way
for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two com-
partments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account
phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab,
and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for
the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioan-
alytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from
the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pem-
brolizumab — one of the most commonly used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy
and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and
improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC.
We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for effective
tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide accounting for approximately
10% of all cancer cases [1] with more than 1.85 million cases and 850,000 deaths annually [2]. The
American Cancer Society estimates that in the United States, there will be 152,810 new cases of CRC
diagnosed and 53,010 deaths due to CRC [3] with individual risk factors including a family history
of CRC, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 2 diabetes [4]. Despite CRC being diagnosed mostly
in adults 65 and older, there has been an increase in the incidence rate of CRC amongst younger
populations [3, 5, 6] since the mid-1990s, with CRC being the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in
adults under 55 [3]. In particular, since many people will not experience symptoms in the early stages
of CRC, diagnoses often occur at a later stage when the disease is more advanced, where treatment
is significantly less effective, and survival is much worse [7]. Of new CRC diagnoses, 20% of patients
present with metastatic disease, while an additional 25% who initially have localised disease eventually
develop metastases [2]. In the United States, the 5-year survival rates for stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and
Stage IIIC colon cancer are 90%, 72%, and 53% respectively, whilst stage IV CRC has a 5-year survival
of only 12% [8].
Whilst many systemic therapies are available for advanced CRC, chemotherapy has been the main
treatment approach with fluoropyrimidine 5-fluorouracil being the only Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) agent approved for metastatic CRC treatment for nearly 40 years [9]. Noting that folinic
acid (leucovorin), a vitamin B derivative, increases the cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil [10], and with
the approval of the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan in 1996 and the platinum-based agent oxali-
platin, mainstay chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin) and
FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan) have become integral to the treatment of advanced
CRC [11]. However, the response rate of advanced CRC patients with 5-fluorouracil monotherapy
remains at only 10 – 15%, with the addition of other anti-cancer drugs increasing response rates to
only 40 – 50% [12].
Moreover, patients with the hypermutant microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) phenotype who have
reached metastasis are less responsive to conventional chemotherapy and have a poorer prognosis
compared to patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC [13]. MSI-H CRC is associated with the
inactivation of mismatch repair (MMR) genes, including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, leading to
deficient MMR (dMMR) and impaired recognition and correction of spontaneous mutations by cells
[14]. In particular, we note that in CRC, MSI-H and dMMR tumours are equivalent [15], and we
denote these tumours as MSI-H/dMMR for the remainder of this work. Approximately 20% of stage
II, 12% of stage III, and 4% of stage IV CRC tumours are diagnosed as MSI-H/dMMR [16, 17], with
approximately 80% of sporadic MSI-H/dMMR CRC caused by MLH1 promoter hypermethylation
[18]. This leads to a highly increased mutational rate, with MSI-H/dMMR CRC tumours having 10
– 100 times more somatic tumours compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC tumours [14], re-
sulting in increased tumour mutation burden (TMB) and neoantigen load, and immunogenic tumour
microenvironment (TME) with dense immune cell infiltration [19, 20]. This immunogenicity results in
patients with MSI-H/dMMR CRC having good prognosis for immunotherapy treatment, in particular
to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) [21].
Immune checkpoints, such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) normally downregulate immune re-
sponses after antigen activation [22]. CTLA-4 is expressed on activated T and B cells and plays a
major role in downmodulating the initial stages of T cell activation and proliferation [23]. PD-1, a cell
2
membrane receptor that is expressed on a variety of cell types including activated T cells, activated B
cells and monocytes, has been extensively researched in the context of cancer such as MSI-H/dMMR
CRC [24, 25]. When PD-1 interacts with its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2), effector T cell activity
is inhibited, resulting in downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and upregulation of
immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) [26, 27]. Cancers can exploit this by expressing PD-L1
themselves, evading immunosurveillance, and impairing the proliferation and activity of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTLs) [28]. Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 complex formation reinvigorates effector T cell
activity, resulting in enhanced anti-tumour immunity and responses, leading to improved clinical out-
comes in cancer patients [29, 30].
The KEYNOTE-177 phase III trial, NCT02563002, aimed to evaluate the efficacy of first-line pem-
brolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC [18]. In the trial, 307 treatment-
naive metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab at
a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or 5–fluorouracil–based chemotherapy every 2 weeks. A partial or
complete response was observed in 43.8% of patients allocated to pembrolizumab therapy, compared
with 33.1% of patients participating in 5-fluorouracil-based therapy. Furthermore, among patients who
responded, 83% in the pembrolizumab group maintained response at 24 months, compared with 35%
of patients receiving chemotherapy. These results motivated the FDA to approve pembrolizumab for
the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC on June 29, 2020 [31].
In the past couple of years, there has been a surge in research into the efficacy of neoadjuvant pem-
brolizumab in the treatment of high-risk stage II and stage III MSI-H/dMMR CRC. One such phase
II study is the NEOPRISM-CRC, NCT05197322, 31 patients with a high TMR and high-risk stage II
or stage III MSI-H/dMMR CRC were given 3 cycles of pembrolizumab, at a dose of 200mg every 3
weeks via IV infusion, and underwent surgery 4 – 6 weeks after the last dose was administered [32].
Seventeen patients exhibited pathologic complete responses (pCRs) (55%, 95% CI 36% – 73%), with
the remaining patients having their tumours removed after surgery. After a median follow-up time of
6 months, recurrence was found in no patients, and the median cancer-free period was 9.7 months.
Another phase II trial, NCT04082572, aimed to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab
on localised MSI-H/dMMR solid tumours [33]. As part of this, 27 MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients with
locally advanced cancer were either given 200 mg pembrolizumab via IV infusion every 3 weeks for
eight treatments followed by surgical resection, or 200 mg pembrolizumab via IV infusion every 3 weeks
for 16 treatments. Of the 14 MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients who chose the resection approach, 11 of
these had pCRs, and overall, 21 MSI-H/dMMR patients exhibited pcR. Additionally, after a median
follow-up time of 9.5 months, only 2 patients who underwent surgical resection experienced recurrence
or progression.
An important question to consider is the appropriate dosing and spacing of ICI therapies, to balance
tumour reduction with factors such as monetary cost, toxicity, and side effects [34, 35]. A retrospec-
tive study by Dubé-Pelletier et al. of 80 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
who received 4 mg/kg pembrolizumab every 6 weeks and 80 NSCLC patients who received 2 mg/kg
pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, revealed that both therapies were comparable in terms of OS, toxicity
and progression-free survival [36], despite the less frequent therapy being more cost-effective. Various
pharmacokinetic models have been developed to optimise ICI therapy [37–40], with [41] showing that
tripling the dosing interval of nivolumab, another anti-PD-1 antibody, from 240mg every 2 weeks to
240mg every 6 weeks leads to comparable efficacy despite financial costs decreasing threefold. Math-
ematical models provide a powerful framework for optimising treatment regimens, and in this work,
3
we construct a comprehensive data-driven model of the immunobiology of MSI-H/dMMR CRC using
delay integro-differential equations and use this to evaluate and optimise neoadjuvant pembrolizumab
therapy in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC.
To date, there are no existing mathematical models in the literature for ICI therapy in locally ad-
vanced CRC; however, there are numerous models of CRC. Kirshtein et al. developed an ordinary
differential equation (ODE) model of CRC progression incorporating immunological components such
as T helper cells, Tregs, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, as well as considered the effects of carcino-
genic cytokines and immunosuppressive agents [42]. They used data from the TCGA COADREAD
database [43] to perform estimates for the steady states and initial conditions of model variables, and
considered data from all patients, regardless of TNM stage. Moreover, this model was extended in
[44] to include FOLFIRI treatment. Bozkurt et al. presented a relatively simple ODE model of CRC
treatment with anthracycline doxorubicin, and IL-2 immunotherapy, modelling cancer cells, natural
killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, and other lymphocytes [45]. dePillis et al. developed an ODE model of
CRC with irinotecan and monoclonal antibody therapies, in particular cetuximab and panitumumab,
modelling similar quantities [46].
ICI therapy has been modelled extensively in other cancers, and [47] provides a comprehensive review
on the merits and weaknesses of various modelling approaches including continuum partial differential
equations (PDEs), continuum ODEs, agent-based modelling (ABM) and hybrid modelling. We now
summarise a few pre-existing differential-equation-based models of PD-1 blockade therapies. Lai et
al. modelled the effects of anti-PD-1 and vaccines on cancer, taking into account DC maturation
by high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in [48].
This model was adapted in [49] to optimise combination PD-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) inhibitor therapies in cancer. Siewe et al. modelled how transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-β) can be used to overcome resistance to PD-1 blockade and also incorporated macrophages,
Tregs, IL-2, IL-12, TGF-β, interleukin-10 (IL-10), and chemokine ligand 2 (CCL-2) [50]. This model
was extended in [51] to model cancer therapy with PD-1 inhibitors with CSF-1 blockade, also including
the cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Additionally, Liao et al. constructed a mathematical model
that demonstrated the pro-cancer or anti-cancer nature of interleukin-27 (IL-27) in combination with
anti-PD-1, incorporating the following cytokines: IL-27, TGF-β, IL-2, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and
IL-10 [52].
There are, however, a multitude of limitations and drawbacks to these pre-existing models of CRC
and ICI therapy. One of the biggest issues is that mature DC migration to the tumour-draining lymph
node (TDLN) to activate naive T cells is not addressed, with T cell proliferation and migration to the
tumour site (TS) also not being addressed. Kumbhari et al. attempted to address this in [53] and
[54] in the context of optimising cancer vaccine therapy; however, activation is treated as occurring
instantaneously which has been shown to be false experimentally [55]. Moreover, since T cell activation
and proliferation take a non-negligible amount of time to occur, immune checkpoint inhibition of these
processes must take this into account. No papers to date have properly considered this inhibition de-
terministically throughout the whole proliferation and activation programs, since examining inhibition
at a single moment in time is insufficient to characterise this properly. Additionally, damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs), released by necrotic cancer cells, induce DC maturation. To date, DC
maturation is considered only by HMGB1 in some models, with other important DAMPs such as
calreticulin and extracellular ATP not being taken into account [56]. Furthermore, no deterministic
model to date has adequately addressed CD8+ T cell exhaustion due to prolonged antigen exposure
[57], nor their potential reinvigoration through immune checkpoint blockade.

Many immune cell types and cytokines that are prevalent and have important roles in the TME
have not been incorporated in pre-existing deterministic models of cancer. These include neutrophils,
which can either enhance anti-tumour immunity or reduce pro-tumour inflammation [58, 59], cancer-
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) which are the most abundant component of the TME and produce
immunosuppressive cytokines [60, 61], and cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6)
and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) [62]. One thing to note is that pre-existing deterministic models mostly
estimate cytokine production parameters via biologically informed assumptions, which can lead to
inaccuracies and is a somewhat ad hoc approach. In this work we construct a mathematical model
using data-driven delay integro-differential equations that addresses these drawbacks, incorporating
all of the aforementioned processes and species, and use this to optimise neoadjuvant pembrolizumab
therapy in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC.
It is prudent for us to briefly outline the functions and processes of some immune cells in the TME
since their interaction with cancer cells directly or through chemokine/cytokine signalling significantly
influences the efficacy of therapeutic regimens [63]. T cell activation occurs in the lymph node and
occurs through T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of cancer antigen presented by major histocompat-
ibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, in the case of CD8+ T cells, and MHC class II molecules,
in the case of CD4+ T cells, expressed on the surfaces of mature DCs [64]. CTLs recognise cancer
cells through TCR detection of peptide major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) on cancer cell
surfaces via MHC class I [65]. CD8+ cells, as well as NK cells, are amongst the most cytotoxic and im-
portant cells in cancer cell lysis [66], in addition to secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2,
IFN-γ, and TNF [67]. These are also secreted by CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and are an important
part of cell-mediated immunity, allowing for neutrophil chemotaxis and macrophage activation [68].
On the other hand, CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells produce various anti-inflammatory cytokines such
as IL-4, IL-10, and interleukin 23 (IL-23), which induce increased antibody production, and eosinophil
activation [69].
Furthermore, we must also consider CD4+ Tregs, which are vital in immune tis-
sue homeostasis, since they are able to suppress the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and
control intestinal inflammatory processes [70]. This is done in a variety of ways, including the produc-
tion of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive cytokines such as TGF-β, IL-10, and interleukin
35 (IL-35) [71, 72]. We note that naive CD4+ T cells can differentiate towards multiple additional
phenotypes such as Th9, Th22, Tfh and Th17 cells, each involved in the pathogenesis of cancer [73, 74].
Also of importance in CRC are macrophages which, like T cells, are able to produce pro-inflammatory
and anti-inflammatory cytokines [75]. Naive macrophages, denoted M0 macrophages, can differen-
tiate into two main phenotypes: classically activated M1 macrophages and alternatively activated
M2 macrophages. These names were given since M1 macrophages promote Th1 cell responses, and
M2 macrophages promote Th2 responses, with Th1-associated cytokines downregulating M2 activ-
ity, and vice-versa [76]. M1 macrophages contribute to the inflammatory response by activating en-
dothelial cells, promoting the induction of nitric oxide synthase, and producing large amounts of
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β, and IL-12 [77]. On the other hand, M2 macrophages
are responsible for wound healing and the resolution of inflammation, through phagocytosing apop-
totic cells, and releasing anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10, interleukin 13α1 (IL-13α1), and
CC Motif Chemokine Ligand 17 (CCL17) [78].
Finally, we consider neutrophils in CRC which promote tumour growth, invasion, and metastasis
[79], but like macrophages and T cells, secrete pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines
[80]. Similarly to macrophages, naive neutrophils, denoted N0 neutrophils, can differentiate into two
5
main phenotypes: anti-tumour N1 neutrophils and pro-tumour N2 neutrophils [81]. N1 neutrophils
in CRC are characterised by their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-12, and
IL-1β [82]. However, N2 neutrophils promote tumour growth and metastasis through the secretion
of pro-angiogenic factors and immunosuppressive chemokines such as arginase, CCL2 and chemokine
ligand 4 (CCL4) [81, 83].
It is important to note that the M1/M2 macrophage and N1/N2 and neutrophil dichotomies are some-
what of a simplification. Macrophages and neutrophils are highly plastic and have been demonstrated
to integrate environmental signals to change their phenotype and physiology [84, 85]. To account for
this, in the model, we incorporate macrophage and neutrophil polarisation and repolarisation between
their anti-tumour and immunosuppressive phenotypes by various cytokines and proteins.

Mathematical Model
2.1
Model Assumptions
The variables and their units in the model are shown in Table 1. For simplicity, we ignore spatial effects
in the model, ignoring the effects of diffusion, advection, and chemotaxis by all species. We assume the
system has two compartments: one at the TS, located in the colon or rectum, and one at the tumour-
draining lymph node (TDLN). We assume that cytokines in the TS are produced only by effector or
activated cells and that DAMPs in the TS are only produced by necrotic cancer cells. We assume that
all mature DCs in the TDLN are cancer-antigen bearing and that all T cells in the TS are primed with
cancer antigens. Furthermore, we assume that all activated T cells in the TDLN are activated with
cancer antigens and that T cell proliferation/division follows a deterministic program. We assume that
CD4+ T cells, immediately upon activation, differentiate into the Th1 or Th2 phenotypes, ignoring
CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells. We also assume that all Tregs in the TS are natural Tregs (nTregs),
ignoring induced Tregs (iTregs). We assume, for simplicity, that activated neutrophils polarise into
the N1/N2 dichotomy, and that activated macrophages polarise into the M1/M2 dichotomy. We also
assume that the duration of pembrolizumab infusion is negligible compared to the timescale of the
model. Therefore, we treat their infusions as an intravenous bolus so that drug absorption occurs
immediately after infusion. Finally, to ensure that all concentrations stay positive regardless of the
initial conditions, for biological realism, we assume that cells do not interact before t = 0, setting their
concentrations to nil for t < 0.

We assume that all species, Xi, degrade/die at a rate proportional to their concentration, with decay
constant dXi. We assume that the rate of activation/polarisation of a species Xi by a species Xj
follows the Michaelis-Menten kinetic law λXiXjXi
Xj
KXiXj +Xj , for rate constant λXiXj, and half-saturation
constant KXiXj. Similarly, we model the rate of inhibition of a species Xi by a species Xj using a term
with form λXiXj
Xi
1+Xj/KXiXj for rate constant λXiXj, and half-saturation constant KXiXj. Production of
Xi by Xj is modelled using mass-action kinetics unless otherwise specified so that the rate that Xi is
formed is given by λXiXjXiXj for some positive constant λXiXj. Finally, we assume that the rate of lysis
of Xi by Xj follows mass-action kinetics in the case where Xj is a cell, and follows Michaelis-Menten
kinetics in the case where Xj is a cytokine.
2.2
Model Summary
We now outline some of the main processes accounted for in the model, with all processes and equations
being explained in Section 2.3.
1. CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells induce apoptosis of cancer cells with this being
inhibited by proteins including TGF-β, IL-6, PD-1 and PD-L1.
However, TNF and IFN-γ
induce necroptosis of cancer cells, causing them to become necrotic before they are removed.
2. Necrotic cancer cells release DAMPs such as HMGB1, calreticulin, and extracellular ATP which
stimulate immature DCs to mature.
3. Some mature DCs migrate to the T cell zone of the TDLN and activate naive CD4+ and CD8+
T cells, with this being inhibited by PD-1 and CTLA-4.
4. Activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells undergo clonal expansion and proliferate rapidly in the
TDLN, with this proliferation being inhibited by the PD-1/PD-L1 complex and CTLA-4.
7
5. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that have completed proliferation migrate to the TS and perform
effector functions including the secretion of pro-inflammatory (IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF, IL-12, IL-1β)
and immunosuppressive (TGF-β, IL-10, IL-4, IL-6) cytokines. Extended exposure to the cancer
antigen can lead CD8+ T cells to become exhausted, however, this exhaustion can be reversed
by pembrolizumab.
6. In addition, mature DCs, NK cells, neutrophils, macrophages and CAFs secrete cytokines that
can activate NK cells, and polarise and repolarise macrophages and neutrophils into pro-inflammatory
and immunosuppressive phenotypes.
2.3
Model Equations
Cancer cells are killed by effector CD8+ T cells [86], activated NK cells [87] and Th1 cells [88, 89]
through direct contact, whilst TNF and IFN-γ indirectly eliminate cancer cells via activating cell death
pathways [90–92]. In particular, TNF and IFN-γ induce the necroptosis, programmed necrotic cell
death, of cancer cells [91, 93]. We note that TGF-β and PD-L1 have been shown to inhibit cancer cell
lysis by CD8+ T cells [94, 95], and IL-6 and PD-1 have been shown to inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity
[96, 97]. We assume that cancer cells grow logistically, as is done in many CRC models [42, 44, 46],
due to space and resource competition in the TME. Combining these, we have

Immature DCs are stimulated to mature via DAMPs such as HMGB1, ATP, and calreticulin [56]; how-
ever, we employ Michaelis-Menten kinetics to accommodate for the limited rate of receptor recycling
8
time [48]. In addition, NK cells have been shown to efficiently kill immature DCs but not mature DCs
[102, 103]. Assuming that immature DCs are supplied at a rate AD0, we have that

We also need to consider that some mature DCs migrate into the T cell zone of the TDLN and stimulate
naive CD8+ T cells, causing them to be activated, hence no longer naive [104, 105]. We assume a
fixed DC migration time of τm and also assume that only e−dDτm of the mature DCs that leave the
TS survive migration. Taking into account the volume change between the TS site and the TDLN, we
have that

where θ(x) is the Heaviside function which equals 1 if x ≥0, and 0 otherwise. The Heaviside function
ensures positive invariance of the system by preventing cells from interacting before t = 0.
We now consider the concentration of naive T cells in the TDLN. We assume that naive CD8+ T
cells come into the TDLN at a constant rate and that they have not undergone cell division, nor will
they until their activation. For simplicity, we do not consider cytokines in the TDLN, absorbing their
influence into λT 8
0 T 8
A. We do, however, explicitly take into account the influence of PD-1 and CTLA-4
in the TDLN, which have been shown to inhibit T cell activation through limiting naive T cells from
binding to mature DCs [106, 107]. Thus, taking this all into account leads to

(2.10)
In particular, since PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibit T cell activation during the whole activation process,
it is not sufficient to consider point estimates of PD-1 and CTLA-4 concentration. Instead, we resort
to considering the integrals of the concentration of these immune checkpoint proteins throughout the
entire τ act
8
time that the CD8+ T cell takes to complete activation. This is because these integrals are
proportional (with a proportionality constant of 1/τ act
8 ) to the average concentration of these proteins
throughout activation, allowing us to properly incorporate its inhibition by PD-1 and CTLA-4.
We now are interested in finding the concentration of effector CD8+ T cells over time. It is known
9
that activated CD8+ T cells undergo clonal expansion in the TDLN and differentiate before they stop
proliferating and migrate to the TS [108, 109].
We assume that activated CD8+ T cells proliferate up to n8
max times upon which they stop divid-
ing. For simplicity, we assume that the death rate of CD8+ T cells that have not completed their
division program is equal to dT 8
0 , the death rate of naive CD8+ T cells, regardless of the number
of cell divisions previously undergone. We also assume that only activated CD8+ T cells that have
undergone n8
max divisions become effector CD8+ T cells which will leave the TDLN and migrate to the
TS. Furthermore, we assume a constant cell cycle time ∆8, except for the first cell division which has
cycle time ∆0
8. Thus, the duration of the activated CD8+ T cell division program to n8
max divisions is
given by
τT 8
A = ∆0
8 + (n8
max −1)∆8.
(2.11)
In particular, we must take into account that some T cells will die before the division program is
complete, and so we must introduce a shrinkage factor of e
−dT 8
0 τT 8
A. Furthermore, we must also take
into account that the PD-1/PD-L1 complex and CTLA-4 inhibit CD8+ T cell proliferation throughout
the program [23, 110]. We finally assume that the death rate of CD8+ T cells that have completed
their division program is equal to the death rate of CD8+ T cells in the TS. Taking this all into account
leads to

(2.12)
One thing we must consider is that these CD8+ T cells must first migrate to the TS before they are
able to attack and kill cancer cells. We denote T8(t) as the concentration of effector CD8+ T cells
in the TS, and we assume that it takes τa amount of time for effector CD8+ T cells in the TDLN
to migrate to the TS. We must also account for CTL expansion due to positive growth factors such
as IL-2 [111], with this being inhibited by PD-1/PD-L1 complexes [112]. Furthermore, the death of
CD8+ T cells is resisted by IL-10 [113, 114].
However, chronic antigen exposure can cause effector CD8+ T cells to enter a state of exhaustion,
where they lose their ability to kill cancer cells, and the rate of cytokine secretion significantly de-
creases [57, 115, 116]. We denote this exhausted CD8+ T cell population as Tex(t). It has also been
shown that pembrolizumab can “reinvigorate” these cells back into the effector state [29, 117]. We
model the re-invigoration and exhaustion using Michaelis-Menten terms in A1 and
´ t
t−τl C(s) ds re-
spectively, where τl is the median time that CD8+ T cells take to become exhausted after entering the
TS. In particular, this has been shown to be more appropriate than simple mass-action kinetics as it
accounts for extended antigen exposure [118]. As before, we introduce a Heaviside function θ(t −τl),
as we assume that CD8+ T cells need to spend at least τl in the TS for them to be able to be exhausted.
As such, remembering to take the volume change between the TDLN and the TS into account, this

We perform a similar process for CD4+ T helper cells and first consider naive CD4+ T cells in the
TDLN. For simplicity, we consider only Th1 and Th2 subtypes that naive CD4+ T cells differentiate

λT 4

some mature DCs migrate into the TDLN and activate naive CD4+ T cells, causing them to no longer
be naive, and assuming that naive CD4+ T cells come into the TDLN at a rate AT 4

As before, we are interested in finding the concentration of effector Th1 and Th2 cells over time, and
for simplicity, we only consider the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells and Th2 cells. We
assume that Th1 cells and Th2 cells proliferate up to n1
max and n2
max times, respectively, upon which
they stop dividing. As before, we assume that the death rate of Th1 and Th2 cells that have not
completed their division program is equal to dT 4
0 , the death rate of naive CD4+ T cells, regardless of
the number of cell divisions previously undergone or their phenotype. We assume a constant cell cycle
time ∆i, except for the first cell division which has cycle time ∆0
i . Thus, the duration of the activated
CD4+ T cell division program to ni
max divisions is given by
τT i
A = ∆0
i + (ni
max −1)∆i.
(2.17)
In particular, we must take into account that some T cells will die before the division program is
complete, so we must introduce a shrinkage factor of e
−dT 4
0 τT i
A. Furthermore, we must also take into
account that the PD-1/PD-L1 complex and CTLA-4 inhibit CD4+ T cell proliferation throughout
the program [23, 110]. We finally assume that the death rate of CD4+ T cells that have completed
their division program is equal to the corresponding degradation rate in the TS. Taking this all into

Finally, we consider the concentration of Tregs in the TDLN, following the same procedure as for
CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T helper cells. We absorb the influence of cytokines on Treg activation
via the kinetic rate constant λT r
0 T r
A. We also take into account that PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibit Treg
activation and some mature DCs migrate into the TDLN and activate naive Tregs, causing them to
no longer be naive. Assuming that naive Tregs come into the TDLN at a rate AT r

We assume that activated Tregs proliferate up to nr

become effector Tregs. As before, we assume that the death rate of Tregs that have not completed
their division program is equal to dT r
0 , the death rate of naive Tregs. We assume a constant cell cycle
time ∆r, except for the first cell division which has cycle time ∆0
r. Thus, the duration of the activated
Treg division program to nr
max divisions is given by
τT r
A = ∆0
r + (nr

TNF and IFN-γ polarise naive macrophages into M1 macrophages [127–130], whilst IL-4, IL-10 and

induce M1 macrophages to convert into M2 macrophages [136–138]. Furthermore, M2 macrophages
change phenotype to M1 under the influence of IL-12 [139] and TNF [127] whilst IFN-γ induces M2

Naive NK cells are activated by IL-2 and IL-12 [141, 142]. In addition, immature and mature DCs
activate NK cells [143]. Thus, assuming a supply rate AK0 of naive NK cells, we have that

IL-12 is produced by N1 neutrophils [82, 160] and M1 macrophages with IL-10 suppressing this ex-

has been shown to inhibit this production [164]. Taking all of these factors into account, we have

IL-10 is produced by cancer cells [165, 166], Th2 cells [167, 168], and M2 macrophages [169, 170].
Additionally, Tregs secrete IL-10 [171] with IL-2 enhancing this production [172]. In particular, IL-2
binds to its cognate receptors and is rapidly internalised [173] which we account for using Michaelis-

It is known that PD-1 is expressed on the surface of effector and exhausted CD8+ T cells [181–183],
effector Th1 cells [184], effector Tregs [185], and M2 macrophages [186, 187]. In the case where no
pembrolizumab is administered, we assume that PD-1 expression is proportional to the density of the
cell expressing it. For example the total number of PD-1 molecules expressed by Th1 cells in the TS
is ρP 1
DT1 for some constant ρP 1
D. If no pembrolizumab is present, then PD simply follows
PD = ρP 8
DT8 + ρP ex
D Tex + ρP 1
DT1 + ρP r
DTr + ρP M2
D M2.
(2.44)
However, when pembrolizumab is injected, PD-1 on these PD-1-expressing cells can bind to the pem-
brolizumab drug, causing their depletion [27] and in turn changing the number of PD-1 molecules
expressed on each cell. We assume, however, that the ratio of the number of PD-1 molecules expressed
on each cell stays invariant. We must finally take into account acquired resistance to pembrolizumab
[188–190]. We incorporate resistance by considering an accumulation penalty for PD-1-pembrolizumab
in the form of an inhibition term in
´ t
0 A1(s) ds. Properly accounting for depletion and resistance, and
denoting dPDA1 as the rate at which PD-1 binds to pembrolizumab, leads to

A derivation of (2.45) can be found in Appendix A. For simplicity, we assume that only activated T
cells that have undergone their maximum possible divisions express PD-1 on their surface, and that
the number of PD-1 molecules on T cells in the TDLN is the same as for those in the TS. Accounting
for depletion and resistance as in (2.45), we have that

We also know that PD-L1 is expressed on the surface of cancer cells [191], DCs [192], effector CD8+
T cells [193, 194], effector Th1 cells [195], effector Tregs [185], CAFs [196–198], M2 macrophages [199],
and N1 and N2 neutrophils [200, 201]. The equation for PL has a similar form to (2.45), except there
is no anti-PD-L1 present, so that
PL = ρP C

PD-L1 binds to PD-1 on the surfaces of effector and exhausted CD8+ cells, effector Th1 cells, effector
Tregs and M2 macrophages forming the PD-1/PD-L1 complex [202]. This formation is a reversible
chemical process, with association occurring at a rate of αPDPL and dissociation occurring at a rate of
dQ, so that the reaction can be expressed as PD + PL
αPDPL

Since the half-life of Q is very small, being less than 1 second (≈1.16 × 10−5 days) [203], we employ
a quasi-steady state approximation for Q, so that dQ
dt = 0 =⇒αPDPLPDPL −dQQ, or equivalently

We assume that pembrolizumab is injected intravenously at times t1, t2, . . . , tn with doses γ1, γ2, . . . , γn
respectively. Accounting for depletion due to blocking PD-1, the systemic nature of pembrolizumab
distribution, and assuming that the duration of infusion is negligible in comparison to the time period
of interest, we have that

We now consider CTLA-4. We know that CTLA-4 is expressed on the surface of effector and exhausted
CD8+ T cells [204, 205], effector Th1 cells and Th2 cells [206], and effector Tregs [207, 208]. However,
it was found in [206] that the surface expression of CTLA-4 by Th1 cells is almost undetectable,
whereas Th2 cell CTLA-4 surface expression was easily detected. Thus, we do not consider CTLA-4
expression by Th1 cells. The equations for CTLA-4 are identical in structure to those for PD-L1, so
that

Steady States and Initial Conditions
We estimate all initial conditions and steady states under the assumption that no pembrolizumab
has/will be administered. We assume that the patient initially has stage IIIA or stage IIIB MSI-
H/dMMR colorectal adenocarcinoma with metastasis to at least one lymph node.
3.1
Tumour Site Cell Steady States and Initial Conditions
Digital cytometry has proved itself to be a powerful technique in characterising immune cell popu-
lations from individual patients’ bulk tissue transcriptomes without requiring physical cell isolation
[264–268]. In particular, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) deconvolution of tumour gene expressions has
been very useful in determining their immune profile and adjusting treatment accordingly.
Using the UCSC Xena web portal [269], RSEM normalised RNA-seq gene expression profiles of patients
from the TCGA COAD and TCGA READ projects [43], featuring patients with colorectal adenocar-
cinomas. Corresponding clinical and biospecimen data were downloaded from the GDC portal [270]
which includes tumour dimensions, necrotic cell percentage, AJCC TNM stage, and MSIsensor and
MANTIS MSI statuses. We filtered for samples from primary samples and with non-empty necrosis
25
percentage data, from patients with AJCC stage III or stage IV CRC, and at least one of MANTIS
score > 0.4 or MSIsensor score > 3.5%, as these are the default thresholds for MSI-H [271]. We use
the stage IIIC and stage IV samples to infer steady states, and the stage IIIA and stage IIIB samples
to infer initial conditions. For all algorithms outlined in the sequel, we aggregate the estimates by
taking the median of the relevant non-zero values elementwise, and then normalising such that their
sums become 1.
To estimate immune cell population proportions in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC, we ap-
ply multiple algorithms and then synthesise their results to obtain estimates for all cell types in the
model. We first use the ImmuCellAI algorithm [272] which estimates the abundance of 24 immune
cell types from gene expression data and has also been shown to be highly accurate in predicting
immunotherapy response. These immune cell types include 18 T cell subsets, including CD4+ T cells
which incorporate T helper cells (namely Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th17 cells, and T follicular helper cells),
regulatory T cells (including natural Tregs (nTregs), induced Tregs (iTregs), and type 1 regulatory T
cells (Tr1s)), naive CD4+ T cells (CD4_naive) and other CD4+ T cells (CD4_T). In addition, they
include naive CD8+ T cells (CD8_T), cytotoxic T cells or CTLs (Tc), exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex)
cells, central memory T cells (Tcm), effector memory T cells (Tem), natural killer T cells (NKT), γδ
T cells (Tgd), and mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT). ImmuCellAI also estimates the abun-
dance of DCs, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, and neutrophils. Direct correspondences
between state variables in the model and ImmuCellAI cell types are shown in Table B.1. Addition-
ally, the aggregated estimated cell proportions generated by ImmuCellAI for steady states and initial
conditions, after normalisation, are shown in Table B.2 and Table B.3.
To determine the proportions of D0 and D, K0 and K, M0 and M1 and M2, we use the CIBER-
SORTx algorithm [264], due to its high accuracy [273]. We followed a similar approach to [42] and
[44] and applied CIBERSORTx B-mode on the refined gene expression data, using the validated LM22
signature matrix [268], which gave relative immune cell proportions of 22 immune cell types using 547
signature genes derived from microarray data. Direct correspondences between state variables in the
model and keys of the LM22 signature matrix are shown in Table B.4. The aggregated estimated cell
proportions generated by CIBERSORTx for steady states and initial conditions, after normalisation,
are shown in Table B.5 and Table B.6.
We integrated the relative proportions within cell types for DCs, NK cells, and macrophages out-
putted by CIBERSORTx into the ImmuCellAI abundance estimates. In studies of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma, the ratio of the median number of tumour-associated N1 and tumour-associated N2
neutrophils was 10.7 : 20 – 21 [274, 275]. From this, we assume that there is a 1 : 2 ratio of N1/N2
neutrophils in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We also assume that the ratio of N0 neutrophils
to the total of N1 and N2 neutrophils is equal to the ratio of M0 macrophages to the total of M1
and M2 macrophages. That is, at steady state, N0 : N1 + N2 = 0.048864 : 0.281657, and we set
the initial condition such that N0 : N1 + N2 = 0.062173 : 0.161427. We also note that the density
of immune cells in a healthy adult colon is approximately 3.37 × 107 cell/g [276], which assuming a
tissue density of 1.03 g/cm3, results in a total immune cell density of 3.47 × 107 cell/cm3. However,
advanced cancer induces lymphadenopathy [277, 278], which [276] estimates results in an increase in
the total number of lymphocytes of at most 10%. As such, we assume that there is a 10% increase in
lymphocyte concentration in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC.
To determine the densities of CAFs, which are considered to be essentially all fibroblasts in the TME
[60], we used MCP-counter [279]. MCP-counter uses a gene expression matrix to estimate the sample
26
relative abundance of eight immune and two stromal cell populations in the TME from gene expression
data and is amongst the highest accuracy and specificity estimation methods available [280]. The ag-
gregated estimated cell proportions generated by MCP-counter for steady states and initial conditions,
after normalisation, are shown in Table B.7 and Table B.8.
To estimate CAF densities at steady state and to choose its initial condition, we assume that the
ratio of all immune cells (that is cells excluding endothelial cells and fibroblasts) to fibroblasts given
by MCP-counter is the ratio of immune cells to fibroblasts in the TME. Combining everything, the
resultant steady-state approximations and initial conditions for the model are shown in Table 3 and
Table 4.

We follow [44], and at steady state assume that the density of cancer cells is approximately double
that of the total number of immune cells (excluding fibroblasts). From the TCGA biospecimen data,
the median necrotic cancer cell percentage for stage IIIA and stage IIIB MSI-H CRC samples is 10%,
and 5% for stage IIIC and stage IV MSI-H CRC. As such, denoting TIC as the total immune cell
density, TCD as the total cell density, and Np as the necrotic cell percentage, we have that
C + Nc = 2 × TIC,
(3.1)
Nc
Np
=
C
1 −Np
,
C = 2 × TIC × (1 −Np) =⇒Nc = 2 × TIC × Np.
(3.2)
Taking into account lymphadenopathy, and using data from [276], we assume that the total immune cell
density in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC at steady state is approximately 3.67 × 107 cell/cm3.
Thus, at steady state C ≈6.97 × 107 cell/cm3 and Nc ≈3.67 × 106 cell/cm3.
A retrospective cohort study by Burke et al., considered CRC patients at Leeds Teaching Hospi-
tals NHS Trust over a 2-year interval, who received no treatment and who underwent CT twice more
than 5 weeks apart. It was found that in patients whose M category changed from M0 to M1, the
median interval between CTs was 155 days, and the median tumour doubling time was 172 days [281].
As such, we assume that it takes 155 days for C to reach its steady-state value. This corresponds to
an initial condition for C being C(0) = 3.54 × 107 cell/cm3 and thus Nc(0) ≈3.93 × 106 cell/cm3.

A, T r
A, we can use Immu-
CellAI on the GSE26571 dataset from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus repository [282, 283]. This
contains 9 samples of lymph node metastases from 7 patients with colon adenocarcinoma, with data
from [284]. However, the dataset’s metadata does not contain AJCC TNM stages for patients. To
estimate the TNM stages of the patients with lymph node metastases, noting that lymph node metas-
tases guarantee a TNM stage of at least stage IIIA, we consider the samples of the primary tumour
for these patients and apply the ImmuCellAI algorithm to estimate their immune cell abundances,
ignoring Tcm and Tem cell subtypes. Mappings between ImmuCellAI immune cell types and TDLN
cell types in the model are shown in Table B.9.
We categorise patients as being in stage IIIA or stage IIIB if their lymph node metastases are well
or moderately differentiated and categorise patients as being in stage IIIC or stage IV if their lymph
node metastases are poorly differentiated, noting that poorer differentiation is correlated with more
advanced disease staging in CRC [285]. As before, we use lymph node metastases from stage IIIC and
stage IV patients to infer TDLN steady states, and the stage IIIA and stage IIIB samples to infer
initial conditions. Aggregating the estimates, as before, and then normalising such that their sums
become 1, results in the proportions as shown in Table B.10 and Table B.11.
The density of immune cells in the lymph nodes of an adult is approximately 1.8×109 cell/g [276], which
assuming a tissue density of 1.03 g/cm3, results in a total immune cell density of 1.854 × 109 cell/cm3.
Finally, we assume that in the TDLN, the number of activated CD8+ T cells having undergone n8
max
divisions is roughly half the number which have only undergone n8
max −1 divisions and so forth. Fur-
thermore, we assume that initially, and at steady state, 10% of all Tregs are naive. Thus, we assume
that for i = 8, 1, 2,
T i
A =
2ni

Results
We now aim to optimise neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC.
For simplicity, we assume that pembrolizumab is given at a constant dosage and the spacing between
consecutive pembrolizumab infusions is constant. We also assume that the patient has pembrolizumab
at t = 0 days, and we consider a treatment regimen lasting for 12 weeks so that the time for the latest
allowed infusion is t = 84 days, and simulate to 20 weeks = 140 days.
It is important to note that the administered dose is not equal to the corresponding change in concen-
tration in either A1 or ALN
1 . We assume linear pharmacokinetics, so that ξj, γj = fpembroξj for some
scaling factor fpembro. To determine these, we use the formula
fpembro = Cmax,ss(ξpembro) −Cmin,ss(ξpembro)
ξpembro
,
(4.1)
where Cmax,ss/Cmin,ss corresponds to the maximum and minimum serum concentration of pembrolizumab
at steady state after a dose, ξpembro, of pembrolizumab is administered, respectively.
For pembrolizumab, the mean Cmin,ss/Cmax,ss was found to be approximately 32.6/85.8 µg/mL and
22.4/147.7 µg/mL for Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 respectively [286].
This results in fpembro ≈
2.90 × 10−7 g/cm3 day−1/mg of pembrolizumab administered for all doses.
In our optimisation of pembrolizumab therapy, we consider the following three endpoints: tumour
volume reduction (TVR), efficiency, and toxicity.
We define V (t) = C(t)+Nc(t) as the total cancer concentration at time t without treatment, and define
V (ξpembro; ηpembro, t) = C(ξpembro; ηpembro, t) + Nc(ξpembro; ηpembro, t) as the total cancer concentration at
time t with treatment with pembrolizumab doses of ξpembro at a dosing interval of ηpembro. We define
the efficacy at t from this regimen to be
efficacy(ξpembro; ηpembro, t) := V (t) −V (ξpembro; ηpembro, t)
V (t)
× 100%.
(4.2)
We also define the TVR similarly, as
TVR(ξpembro; ηpembro, t) := V (0) −V (ξpembro; ηpembro, t)
V (0)
× 100%.
(4.3)
30
In particular, the efficacy represents the extent of tumour volume shrinkage throughout its growth
course in comparison to no treatment, whereas the TVR reveals how much the absolute tumour
volume has reduced since the commencement of treatment. We see that the TVR and efficacy are
linearly related via the formula
TVR(ξpembro; ηpembro, t) =

1 −V (0)
V (t) + V (0) efficacy (ξpembro; ηpembro, t)
V (t)

× 100%,
(4.4)
so that an increase in treatment efficacy results in increased TVR, and vice-versa. As such, we calcu-
late only the TVR and the corresponding treatment efficacy can be calculated via (4.4).
We can also consider the efficiency of the treatment regimen, with a dosing interval of ηpembro and
dosage ξpembro given by
efficiency(ξpembro; ηpembro, t) := TVR(ξpembro; ηpembro, t)
ξpembro (1 + ⌊t/ηpembro⌋),
(4.5)
where ξpembro (1 + ⌊t/ηpembro⌋) is the total dose of pembrolizumab administered by time t. This corre-
sponds to the ratio between the TVR percentage and the total dose of pembrolizumab administered.
Finally, we can define the toxicity of the treatment regimen, noting that large enough pembrolizumab
concentrations can potentially cause hepatotoxicity and ocular toxicity [287, 288], as well as increase the
probability of serious infections, and malignancies. Experiments show that dosages of pembrolizumab
between 0.1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, given every 2 weeks, is safe and tolerable [289, 290]. We thus
assume that the threshold for pembrolizumab toxicity is 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, with higher doses
being deemed toxic. To rigorise this notion, we define the toxicity of the treatment regimen, with dose
interval ηpembro and dosage ξpembro, as
toxicity(ξpembro; ηpembro, t) := max


max
s∈[0,t] A1(ξpembro; ηpembro, s)
max
s∈[0,t] A1(800 mg; 14 days, s),
max
s∈[0,t] ALN
1 (ξpembro; ηpembro, s)
max
s∈[0,t] ALN
1 (800 mg; 14 days, s)

.
(4.6)
In particular, A1(ξpembro; ηpembro, s) and ALN
1 (ξpembro; ηpembro, s) denote the concentrations of A1 and
ALN
1
at time s, with pembrolizumab doses of ξpembro at a dosing interval of ηpembro, respectively, noting
that we assume a patient mass of 80 kg. In particular, the toxicity quantifies the ratio of the maximum
pembrolizumab concentrations from the regimen to those of a 10 mg/kg dose given every 2 weeks, tak-
ing the highest value of this ratio between the TDLN and TS. A toxicity greater than 1 indicates a
toxic and unsafe regimen, whereas a toxicity of 1 or less signifies a non-toxic and safe regimen, with
lower toxicity values corresponding to safer treatments.
Denoting the dosing interval of pembrolizumab as ηpembro, we perform a sweep across the space
ηpembro ∈{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84, ∞} days, where ηpembro = ∞days denotes a single dose
of treatment, given at t = 0 days.
These values are integer factors of 84 days, and each ηpembro
corresponds to a distinct number of doses administered. This approach ensures practicality whilst
preventing any artefacts that could occur from selecting a treatment regimen that ends at a fixed time
of 12 weeks. We consider 500 linearly spaced dosages in the domain ξpembro ∈[1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg],
corresponding to ξpembro ∈[80 mg, 800 mg], assuming a patient mass of 80 kg.
It is also beneficial for us to consider FDA-approved pembrolizumab regimens for the first-line treat-
ment of metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC as a benchmark for comparison. There are 2 distinct treatment
31
regimens for pembrolizumab therapy that are approved by the FDA for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC
in adults [291]:
• Treatment 1: 200 mg of pembrolizumab administered by intravenous infusion over a duration of
30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
• Treatment 2: 400 mg of pembrolizumab administered by intravenous infusion over a duration of
30 minutes every 6 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
These correspond to the following parameter values in the model:
• Treatment 1: ξj = 200 mg, γj = fpembroξj, tj = 21(j −1), n = 5,
• Treatment 2: ξj = 400 mg, γj = fpembroξj, tj = 42(j −1), n = 3.
Furthermore, this corresponds to a dose of 2.5 mg/kg(5 mg/kg) of pembrolizumab being administered
in Treatment 1(2), assuming a patient mass of 80 kg.
Heatmaps of TVR, efficiency, and toxicity at t = 20 weeks for these ηpembro and ξpembro values are
shown in Fig 1. All simulations were done in MATLAB using the dde23 solver with the initial condi-
tions stated in Section 3 and drug parameters as above.
Fig 1: TVR (top left and top right), efficiency (bottom left), and toxicity (bottom right) at 20 weeks
for ηpembro in the domain {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84, ∞} days with 500 linearly spaced ξpembro
dosages between 80 mg and 800 mg. The FDA-approved regimens (Treatment 1 and Treatment 2)
for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC are shown in black and the optimal treatment regimen for locally
advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC is shown in blue. We note that the bounds represented by the colour
bar of the top-right figure differ from those in the top-left figure.
We can determine the optimal pembrolizumab therapy by considering the regimen that achieves an
acceptable TVR at 20 weeks, whilst maximising treatment efficiency as much as possible and ensuring
32
a toxicity of less than 1. The TVR of Treatment 1 at 20 weeks was calculated to be 82.71%, and the
TVR of Treatment 2 at 20 weeks was calculated to be 87.67%. As such, to ensure that the TVR of
the optimal treatment is comparable to or greater than that of current FDA-approved pembrolizumab
regimens, we set the threshold TVR to be 85.5%. We also consider constraints due to practicality, so
that ηopt
pembro ∈{7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84, ∞} days, so that the pembrolizumab dose intervals are an integer
number of weeks. We also constrain that ηopt
pembro is an integer multiple of 0.1 mg/kg, corresponding to
an integer multiple of 8 mg. Denoting the space of (ξpembro, ηpembro) pairs that satisfy these criteria as
Sprac, the optimal pembrolizumab dosing and spacing, denoted ξopt
pembro and ηopt
pembro, satisfy

(4.7)
Solving (4.7), leads to the optimal therapy occuring when ξopt
pembro = 640 mg and ηopt
pembro = ∞days.
This corresponds to a single dose of 640 mg, corresponding to 8 mg/kg, and results in a TVR of
85.62%, an efficiency of 1.34 × 10−1%/mg, and a toxicity of 2.87 × 10−1 at 20 weeks. Time traces for
total cancer concentration (C + Nc) under optimal pembrolizumab therapy, compared to Treatments
1 and 2 and no treatment, are shown in Fig 2.

We can also compare the effect of optimal pembrolizumab therapy, against Treatments 1 and 2, as
well as no treatment, on the TME, with time traces of key variables shown in Fig 3.

Discussion
We can see from Fig 2 and Fig 3, that Treatments 1 and 2 are highly effective in eradicating cancer
cells. Without treatment, the total cancer cell concentration (including necrotic cancer cells), at 20
weeks equals 7.32 × 107 cell/cm3, however, equals 6.80 × 106 cell/cm3, and 4.85 × 106 cell/cm3 with
Treatments 1 and 2 respectively. This corresponds to an efficacy of 90.71% and 93.38% for Treatments
1 and 2, respectively. In particular, this leads to two immediate, but important, observations. We
must note that when comparing pembrolizumab, we must ensure that we take into account that locally
advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients will have not been treated with chemotherapy/other therapies
34
and that these drugs are given as a first-line treatment. Firstly, higher doses at larger intervals are
comparable but slightly more effective than smaller doses at shorter intervals, which is consistent with
clinical and experimental observations for other cancers [36, 292]. It is difficult to compare our results
to that of pre-existing clinical trials for locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC due to the lack of time-
series data, widely varying treatment regimens tested and the broad range of outcomes found. Focusing
on Treatment 1, which appears to be the primary focus of ongoing clinical trials, a tumour volume
reduction of 82.71% at 20 weeks, following the cessation of treatment at 12 weeks, is consistent with
the extent of response observed. Therefore, we consider the model to be accurate; however, additional
experimental data is needed for further verification. We also observed that slight variations in the
initial conditions had minimal impact on model trajectories after a few days (not shown). Addition-
ally, the first week of treatment induces transient behaviour, arising from the absence of interactions
within the system for t < 0. Moreover, it takes a couple of months for pembrolizumab to begin showing
effects and for tumour reductions to be observed, in agreement with experimental findings for CRC [18].
Furthermore, by analysing immune cell trajectories from Fig 3, offering potential explanations for be-
haviour in the TME and identifying key factors that contribute to maximising cancer reduction. One
of the most important observations is that with pembrolizumab, the concentration of effector CD8+
T cells increases greatly compared to without treatment, with the exhausted CD8+ T cell concentra-
tion decreasing correspondingly. In particular, the concentration of exhausted CD8+ T cells without
treatment at 20 weeks is 1.67×105 cell/cm3 compared to 1.10×105 cell/cm3, 1.05×105 cell/cm3, and
1.10 × 105 cell/cm3 with Treatments 1 and 2, and the optimal treatment respectively. This showcases
that a) pembrolizumab increases the concentration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells through re-invigorating
exhausted CD8+ T cells, and b) the concentration of exhausted CD8+ T cells plays a major role in
treatment efficacy, as a reduction in exhausted T cells results in decreased PD-1 concentrations and
improved cancer eradication.
One important thing to note is that the effector CD8+ T cell population for the optimal regimen
drops significantly after a couple of months, and is only 1.88 × 105 cell/cm3 at 20 weeks, despite
having the largest effector CD8+ T cell population initially. This occurs since the pembrolizumab
concentration at the TS and TDLN gradually declines after the initial infusion so that reinvigoration
of exhausted CD8+ T cells diminishes after a few months. However, the optimal therapy eradicates
the tumour most rapidly, reducing the viable and necrotic cancer cell population to very low levels,
eventually resulting in decreased DAMP release and a reduced influx of effector CD8+ T cells from
the TDLN. Despite this, a sufficient number of effector CD8+ T cells and other cytotoxic cells remain
to sufficiently kill the remaining cancer. In particular, this significantly reduced cancer population
explains why the number of exhausted CD8+ T cells during the optimal treatment is comparable to
Treatments 1 and 2, as the extent of antigen exposure is substantially decreased.
Furthermore, with pembrolizumab inhibitor therapy, the concentration of pro-inflammatory immune
species, such as N1 neutrophils and TNF increase in concentration relative to without treatment, whilst
the concentration of immunosuppressive cell types such as M2 macrophages and CAFs decreases. The
increased concentration of TNF is particularly noteworthy since it directly induces necroptosis of cancer
cells, causing the release of DAMPs, which in turn induces DC maturation. Without treatment, TNF
concentration at 20 weeks is 9.02 × 10−8 g/cm3, compared to 9.72 × 10−8 g/cm3, 9.74 × 10−8 g/cm3,
and 9.72 × 10−8 g/cm3 with Treatments 1 and 2, and the optimal treatment respectively. This further
shows that increased TNF concentration is correlated with enhanced cancer death and treatment effi-
cacy and that inducing more pro-inflammatory immunogenicity in the TME is key for this to occur.
35
We can also analyse the impact of pembrolizumab therapy on the concentration of PD-1 in the TS and
the TDLN, as well as the concentration of CTLA-4. As expected, pembrolizumab therapy massively
decreases the concentration of PD-1 in the TS and the TDLN. At 20 weeks, the concentration of PD-1
in the TS and the TDLN without treatment is 5.96×109 cell/cm3 and 2.47×1010 cell/cm3, respectively.
However, with the optimal treatment, and with Treatments 1 and 2, at 20 weeks the concentration
of PD-1 in the TS is reduced by 27.26%, 26.35%, and 28.62% respectively, and its concentration in
the TDLN reduces by 13.96%, 12.72%, and 14.27% respectively. Thus, we see that treatment efficacy
and success are directly correlated with the extent of PD-1 concentration reduction. This makes sense
since PD-1 inhibits T cell activation in the TDLN, inhibits the cytotoxicity of NK cells, and interacts
with PD-L1 to form PD-1/PD-L1 which inhibits T cell proliferation. Interestingly, after a couple of
months of PD-1 blockade, CTLA-4 concentrations in the TS and TDLN decrease, enhancing T cell
activation and proliferation in the TDLN. However, this also pertains to Tregs, resulting in their in-
creased concentration in the TDLN and at the TS, and slightly reduced IFN-γ levels, highlighting the
need to consider the balance between PD-1 inhibition and Treg proliferation.
We now shift our focus to Fig 1. We see that TVR increases as the dosing increases and spacing
decreases, noting that the effects of acquired resistance to pembrolizumab are quite small since the
treatment regimen has a duration of only 12 weeks. In particular, the TVRs of Treatment 1 and
Treatment 2 are high, and the TVR of treatments does not change significantly near these regions.
Unsurprisingly, the regimens of FDA-approved treatments for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC are quite
efficient, with the efficiency of Treatment 1 being approximately 8.27 × 10−2%/mg and the efficiency
of Treatment 2 being approximately 7.31×10−2%/mg. Whilst these treatments are amongst the most
efficient practical ones, they pale in comparison to the global maximum efficiency of 2.13×10−1%/mg,
achieved by administering a single 255 mg dose of pembrolizumab. There is also a clear transition
between efficient and inefficient treatments, marked by the rapid shift in efficiency as one deviates
from local optima. In particular, treatment is inefficient if its TVR is low, regardless of the dosing
and spacing (corresponding to the top left inefficient region in Fig 1), or if an excessive amount of
pembrolizumab is administered, regardless of the TVR (corresponding to the bottom right inefficient
region in Fig 1).
In the spirit of completeness, we verify that Treatments 1 and 2 are non-toxic, and compare their
toxicity to that of the optimal regimen found. As expected, Treatments 1 and 2 are non-toxic, with
toxicities of 1.85 × 10−1 and 2.46 × 10−1, respectively, whilst the optimal regimen has a toxicity of
2.87 × 10−1. Thus, we see that these treatments are all non-toxic, and the optimal regimen has com-
parable toxicity to FDA-approved regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC.
Striking a balance between TVR, efficiency, and toxicity is difficult, and the current FDA-approved
regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC do this quite well in the case of locally advanced MSI-
H/dMMR CRC. The optimal regimen of administering pembrolizumab as a single dose of 640 mg is
also more efficient, leads to comparable or greater TVR, and is more cost-effective and convenient than
current regimens, whilst again, maintaining practicality and safety. Moreover, lower single doses of
pembrolizumab are effective, with a single dose of 400 mg (equivalent to 5 mg/kg) achieving a TVR
of 74.05%, and a single dose of 560 mg (equivalent to 7 mg/kg) achieving a TVR of 83.10%. The
associated toxicities are 1.79 × 10−1 and 2.51 × 10−1, respectively, which are lower than or comparable
to those of Treatments 1 and 2. Administering a single dose of pembrolizumab before surgery has
proven highly effective for achieving long-term tumour eradication in a phase 1b clinical trial involving
resectable stage III/IV melanoma [293]. In particular, 30% of patients experienced > 90% tumour
36
eradication, and all of these patients remained disease-free at a median follow-up of 25 months. Medium
to high single-dose pembrolizumab demonstrates promising potential for successful and cost-effective
treatment, with a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single-dose of 4 mg/kg
of pembrolizumab in patients with stage I-III dMMR CRC currently underway [294].
It should be noted that the model has several limitations, many of which exist for simplicity, but
the potential for addressing these issues serves as exciting avenues for future research.
• We ignored spatial effects in the model, however, their resolution can provide information about
the distribution and clustering of different immune cell types in the TME and their clinical
implications [295, 296].
• We assumed that the death rates were constant throughout the T cell proliferation program,
however linear death rates, were shown to markedly improve the quality of fit of Deenick et al.’s
model [297] to experimental data [298].
• We considered only the M1/M2 and N1/N2 macrophage and neutrophil dichotomies respectively,
however, their plasticity motivates the description of their phenotypes as a continuum, giving
them the ability to adapt their functions to achieve mixtures of M1/N1 and M2/N2 responses
and functions [76, 299].
• In the optimisation of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy, we restricted ourselves to treatments
with constant dosing and spacing as is common in the literature, however varying dosages and
dosing frequencies may result in improved regimens.
• We did not consider T cell avidity, the overall strength of a TCR-pMHC interaction, which
governs whether a cancer cell will be successfully killed [54]. In particular, high-avidity T cells
are necessary for lysing cancer cells and durable tumour eradication, whilst low-avidity T cells
are ineffective, and may inhibit high-avidity T cells [300, 301].
• We also did not consider the influence of cytokines in the TDLN for T cell activation and
proliferation, which are important in influencing effector T cell differentiation [302, 303].
• The definition of toxicity does not account for its potential origins in autoimmunity, which is a
crucial component of certain adverse effects [287].
In this work, we have provided a framework for mathematically modelling many immune cell types
in the TME, using experimental data to govern parameter estimation, and finally analysing and op-
timising neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy in MSI-H/dMMR CRC for efficacy and efficiency. We
conclude that medium to high single-dose pembrolizumab is more efficient and demonstrates compa-
rable or greater efficacy and TVR than current FDA-approved regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR
CRC, whilst maintaining practicality and safety. In addition, the versatility and power of the methods
and equations herein can be easily adapted to attain a more comprehensive understanding of other
cancers and improve healthcare as a result.

A
Derivation of (2.45)
The derivation of (2.45) follows similarly to that in [1–3], which we include here for completeness. If
no pembrolizumab is present, then PD simply follows the equation
PD = ρP 8
DT8 + ρP ex

DT1 + ρP r
DTr + ρP M2

D
dM2
dt

,
where ρP 1
D is constant. However, when pembrolizumab is injected, PD-1 on these PD-1 expressing
cells can bind to it, causing their depletion [4] and in turn changing the number of PD-1 molecules
expressed on each cell. We assume, however, that the ratio of the number of PD-1 molecules expressed
on each cell stays invariant. Thus, we can replace ρP 1
D above with
PD/

Parameter Estimation
We estimate all parameters, where possible, under the assumption that no pembrolizumab has/will be
administered. The exception to this is the parameters directly related to pembrolizumab treatment
for which the assumptions are explicitly stated during estimation. We also denote 1 d to be 1 day, 1 h
to be 1 hour, 1 m to be 1 minute, and 1 s to be 1 second.
C.1
DAMP Steady States and Initial Conditions
Like cytokines, we note that 1 cm3 = 1 mL for all DAMP measurements.
C.1.1
Estimates for H
In [5], a study of blood samples from 144 patients with CRC was conducted, with the serum HMGB1
levels of patients with distant metastasis being 13.32 ± 6.12 µg/L, which was significantly higher than
those with only lymphatic metastasis at 10.14 ± 4.38 µg/L. We assume that the serum concentrations
and tissue concentrations of HMGB1 are similar, so we take the initial condition of H to be 1.014 ×
10−8 g/cm3 and the steady state to be 1.33 × 10−8 g/cm3.
C.1.2
Estimates for A
Extracellular ATP is present in high concentrations in the TME, and in the TME and metastases,
extracellular ATP concentration can reach several hundred µM [6]. In particular, concentrations of
extracellular ATP in the TME range between 100–700 µM [7], which is 103 – 104 times higher than in
healthy tissue [8]. Since extracellular ATP is produced by necrotic cancer cells, which have a larger
population at steady state compared to initially, we assume that there is more extracellular ATP at
steady state. As such, we take the initial condition for A to be equal to 100 µM and a steady state
equal to 700 µM, corresponding to 6.02 × 1016 molec/cm3 and 4.22 × 1017 molec/cm3, respectively.
Recalling that ATP has a molecular mass of approximately 507.181 Da = 8.419 × 10−22 g [9], this
corresponds to an initial condition of 5.06 × 10−5 g/cm3 and a steady state of 3.55 × 10−4 g/cm3.
6
C.1.3
Estimates for S
In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), calreticulin concentrations when no drugs are introduced were
approximately 2 × 10−2 ± 2.5 × 10−2 µg/mL [10]. Since surface calreticulin is produced by necrotic
cancer cells, which have a larger population at steady state compared to initially, we assume that there
is more surface calreticulin at steady state. We assume that calreticulin concentrations in EOC are
similar to that of MSI-H/dMMR CRC, so we assume an initial condition for S of 2 × 10−8 g/cm3 and
a steady state of 4.5 × 10−8 g/cm3.
C.2
Cytokine Steady States and Initial Conditions
To estimate cytokine steady states and initial conditions, we look at the respective experimental tissue
concentration data, noting that this is more accurate than the more widely available serum/plasma
concentration data. Nonetheless, we use serum/plasma concentration data, where relevant, to guide
estimates if the corresponding tissue concentration data is limited. We note that 1 cm3 = 1 mL for all
cytokine measurements.
C.2.1
Estimates for I2
The tissue concentration of IL-2 in CRC is very low and was found to be below the lower limit of quan-
tification in various experiments [11, 12]. In tumour supernatants of invasive ductal cancer the median
IL-2 concentration was found 2.1 pg/mL with the interquartile range being 2.0 pg/mL −4.9 pg/mL
[13]. We assume similar concentrations of IL-2 in the tissue of CRC patients.
Taking into account the well-documented anti-tumour properties of IL-2 [14, 15] and decreased IL-2
serum concentration in metastatic CRC patients compared to those without distant metastasis [16],
we assume that I2 has a steady state value of 2.00 × 10−9 g/cm3, and we set the initial condition to
be 2.1 × 10−9 g/cm3.
C.2.2
Estimates for Iγ
It was found in [11] that the median tissue concentration of IFN-γ in CRC patients was 15.2 pg/mL,
with the upper quartile concentration being approximately 16.9 pg/mL. It was found in [17] that
the serum concentration of IFN-γ in stage IV CRC patients (median ≈20.75 pg/mL) is significantly
higher than that of stage I-III patients (median ≈1 pg/mL). We thus set the steady state of Iγ to
1.69 × 10−8 g/cm3, with an initial condition of 1.52 × 10−8 g/cm3.
C.2.3
Estimates for Iα
It was found in [17] that in advanced CRC patients, i.e those with stage III or stage IV disease,
the mean TNF tissue concentration was ≈53 pg/mL, with the concentration one standard deviation
above the mean being approximately 90 pg/mL. Furthermore, the serum TNF concentration in stage
IV CRC patients (median 20.3 pg/mL) is significantly higher than in stage III CRC patients (median
16.0 pg/mL) [18]. We thus set the steady state of Iα to 9.00 × 10−8 g/cm3, with an initial condition
of 5.30 × 10−8 g/cm3.
C.2.4
Estimates for Iβ
It was found in [19] that in advanced CRC patients, i.e those with stage III or stage IV disease, the
mean TGF-β tissue concentration was 1311.5 pg/mg, with the concentration one standard deviation
7
above the mean being 1469.1 pg/mg. Assuming a tissue density of 1.03 g/mL, these correspond to
tissue concentrations of 1.35×106 pg/mL and 1.51×106 pg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the serum
TGF-β concentration in stage IV CRC patients (mean 55 pg/mL) is significantly higher than in stage
III CRC patients (mean 45 pg/mL) [20]. We thus set the steady state of Iβ to 1.51×10−3 g/cm3, with
an initial condition of 1.35 × 10−3 g/cm3.
C.2.5
Estimates for I12
The tissue concentration of IL-12 in CRC is very low, and was found to be below the lower limit
of quantification in various experiments [11, 12]. In CRC cells in 3D spheroid cultures, the mean
IL-12 concentration from cell supernatants was found to be ≈0.6 pg/mL, with the concentration
one standard deviation above the mean being ≈0.625 pg/mL [21]. Furthermore, the serum IL-12
concentration in metastatic CRC patients is lower than in patients without distant metastasis [16].
We thus set the steady state of I12 to 6.00×10−10 g/cm3, with an initial condition of 6.25×10−10 g/cm3.
C.2.6
Estimates for I10
It was found in [17] that in advanced CRC patients, i.e those with stage III or stage IV disease,
the mean TNF tissue concentration was 115 pg/mL, with the concentration one standard deviation
above the mean being approximately 184 pg/mL. Furthermore, the serum IL-10 concentration in stage
IV CRC patients (mean 36.02 pg/mL) is significantly higher than in stage III CRC patients (mean
17.07 pg/mL) [22]. We thus set the steady state of I10 to 1.84 × 10−7 g/cm3, with an initial condition
of 1.15 × 10−7 g/cm3.
C.2.7
Estimates for I4
It was found in [17] that in advanced CRC patients, i.e those with stage III or stage IV disease, the
mean TNF tissue concentration was ≈92 pg/mL, with the concentration one standard deviation above
the mean being approximately 150 pg/mL. Furthermore, the serum IL-4 concentration in metastatic
CRC patients is higher than in patients without distant metastasis [16]. We thus set the steady state
of I4 to 9.20 × 10−8 g/cm3, with an initial condition of 5.0 × 10−8 g/cm3.
C.2.8
Estimates for I6
It was found in [19] that in advanced CRC patients, i.e those with stage III or stage IV disease,
the mean IL-6 tissue concentration was 3026.2 pg/mg, with the concentration one standard deviation
above the mean being 3532.9 pg/mg. Assuming a tissue density of 1.03 g/mL, these correspond to
tissue concentrations of 3.11×106 pg/mL and 3.64×106 pg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the tissue
IL-6 concentration in early CRC patients (mean 3026.2 pg/mg) is significantly higher than in advanced
CRC patients (mean 45 pg/mg) [19]. We thus set the steady state of I6 to 3.11 × 10−3 g/cm3, with
an initial condition of 3.64 × 10−3 g/cm3.
C.2.9
Estimates for I1β
It was found in [11], that the median tissue concentration of IL-1β in CRC patients was 36.1 pg/mL,
with the upper quartile concentration being approximately 191.7 pg/mL. It was found in [18], that
the serum concentration of IL-1β in stage IV CRC patients (median 2.28 pg/mL) is significantly
higher than that of stage III patients (median ≈1.63 pg/mL). We thus set the steady state of I1β to
1.92 × 10−7 g/cm3, with an initial condition of 3.61 × 10−8 g/cm3.

Immune Checkpoint Protein Steady States and Initial Conditions
C.3.1
PD-1 Steady States and Initial Conditions
To find many of the parameters for PD, we use the baseline data collected in [23] on 5 advanced
cancer patients, before their pembrolizumab infusions. The net number of PD-1 molecules on the
surface of CD4+ T cells was 2053 molec/cell, and so we set ρP 1
D = ρP r
D = 2.05 × 103 molec/cell. The
net number of PD-1 molecules on the surface of CD8+ T cells was 2761 molec/cell, and so we set
ρP 8
D = 2.76 × 103 molec/cell. However, PD-1 is significantly more expressed on exhausted CD8+ T
cells compared to effector CD8+ T cells [24]. We estimate that there is a 5-fold increase in PD-1
expression on exhausted CD8+ T cells, so we set ρP 8
D = 1.38 × 104 molec/cell. The net number of
PD-1 molecules on the surface of non-classical monocytes T cells was 1474 molec/cell, and assume
that this is the same as that for M2 macrophages, and so we set ρP M2
D
= 1.47 × 103 molec/cell.
This corresponds to
PD = ρP 8

C.3.2
PD-L1 Steady States and Initial Conditions
It was found in [25], that the PD-L1 expression on activated CD3+ PD-L1+ T cells was 9282 molec/cell,
whilst the PD-L1 expression on mature DCs was 80, 372 molec/cell.
However, amongst advanced
CRC patients, only 22.4% of CD4+ T cells were PD-L1+, and only 16.1% of CD8+ T cells were
PD-L1+ [26].
Moreover, only 22% of colonic DCs were PD-L1+ in [27].
We thus assume that
ρP 1
L = ρP r
L = 2.08 × 103 molec/cell, ρP 8
L = 1.49 × 103 molec/cell, and ρP D
L = 1.77 × 104 molec/cell.
It was estimated in [28] and [1], that the ratio of net PD-L1 molecules on M2 macrophages to that of
activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is 0.01. We assume this too, so that ρP M2
L /0.01 = (ρP 1
L +ρP 8
L)/2 =⇒
ρP M2
L
= 1.79×103 molec/cell. Furthermore, we assume that the ratio ρP M2
L
: ρP C
L : ρP CF
L
: ρP N1
L
: ρP N2
L
re-
flects the percentage of PD-L1+ M2 macrophages, PD-L1+ tumour cells, PD-L1+ CAFs, PD-L1+ N1
neutrophils, and PD-L1+ N2 neutrophils, respectively. Amongst advanced CRC patients, only 33.4%
of tumour cells were PD-L1+, 56.0% of CD90+ stromal cells were PD-L1+, and 35.6% of CD11b+
myeloid cells were PD-L1+ [26]. We assume that the percentage of PD-L1+ M2 macrophages, N1
neutrophils and N2 neutrophils is equal to the percentage of PD-L1+ CD11b+ myeloid cells, and that
the percentage of PD-L1+ CAFs is equal to the percentage of CD90+ stromal cells. Assuming that
ρP N1
L
= ρP N2
L , we have that ρP M2
L /35.6% = ρP C
L /33.4% = ρP CF
L /56.0% = ρP N1
L /35.6% = ρP N2
L /35.6%.
Thus, we have that ρP N1
L
= ρP N2
L
= 1.79 × 103 molec/cell, ρP C
L = 1.67 × 103 molec/cell, and ρP CF

C.3.4
CTLA-4 Steady States and Initial Conditions
It is known that Tregs constitutively express CTLA-4, unlike effector cells where CTLA-4 production
is induced following antigen activation [29], with its activity not being inhibited by the CTLA-4/B7
complex, unlike that for activated CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ T cells [30, 31]. Moreover, we
know that CTLA-4 is expressed more on exhausted CD8+ T cells than their effector counterparts
[32]. Additionally, in [33] a median of 1.95% of CD4+ T cells expressed CTLA-4 on their surface,
whilst a median of 2.4% of CD8+ T cells expressed CTLA-4 on their surface in health. Assuming that
this ratio stays the same in CRC, and combining everything, we assume that ρP 2
A/1.95 = ρP 8
A/2.4 =
ρP ex
A /(2.4 × 1.2) = ρP r
A/(5 × 1.95).
We assume that at steady state, effector CD8+ T cells express 4 times more PD-1 than CTLA-4.
Thus, ρP 8
A = ρP 8
D/4 = 6.90 × 102 molec/cm3, and so we have that ρP 2
A = 5.61 × 102 molec/cm3,
ρP ex
A = 8.28 × 102 molec/cm3, and ρP r
A = 2.79 × 103 molec/cm3.
This corresponds to

Drug Steady States
C.4.1
Pembrolizumab Steady States
The value of the geometric mean Cavg of pembrolizumab in serum at steady state varied minimally
regardless of whether pembrolizumab was administered at 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 400 mg every 6
weeks [34]. This was equal to approximately 50.8 µg/mL, and we assume this to be the same in tissue,
so we take A1 = 5.08 × 10−5 g/cm3.

C.5
Half-Saturation Constants
We recall that for some species X, KX is denoted the half-saturation constant of X in a term of the
form
X
KX + X .
For simplicity, we assume that if X denotes the steady state value of X, then
X
KX + X = 1
2 =⇒KX = X.

Inhibition Constants
We recall that for some species X, KX is denoted the inhibition constant of X in a term of the form
1
1 + X/KX

For simplicity, we assume that if X denotes the steady state value of X, then

We recall the formula that the degradation rate of some species X, is given by
dX = ln 2
tX
1/2
(C.3)
where tX
1/2 is the elimination half-life of X.

C.7.1
Estimate for dH
The half-life of HMGB1 was found to be approximately 3 hours in the context of prostate cancer [35].
We assume a similar value for MSI-H/dMMR CRC and so
dH = ln 2
3 h = 5.55 d−1.
C.7.2
Estimate for dA
The half-life for extracellular ATP released by prostate cancer cells is approximately 5 minutes [36].
We assume a similar value for MSI-H/dMMR CRC and so

5 m = 2.00 × 102 d−1.
C.7.3
Estimate for dS
Surface calreticulin has a half-life of approximately 12 hours [37, 38]. Thus, we have that

C.7.4
Estimate for dD0
The time taken for immature DCs to degrade is estimated to be 28 days in mice [39]. We assume that

28 d = 3.60 × 10−2 d−1.
C.7.5
Estimate for dD
Mature DCs have a half-life of 1.5 – 2.9 days in mice [40]. We assume that this is similarly the case
for humans, and take tD

2.2 d = 0.32 d−1.
C.7.6
Estimate for dT 8

C.7.7
Estimate for dT8 and dTex
It was measured in [42] that the mean degradation rate of circulating CD8+ T cells in HIV seronegative
patients was 0.009 d−1.
We assume that this is the case for MSI-H/dMMR CRC, and so we set
dT8 = dTex = 0.009 d−1.
13
C.7.8
Estimate for dT 4
0
The half-life of naive CD4+ T cells in the lymph node was estimated to be 17.2 days in [41] so that

C.7.9
Estimate for dT1
It was measured in [42] that the mean degradation rate of circulating CD4+ T cells in HIV seronegative
patients was 0.008 d−1. We assume that this is the case for Th1 cells in MSI-H/dMMR CRC, and so
we set dT1 = 0.008 d−1.1
C.7.10
Estimate for dT2
It was measured in [42] that the mean degradation rate of circulating CD4+ T cells in HIV seronegative
patients was 0.008 d−1. We assume that this is the case for Th2 cells in MSI-H/dMMR CRC, and so
we set dT2 = 0.008 d−1.
C.7.11
Estimate for dT r
0
The degradation rate of naive Tregs in the lymph node was estimated to be 2.2×10−3 d−1 in [43], and
we assume that the degradation rate in MSI-H CRC is similar so that
dT r
0 = 2.2 × 10−3 d−1.
C.7.12
Estimate for dTr
The mean half-life of Tregs in healthy adults was measured to be approximately 11 days in [44]. We
assume that this is similarly the case for MSI-H/dMMR CRC, and so that this corresponds to
dTr = ln 2
11 d = 6.30 × 10−2 d−1.
C.7.13
Estimate for dCF
The half-life of pancreatic stellate cells, one of the most studied subtypes of CAFs in pancreatic cancer,
varies between 2 – 5 days [45]. We assume that the half-life of CAFs in CRC is similar, taking it to
be 3.5 days, so that
dCF = ln 2
3.5 d = 1.98 × 10−1 d−1.
C.7.14
Estimate for dN0, dN1, dN2
The lifespan of neutrophils in a cancer setting is approximately 17 hours [46, 47]. We assume that the
half-lives of naive neutrophils, N1, and N2 neutrophils are all equal to 17 hours, so that
dN0 = dN1 = dN2 = ln 2
17 h = 0.98 d−1.
14
C.7.15
Estimate for dM0
The lifespan for naive macrophages was found in humans to be approximately 1.37 days on average
[48]. This corresponds to
dM0 =
1
1.38 d = 0.72 d−1.
C.7.16
Estimate for dM1
The lifespan for M1 macrophages was found in humans to be approximately 1.01 days on average [48].
This corresponds to
dM0 =
1
1.01 d = 0.99 d−1.
C.7.17
Estimate for dM2
The lifespan for M2 macrophages was found in humans to be approximately 7.41 days on average [48].
This corresponds to
dM0 =
1
7.41 d = 1.35 × 10−1 d−1.
C.7.18
Estimate for dK0 and dK
The half-life of human NK cells varies between 1 – 2 weeks [49–51]. We assume that the half-lives of
naive and activated NK cells are both equal to 10 days, so that
dK0 = dK = ln 2
10 d = 7 × 10−2d−1.
C.7.19
Estimate for dI2
The half-life of IL-2 varies between 5 – 7 minutes [52, 53]. We take tI2
1/2 = 6.9 m so that
dI2 =
ln 2
6.9 m = 1.44 × 102 d−1.
C.7.20
Estimate for dIγ
The half-life of IFN-γ varies between 25 – 35 minutes [54]. We take tIγ
1/2 to be 30 minutes so that
dI2 = ln 2
30 m = 3.33 × 101 d−1.
C.7.21
Estimate for dIα
The half-life of TNF varies between 15 – 30 minutes [55, 56]. We take tIα
1/2 to be 18.2 minutes, so that
dIα =
ln 2
18.2 m = 5.48 × 101 d−1.
15
C.7.22
Estimate for dIβ
The half-life of active TGF-β is approximately 2 – 3 minutes [57]. We take t
Iβ
1/2 = 2.5 m, so that
dIβ =
ln 2
2.5 m = 3.99 × 102 d−1.
C.7.23
Estimate for dI12
The half-life of IL-12 varies between 5.3 – 10.3 hours [58]. We take tI12
1/2 = 7.8 h, so that
dIβ = ln 2
7.8 h = 2.13 d−1.
C.7.24
Estimate for dI10
The half-life of IL-10 varies between 2.7 – 4.5 hours [59]. We take tI10
1/2 = 2.7 h so that
dIβ = ln 2
2.7 h = 6.16 d−1.
C.7.25
Estimate for dI4
The half-life of uncomplexed IL-4 is very short, being approximately 19 minutes [60]. We take tI4
1/2 =
19 m so that
dI4 = ln 2
45 m = 5.25 × 101 d−1.
C.7.26
Estimate for dI6
The half-life of IL-6 varies between 103 minutes in meningococcal septic shock [61] and 15 hours during
acute inflammation [62]. We assume that in MSI-H/dMMR CRC, tI6
1/2 = 15 hours so that
ln 2
15 h = 1.11 d−1.
C.7.27
Estimate for dI1β
The half-life of IL-1β is approximately 3.5 hours [63], so that
ln 2
3.5 h = 4.75 d−1.
C.7.28
Estimate for dA1
The half-life of pembrolizumab varies between 22 – 27 days [64–66]. We take it to be 26 days so that
dA1 = ln 2
26 d = 2.67 × 10−2 d−1.
16
C.7.29
Estimate for dPDA1 and KPDA1
We assume at steady state, that 10% of pembrolizumab is used in blocking PD-1, while the remaining
90% degrades naturally. Considering (2.52), we have that
dPDA1PDA1
10%
= dA1A1
90%
=⇒dPDA1 = dA1
9PD
= 5.24 × 10−13  molec/cm3−1 day−1.
We assume that the extent of inhibition of PD-1 depletion by pembrolizumab is proportional to the
level of acquired resistance. We now estimate KPDA1. It was calculated in [67], that the acquired
resistance rate of 10mg/kg pembrolizumab dosing every 2 weeks for dMMR cancers, as done in [68],
was approximately 11%, at a median of 13 months after treatment commencement. Assuming that
there are 395 days in 13 months and a patient mass of 80 kg, we thus have that
1
1 +

A1(s) ds/KPDA1

A1(s) ds
,
with parameter values of ξj = 800mg, γj = fpembroξj, tj = 14(j −1), n = 28. We now approximate
´ 395
0
A1(s) ds for this regimen. We assume for simplicity, throughout the whole treatment that 10%
of pembrolizumab is depleted due to blocking PD-1, and 90% degrades naturally, ignoring acquired
resistance for this approximation. Thus, we have that
dPDA1PDA1
10%

Numerically solving this using the ode15s integrator leads to
´ 395
0
A1(s) ≈7.83 × 10−3 (g/cm3) day,
so that KPDA1 = 6.33 × 10−2 (g/cm3) day.

C.7.31
Estimate for dQ
The dissociation rate of PD-1/PD-L1 was found to be 1.44 s−1 in [25]. Thus, we have that
dQ = 60 × 60 × 24 × 1.44 s−1 = 1.24 × 105 d−1.
C.7.32
Estimate for αPDPL
The formation rate of PD-1/PD-L1 was found to be 1.84×105 M−1s−1 in [25]. We need to convert this to
units of (molec/cm3)−1d−1. We recall that 1 M = 1 mol/L = 10−3 mol/cm3 = 6.02 × 1020 molec/cm3.
Thus, we have that
αPDPL = 60 × 60 × 24 × 1.84 × 105 × (6.02 × 1020)−1 = 2.64 × 10−11 (molec/cm3)−1d−1.
C.8
DAMP and TS Cell Parameters
C.8.1
Estimates for H
Considering (2.3) at steady state, we have that
λHNcNc + λHCF CF −dHH = 0.
Since HMGB1 is released more by necrotic cancer cells than CAFs, we assume that
λHNc
9
= λHCF
1
.
Solving these simultaneously leads to
λHNc = 1.57 × 10−14 (g/cell) day−1,
λHCF = 1.74 × 10−15 (g/cell) day−1.
C.8.2
Estimates for A
Considering (2.4) at steady state leads to
λANcNc −dAA = 0 =⇒λANc = 1.93 × 10−8 (g/cell) day−1.
C.8.3
Estimates for S
Considering (2.5) at steady state leads to the equation
λSNcNc −dSS = 0.
This leads to
λSNc = 1.70 × 10−14 (g/cell) day−1.
18
C.8.4
Estimates for D0 and D
Adding (2.6) and (2.7) at steady state, leads to
AD0 −λD0KD0K −dD0D0 −λDDLND −dDD = 0.
We assume that HMGB1 is the most potent inducer of DC maturation, followed by extracellular ATP,
with surface calreticulin being the weakest inducer. As such, at steady state, we assume that
λDH
2 × 10 = λDA
2 × 2 = λDS
2 × 1.
In [69], it was also shown that the percentage of immature DCs that were lysed as a result of NK cells
is roughly linear in the ratio of NK cells to immature DCs. When a 1:1 ratio of activated NK cells to
immature DCs is present, after 24 hours, roughly 35.5% of immature DCs are lysed, whereas if a 5:1
ratio is present, 85.5% of immature DCs are lysed. At steady state, the ratio of NK cells to immature
DCs is ≈2.39 : 1, corresponding to an approximate 52.85% being lysed. However, if we consider only
immature DC loss due to degradation, after 24 hours, only 1 −e−dD0 ≈3.54% are lost to it. Thus, we
assume at steady state that
λD0KD0K
0.5285
= dD0D0
0.0354 =⇒λD0K = 1.32 × 10−7  cell/cm3−1 day−1.
Considering (2.7) at steady state leads to
λDHD0
2
+ λDAD0
2
+ λDSD0
2
−λDDLND −dDD = 0.
Finally, it was found in [70] that only a limited number of DCs migrate up to the TDLN, with at
most 4% of DCs reaching the TDLN in melanoma patients when DCs were injected intradermally.
We assume at steady state that this holds too for MSI-H/dMMR CRC. Taking into account that only
e−dDτm of mature DCs that leave the TS, survive their migration to the TDLN, we have that
λDDLN
0.04edDτm =
dD
1 −0.04edDτm
Solving these simultaneously leads to
AD0 = 1.20 × 106  cell/cm3
day−1,
λDH = 2.04 × 10−1 day−1,
λDA = 4.07 × 10−2 day−1,
λDS = 2.04 × 10−2 day−1,
λD0K = 1.32 × 10−7  cell/cm3−1 day−1,
λDDLN = 1.71 × 10−2 day−1.
19
C.8.5
Estimates for CF
We consider (2.26) at steady state, which leads to

λCF + λCF Iβ
2
+ λCF I1β
2
 
1 −CF
CF 0

−dCF = 0.
We assume that TGF-β is more potent than IL-1β at promoting CAF growth in CRC, so that at
steady state
λCF Iβ
2 × 4 = λCF I1β
2 × 1 .
We assume that the carrying capacity of CAFs is 20% of its steady state, so that
CF 0 = 1.2CF = 1.12 × 107 cell/cm3.
The mean doubling time of CAFs in CRC was estimated to be 24 h in [71], so we set
λCF = ln 2
24 h = 6.93 × 10−1 d−1.
(C.4)
Solving these simultaneously leads to
λCF Iβ = 7.89 × 10−1 day−1,
λCF I1β = 1.97 × 10−1 day−1.
C.8.6
Estimates for N0/N1/N2
Adding (2.27), (2.28), and (2.29) at steady state leads to
AN0 −dN0N0 −dN1N1 −dN2N2 = 0 =⇒AN0 = 4.38 × 106  cell/cm3
day−1.
To estimate the other neutrophil production constants, we consider (2.27), (2.28), (2.29) at steady
state, and use the data from [72]. We assume that the magnitude of response to a specific cytokine
is proportional to its corresponding neutrophil polarisation rate, where the response is defined as the
Euclidean distance between the centroid vectors of cytokine-treated neutrophils and PBS-treated neu-
trophils.
Using values from [72], and considering (2.27), (2.28), and (2.29) at steady state leads to the equations
AN0 −λN1I1βN0

−λN1IγN0

2 × 23.05,
λN2I6
2 × 19.97 =
λN2Iβ
2 × 16.99.
20
Solving these simultaneously leads to
λN1I1β = 1.72 day−1,
λN1Iγ = 2.04 day−1,
λN2I6 = 4.06 day−1,
λN2Iβ = 3.46 day−1.
C.8.7
Estimates for M0/M1/M2
To estimate macrophage production parameters, we do a similar process to neutrophils. Adding (2.30),
(2.31), and (2.32) at steady state, leads to
AM0 −dM0M0 −dM1M1 −dM2M2 = 0 =⇒AM0 = 8.75 × 105  cell/cm3
day−1.
Using values from [72], and considering (2.30) at steady state, leads to the equations
AM0 −λM1IαM0
2
−λM1IγM0
2
−λM2I4M0
2
−λM2I10M0

−dM0M0 = 0,
λM1Iα

λM1Iγ
2 × 12.54 =
λM2I4
2 × 7.39 =
λM2I10
2 × 6.81.
We assume that TGF-β repolarises M1 macrophages to the M2 phenotype more potently than IL-6,
so that at steady state
λMIβ
2 × 5 = λMI6
2 × 1.
We also assume that IFN-γ repolarises M2 macrophages to the M1 phenotype slightly more potently
than TNF, which repolarises more slightly than IL-12. Hence, at steady state
λMIγ
2 × 6 = λMIα
2 × 5 = λMI12
2 × 1 .
At steady state, we assume that
λM1Iα/2 + λM1Iγ/2
M1
= λM2I4/2 + λM2I10/2 + λM2PL/2
M2
,
and that

Estimates for K0/K
To estimate NK cell production parameters, we do a similar process to neutrophils and macrophages.
Adding (2.33) and (2.34) at steady state, leads to
AK0 −dK0K0 −dKK = 0 =⇒AK0 = 3.82 × 105  cell/cm3

Using values from [72], and considering (2.34) at steady state, leads to the equations

We assume that mature DCs are more potent activators of NK cells than immature DCs so that at
steady state
λKD
2 × 5 = λKD0
2 × 1.
We finally assume that DC-mediated NK-cell activation is twice as potent as cytokine-induced activa-
tion at steady state, so that
λKD0/2 + λKD/2
2
= λKI2/2 + λKI12/2

Solving these simultaneously leads to

Cytokine Production Constants
To estimate many of the cytokine production constants, we consider (2.35) - (2.43) at steady state
and use the data from [72]. For each immune cell, we assume that each cytokine’s corresponding gene
expression is proportional to its production rate by that cell. We assume that the results for fibroblastic
reticular cells in [73] translate directly to results for CAFs, recalling that CAFs are considered to be
all fibroblasts found in the TME [73].

C.9.6
Estimates for I10
Amongst 48 different cell lines tested, it was found in [74], that cancer IL-10 production was maximised
in cell lines derived from colon carcinomas. As such, we assume that at steady state, cancer production
of IL-10 is equal to half of that by M2 macrophages. We assume that the enhancement factor of IL-2
for IL-10 production by Tregs is similar in CRC to that of inflammatory bowel disease, and use the
estimate of λI10I2 = 3 that was used in [75]. This, in conjunction with values from [72], and considering
(2.40) at steady state leads to the equations

TDLN subsystem constants
C.10.1
Estimate for VTS
The mean tumour volume in stage III colorectal patients was found to be 27.08 cm3 in [76]. We thus
set VLN = 2.71 × 101 cm3.
C.10.2
Estimate for VLN
The mean diameter of lymph nodes in CRC patients where cancer has metastasised was found to
be 5.6mm in [77]. Assuming a spherical lymph node, this corresponds to VLN = 4
3 × 2.83π mm3 =
9.20 × 10−2 cm3.
C.10.3
Estimate for τm
In [78], it took 18 hours for DCs, which acquired antigen from a site of subcutaneous injection to arrive
at the lymph node. We assume that this migration time is the same for DCs acquiring cancer antigens
from the TS so that τm = 18 h = 0.75 d.
C.10.4
Estimate for τa
To estimate τa, we note that T cells in the TDLN travel at speeds of 11˘14 µm/min, in comparison
to DCs which migrate at speeds of 3 – 6 µm/min [79]. We thus have that τa =
4.5
12.5τm ≈0.27 d.
C.10.5
Estimates for CD8+ T cells
It was found in [80] that activated CD8+ T cells required 39 hours on average to complete their first
cell division, and so we set ∆0
8 = 39 h = 1.63 d. Furthermore, the average division time for subsequent
cell cycles is 8.6 hours [80], however, can vary between 5 – 28 hours. Thus, we set ∆8 = 8.6 h = 0.36 d.
It was shown in [81], that fully activated CD8+ T cells divide a minimum of 7 – 10 times, however
can divide more if persistent antigen exposure is present. Indeed, in Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis
Virus (LCV), CD8+ T cells can divide more than 15 times [82]. We perform a compromise and set
n8
max = 10. We thus have that τT 8
A = 4.87 d. Finally, it is widely accepted that T cell exhaustion can
arise only days to weeks from the initial antigen exposure in the case of chronic antigen stimulation
[83, 84] so that we take τl = 10 d.
C.10.6
Estimates for Th1 and Th2 cells
For simplicity, we use the same parameters for Th1 and Th2 cells, noting that they are phenotypes
of CD4+ T helper cells. It was found in [85] that CD4 T cell priming takes between 1 – 2 days, and
so we set τ act
4
= 1.5 d. Compared to CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells appear to divide less, with only
approximately 9 cell divisions as in LCV [86]. We assume this is similar in MSI-H/dMMR CRC, and
so set n1
max = n2
max = 9. It takes between 12 and 24 hours for the first CD4+ T cell division to occur,
with subsequent divisions occurring at a rate of approximately 10 hours per cell division [87]. We thus
set ∆0
1 = ∆0
2 = 18.5 h = 0.77 d, and ∆1 = ∆2 = 10 h = 0.42 d. We thus have that τT 1
A = τT 2
A = 4.13 d.
C.10.7
Estimates for Tregs
We assume that the activation of Tregs takes the amount of time as that of CD4+ T helper cells so
that τ act
4
= 1.5 d. It was found in [88], that in mice, 6 days after tumour implantation, 45% of Tregs
26
in the TDLN had undergone at least 1 division, and 14% had undergone more than 6 divisions. We
thus set nr
max = 6 and assume that the cell division rates of Tregs and CD4+ T helper cells are the
same so that ∆0
r = 0.77 d and ∆r = 0.42 d. We thus have that τT r
A = 2.87 d.

Estimates for C and Nc
C.12.1
Estimates for C
Since CD8+ T cells are more effective at lysing cancer cells than Th1 cells, we approximate
λCT8/4
8
= λCT1.
We assume that CD8+ T cells and NK cells kill cancer cells with similar potency, so we approximate
λCK/4 = λCT8/4.
We also assume that the rate that TNF induces tumour necroptosis is larger than that for IFN-γ, so
we approximate
λCIα
2 × 5 = λCIγ
2 .
Via fitting to experimental data, it was found in [89] that the optimal C0 for colon cancer, where
logistic growth is assumed, is C0 = 8.02 × 108 cell/cm3, which we assume to be the case for CRC, and
this is consistent with the estimate in [90].
We note that not using the steady-state equation, (2.1), as part of the parameter estimation pro-
29
cess results in more accurate trajectories for the time period of interest. However, this may result in
reduced accuracy for trajectories extending significantly beyond this timeframe.
C.12.2
Estimates for Nc
Considering (2.2) at steady state leads to the equation
λCIαC
2
+ λCIγC
2
−dNcNc = 0.
C.12.3
Fitting λC, λCT8, and λCIα
We fit λC, λCT8, and λCIα by choosing the values such that the steady state value of C and Nc is
reached at 155 days, in particular ensuring that C and Nc reach steady state at exactly 155 days.
Furthermore, we expect monotonicity in the growth of the total cancer population (C + Nc), as the
cancer progresses without treatment, and so we aim to minimise the objective function
Objective = |C(155) −C|
C
+ |Nc(155) −Nc|
Nc
+
 max
t∈[0,155](C(t) + Nc(t)) −(C + Nc)

C + Nc
.
(C.6)
We use perform a parameter sweep to minimise (C.6), and set the parameter space to be λC ∈
(0 day−1, 2 day−1], λCT8 ∈(0 day−1, 1 × 10−6 day−1], and λCIα ∈(0 day−1, 1 day−1, ensuring that all
model parameters are positive. The optimal values of λC, λCT8, and λCIα were found to be
λC = 6.27 × 10−1 day−1,
λCT8 = 5.22 × 10−7  cell/cm3−1 day−1,
λCIα = 4.69 × 10−2 day−1,
which implies that
λCT1 = 1.63 × 10−8  cell/cm3−1 day−1,
λCK = 5.22 × 10−7  cell/cm3−1 day−1,
λCIγ = 9.38 × 10−3 day−1,
dNc = 5.34 × 10−1 day−1.
In particular, we observe that λC is rather consistent with [89] where λC, in the absence of immune
cells, was estimated to be 0.5775 in CRC.
