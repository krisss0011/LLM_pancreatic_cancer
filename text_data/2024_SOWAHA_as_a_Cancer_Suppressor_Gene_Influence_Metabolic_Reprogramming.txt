Abstract 
Background: SOWAHA, also known as ANKRD43, is related to embryonic development and is 
enriched in brain tissue, neuron, and intestinal enterocytes. Studies have indicated that SOWAHA 
is associated with the microsatellite instability (MSI) status in colorectal cancer patients and could 
serve as a prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer. However, there are 
rarely reports about SOWAHA in other types of cancer and the specific mechanism of SOWAHA in 
cancer is also not well understood. 
Methods: Based on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), cBioPortal, Human Protein Atlas 
(HPA), Integrative Onco Genomics (IntOGen), Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool 
(SMART), TIMER2, MethSurv, and TISIDB database, we uncovered the potential tumor genomic 
features of SOWAHA, including the correlation with prognosis, gene mutation, immune cell 
infiltration, and DNA methylation, and evaluated the association with tumor heterogeneity and 
stemness, chemokines chemokine receptors, and immunomodulators in pan-cancer. Besides, we 
knocked down SOWAHA in SW620 cells and performed RNA-seq analysis, then we conducted 
functional enrichment to uncover the biological significance of SOWAHA. 
Results: SOWAHA demonstrates early diagnostic potential, with low expression levels linked to 
poor prognosis in GBMLGG, KIPAN, READ, and other cancers. It is associated with immune cell 
infiltration, DNA methylation, tumor heterogeneity, and stemness in several epithelial cancers. 
Furthermore, our experiments revealed that SOWAHA is significantly enriched in the metabolic 
related pathways in cancer, such as 'P53', 'PI3K-AKT signaling pathway', and 'pathways in cancer', 
'Ubiquitin-Mediated Proteolysis', 'RNA Degradation', 'Sulfur Metabolism', 'Nucleotide Excision 
Repair'. We also identified two potential transcription factors regulating SOWAHA, TBX4 and 
FOXP2, which are misregulated in SW620 cells. 
Conclusion: SOWAHA, identified as a suppressor gene, may also serve as a valuable biomarker 
for diagnosis, prognosis, and immunotherapy in various carcinomas, particularly colorectal 
carcinoma. Its role in the progression of colorectal cancer is primarily mediated through metabolic 
reprogramming mechanisms. 
 
1. Introduction 
Cancer has become one of the major global health issues. In 2022, there were nearly 20 million new 
cancer cases and 9.7 million cancer-related deaths[1]. The ongoing rise in incidence and mortality 
rates of cancer poses a significant burden on public health. In recent years, targeted therapy and 
immunotherapy have emerged as new fields in cancer treatment. Targeted therapy aims to inhibit 
tumor growth and spread by targeting specific molecular markers in cancer cells, while minimizing 
damage to normal cells[2]. Immunotherapy, on the other hand, works by activating the patient’s own 
immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells, with new techniques such as immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy showing significant clinical efficacy[3]. Although 
targeted therapy and immunotherapy have provided new hope in cancer treatment, they still face 
challenges such as drug resistance, side effects, heterogeneity, and high costs[4, 5]. To address these 
issues, continued research is needed to explore new targets and immunotherapy strategies, while 
also improving existing treatment methods to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life. 
 
SOWAHA is a protein-coding gene, with the full name Sosondowah Ankyrin Repeat Domain Family 
Member A, also known as ANKRD43. SOWAHA belongs to the ankyrin repeat domain family, which 
is known for its ability to regulate protein-protein interactions, playing a key role in cell signaling, 
cell cycle control, cell adhesion, and other important biological processes[6].  
 
In recent years, studies have indicated that SOWAHA is associated with the MSI status in colorectal 
cancer patients and could serve as a prognostic biomarker for predicting the efficacy of 
immunotherapy in colorectal carcinoma[7]. There are also reports showing that SOWAHA is 
associated with prognosis in pancreatic carcinoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma[8, 9]. However, 
there are no reports on SOWAHA in other cancers. The specific mechanism of action of SOWAHA 
in cancer is also not well understood. 
 
We conducted an extensive pan-cancer analysis of SOWAHA, investigating its aberrant expression, 
DNA mutations, DNA methylation, immune infiltration including chemokines and receptors, and 
its association with immunomodulators. We elucidated the significant influence of SOWAHA on 
tumor prognosis and its capacity to impact the immune response. Remarkably, we also knocked 
down SOWAHA in SW620 cell line and then performed RNA-seq, differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) were greatly enriched in many enzymes activity and metabolism processes, and negatively 
related with pathways of metabolic reprogramming in cancer, such as 'P53 signaling pathways', 
'PI3K-AKT signaling pathway,' 'pathways in cancer', 'Ubiquitin-Mediated Proteolysis', 'RNA 
Degradation', 'Sulfur Metabolism', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair'. Besides, CCK-8 assay results 
showed that the cells proliferation and viability in siSOWAHA groups is better than siNC groups. 
These discoveries underscore the potential of SOWAHA as a cancer suppressor gene, whose 
dysregulation may influence the development of carcinoma. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Data collection  
Gene expression data, clinical data, mutation data, and methylation data of SOWAHA for 45 types 
of cancer and their corresponding normal tissues were downloaded in UCSC Xena database (https 
://xena.ucsc.edu/)[10], TCGA (https://www.cancer.gov/tcga)[11], GTEx database 
(https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs/genotype-Tissue-Expression-Project)[12], cBioPortal 
database (http://www.cbioportal.org/)[13], and Human Protein Atlas 
(https://www.proteinatlas.org/)[14, 15]. The full names and abbreviations of the 45 cancer types 
are shown in Table 1. 
 
2.2 Differential Expression Analysis of SOWAHA 
The mRNA expression of SOWAHA in various cancer tissues, different clinical stages, and paired 
adjacent normal tissues was investigated using the Sangerbox platform (http://sangerbox.com 
/home.html)[16], excluding cancers with fewer than three samples per cancer type. Differential 
expression results were obtained using Wilcoxon tests. Additionally, the open-access proteomic 
tool, The Human Protein Atlas, was employed to analyze the protein expression of SOWAHA 
across different tumor types, with representative immunohistochemical images of SOWAHA 
provided using the antibody (catalog number: HPA064621; Atlas Antibodies, Sigma–Aldrich). 
 
2.3 Prognosis Analysis of SOWAHA 
First, gene expression and clinical data were obtained from TCGA and GTEx. Then univariate 
survival analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model to assess the relationship 
between gene expression and Overall survival (OS), Disease-specific survival (DSS), and 
Progression-free interval (PFI) using 'survival' R package. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) was calculated for each outcome. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated and 
performed log-rank tests to evaluate significance between high expression groups and low gene 
expression groups. Visualization of results were generated using 'survfit' and 'ggsurvplot' R package.  
 
2.3 Genetic alterations analysis of SOWAHA 
The IntOGen (IntOGen - Cancer Mutations Browser) tool[17] was utilized to obtain the distribution 
of the observed mutations along the mutation related amino acid sequence. The cBioPortal 
(cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics) was employed to investigate the mutation of SOWAHA across 
different cancer types. The Copy number alteration (CNA) of SOWAHA in pan-cancer was observed 
and analysis by Sangerbox. 
 
2.4 Correlation Analysis Between SOWAHA and High-Frequency Mutation Genes 
The correlation between SOWAHA expression and high-frequency mutation genes expression was 
assessed using the Cancer Exploration module of TIMER2.0 (http://timer.cistrome.org/)[18]. 
Specifically, we evaluated the relationship between SOWAHA and the expression of wild-type 
(WT) and mutated forms of EGFR, PIK3CA, MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH4, MSH6, TP53, and 
KRAS across various cancers. 
 
2.5 Analysis of SOWAHA DNA Methylation 
The SMART platform (http://www.bioinfo-zs.com/smartapp/) [19]was used to analyze the 
correlation between SOWAHA expression and DNA methylation. We utilized the 'CpG-aggregated 
methylation' module to calculate the SOWAHA methylation levels in pan-cancer and a box plot 
represents the results. The MethSurv web tool (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/methsurv/) [20]was used to 
perform multivariable survival analysis based on DNA methylation data.  
 
2.6 Correlation analysis of SOWAHA and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) 
The correlation of SOWAHA expression and TIME can be analyzed using the ESTIMATE 
(Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumor tissues using Expression data) 
algorithm. The ESTIMATE algorithm is designed to predict the presence of stromal and immune 
cells in tumor tissues using gene expression data, and it generates three key scores: stroma, immune, 
and estimate scores. The 'estimate" R package and Spearman correlation test were used to calculate 
stroma, immune, and estimate scores for each patient in each tumor based on gene expression. The 
results were then visualized using the 'ggplot2' R packages. 
 
2.7 Correlation analysis of SOWAHA with immune infiltration cells 
We used the TISIDB web tool (http://cis.hku.hk/TISIDB/search.php)[21] to analyze the effect of 
SOWAHA expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) across various cancers. The 
correlation between SOWAHA expression and infiltration degree of 28 immune cell types was 
explored using Spearman correlation analysis, including active T cell(ActCD8+, ActCD4+), Central 
Memory T cell (TcmCD8+, TcmCD4+), Effector Memory T cell (TemCD8+, TemCD4+), regulatory T cell 
(Treg), Th1, Th2, active B cell(Act B), immature B cell (Imm B), memory B cell(Mem B), natural 
killer(NK), CD56(bright/dim) NK, Myeloid dendritic cell, natural killer (NK), natural killer T 
cell(NKT), Myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC), active Dendritic Cell (Act DC), plasmacytoid 
dendritic cells (pDC), immature Dendritic Cell (iDC), macrophage, monocyte, eosinophil, mast cell, 
and neutrophil. The results are presented as a heatmap.  
Additionally, the correlation between SOWAHA (including SOWAHA mutations and methylation) 
and major histocompatibility complex (MHC), immunomodulators, chemokines, and chemokine 
receptors genes were visualized as heatmaps using TISIDB. 
 
2.8 Association analysis between SOWAHA with tumor heterogeneity and stemness 
To calculate the DNA methylation based Stemness Scores (DNAss) and RNA based Stemness Score 
(RNAss) of SOWAHA in tumors, we utilized sangerbox 'Tumor stemness and gene expression’ 
module, resulting in the final dataset comprising 37 types of cancer. Pearson correlation was then 
tested for each tumor, and the results were visualized using a lollipop chart. To investigate the link 
between SOWAHA expression and with tumor mutation burden (TMB)[22], Microsatellite 
Instability (MSI)[23], tumor neoantigen (NEO)[24], and Homologous Recombination Deficiency 
(HRD)[25], we utilized sangerbox 'Genomic heterogeneity and gene expression analysis' 
Module. Pearson’s correlation was applied, and the results were visualized using a lollipop chart. 
 
2.9 Cell lines and cultures 
The colorectal cancer SW620 cell line was obtained from Tsinghua University. The cells were 
cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco, ThermoFisher, China) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin-
streptomycin (HyClone, Utah, USA) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ExCell, China) at 37°C in 
a 5% CO₂ incubator. 
 
2.10 Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8 assay) 
To assess cell viability after knocking down SOWAHA, we conduct a CCK-8 assay 72 hours post-
transfection. Begin by seeding 7000 cells in a 96-well plate and allow them to adhere for 24 hours. 
The CCK-8 experiment was performed 72 hours after SOWAHA knockdown. Add the CCK-8 
reagent and incubate for 2 hours at 37°C. Finally, measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a 
microplate reader. Analyze the results to determine the impact of the gene knockdown on cell 
viability. 
 
2.11 siRNA reverse transfection assay 
SOWAHA-siRNA (siSOWAHA) and NC-siRNA (siNC) were purchased from GenePharma 
(Shanghai, China), and mixed with transfection reagent (DharmaFECT1, Dharmacon Reagents, 
USA) and allowed to stand for 30 minutes. The resulting mixture was evenly distributed across the 
bottom of a 10 cm plate, into which 7 × 10⁵ cells were seeded. After 72 hours of transfection, total 
mRNA was extracted to assess the transfection efficiency of the siRNA. The siRNA sequences of 
SOWAHA siRNA and negative control are as follows: 
SOWAHA siRNA-1: AGAAAUCUCUCGUCGACCUTT; 
SOWAHA siRNA-2: CUGCCAACAGAGCCACAGGTT; 
SOWAHA siRNA-3: GAAACCCACUUCGACGGUCTT; 
Negative control siRNA: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT. 
 
2.12 Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (q-PCR) 
RNA extraction was performed using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA), ensuring high-quality RNA 
with minimal contamination. The extracted RNA was then reverse transcribed into complementary 
DNA (cDNA) using the HiScript II Q RT SuperMix for q-PCR kit (Vazyme, China). Quantitative 
PCR (q-PCR) was conducted using real-time fluorescence to measure gene expression levels using 
ChamQ Universal SYBR q-PCR Master Mix (Vazyme, China), with β-actin serving as the reference 
gene. Data analysis was conducted using the 2^(-ΔΔCT) method. The forward and reverse primers 
used are as follows:  
SOWAHA-Forward primer 5’-3’: CTTCAAGCAGTTCGTCAACAAC; 
SOWAHA-Reverse primer 5’-3’: AAGACCGTCGAAGTGGGTTTC. 
β-actin-Forward primer 5’-3’: CATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGC;  
β-actin -Reverse primer 5’-3’: CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGAT. 
 
2.13 RNA-seq experiments 
RNA-seq was performed on SW620 cell samples treated with siNC and siSOWAHA. RNA was 
extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Evaluate the quality and 
purity of the RNA using devices like the Bioanalyzer or Nanodrop, ensuring an RIN value above 
7.0. Reverse transcription high-quality RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) using a reverse 
transcriptase enzyme. Fragment the cDNA and add adapter sequences to create a library suitable for 
high-throughput sequencing. The sequencing library was then subjected to transcriptome 
sequencing on an Illumina Novaseq™ 6000 platform (LC-Bio Technologies (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd, 
China), with a minimum depth of 20,000 reads per cell. FASTQ reads from Illumina sequencing 
were mapped to the human genome reference GRCh38 using HiSat2[26]. Gene expression changes 
were analyzed with DESeq2, and differential expression was determined using cut-offs of p < 0.05 
and | log2 fold-change (log2FC) | > 1. 
 
2.14 Gene enrichment analysis  
DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/)[27] was used to perform Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, 
Disease Ontology (DO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), extracting the 
top 20 or 30 terms for GO, DO, and KEGG. The results were visualized using the 'ggplot2' package 
in R. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted via 'clusterProfiler' package. Besides, 
the 'cytoHubba' module of Cytoscape was used to identify the top 10 hub genes. Besides, the 
different alternative splicing (AS) genes were conducted KEGG and GSEA analysis using DAVID 
and visualized using R. 
 
2.15 Transcription factor (TF) binding sites prediction 
RNA-seq results revealed four differentially expressed transcription factors (log2FC > 1). Using 
NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), we identified the promoter sequence of SOWAHA in the 
1.91 kb region from base 132,816,876 to 132,818,786. We then applied the 'scan' module in JASPAR 
(https://jaspar.genereg.net/) with a relative profile score threshold of 90% to identify transcription 
factor binding motifs within the SOWAHA promoter. 
 
2.16 Statistical analysis 
All data in this study was calculated, analyzed, and graphed using R software and GraphPad Prism 
10. Gene expression differences are compared using either the Wilcoxon test or one-way ANOVA. 
The correlation between two groups is calculated using Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis. 
The log-rank test is employed to calculate significant differences in prognosis analysis. Student's t-
test was used for the statistical analysis of q-PCR data. Significance levels are defined as follows: 
p< 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***), and p < 0.0001 (****). 
 
3. Results  
3.1 SOWAHA is significantly low expressed in 12 types of cancers and high expressed in 14 
types of cancers 
The mRNA expression of SOWAHA shows significant differences in various cancers. Specifically, 
SOWAHA was significantly low expressed in 12 types of cancer, including GBM, GBMLGG, LGG, 
KIRP, KIPAN, PRAD, KIRP, WT, SKCM, READ, TGCT, and KICH. SOWAHA was highly 
expressed in 14 types of cancer, including BRCA, CESC, ESCA, STES, COAD, COADREAD, 
STAD, LUSC, LIHC, THCA, OV, PAAD, UC, and PCPG (Figure 1A).  In addition, the expression 
of SOWAHA across different TNM stages in 26 types of cancers and normal tissues was investigated. 
The results revealed significant differences in SOWAHA expression in 9 cancer types: LUAD, 
COAD, COADREAD, BRCA, ESCA, KIRP, KIPAN, HNSC, and PAAD (Figure 1B). Notably, 
these cancers are all of epithelial origin. Immunohistochemical images of SOWAHA in various 
cancers and normal tissues were retrieved from the HPA database. The protein expression of 
SOWAHA protein is lower in tumor than in normal tissue in almost all cancer types, such as 
KIRC(Figure 1C), GBM(Figure 1D), LGG (Figure 1D), COAD (Figure 1E), LIHC (Figure 1F), OV 
(Figure 1G), THCA (Figure 1H), and BRCA (Figure S1B), PRAD (Figure S1CC), TGCT (Figure 
S1D), CESC(Figure S1E), STAD(Figure S1FF),UCEC(Figure S1G), LUAD(Figure S1H), 
BLCA(Figure S1I), HNSC(Figure S1J), SKCM(Figure S1K), DLBC(Figure S1L), THCA(Figure 
S1M). 
According to The Human Protein Atlas, the mRNA of SOWAHA is predominantly expressed in the 
brain, mainly in neuron, with a Tau specificity score of 0.84, indicating a high level of expression 
specificity in this tissue. However, it is also distributed across various other tissues, with cell type 
enrichment observed in colon enterocytes, respiratory ciliated cells in the lung, and thyroid 
glandular cells.  
 
3.2 The expression of SOWAHA has significant correlation with the prognosis of cancer 
patients 
A Cox hazards regression model was used to assess the association between SOWAHA gene 
expression and OS, DSS, and PFI with each tumor type. High expression of SOWAHA exhibited a 
notably poor prognosis with ACC and MESO, and low expression SOWAHA was notably associated 
with a poor prognosis of patients in KIPAN, GBMLGG, PAAD, UVM, KIRP, READ, HNSC, 
THYM, and THCA (Figure 2A). Kaplan-Meier survival plots showed significant correlation 
between high expression of SOWAHA and poor prognosis in ACC and MESO (Figure 2B-C). A 
significant correlation was observed between low SOWAHA expression and poor prognosis in 
KIPAN, GBMLGG, PAAD, HNSC, THCA, and READ (Figure 2D-I).  
In addition, high expression of SOWAHA is significantly correlated with an unfavorable prognosis 
of DSS in 2 types of cancer patients: ACC, and MESO, and low expression of SOWAHA is 
significantly correlated with unfavorable prognosis of DSS in 9 tumor types: KIPAN, KIRP, 
GBMLGG, THYM, PAAD, UVM, HNSC, BRCA, and COADREAD (Figure S2A). High 
expression of SOWAHA is significantly correlated with an unfavorable prognosis of PFI in ACC, 
and low expression of SOWAHA is significantly correlated with unfavorable prognosis of PFI in 
PAAD, KIRP, GBMLGG, PCPG, BRCA, SKCM, SKCM-M, HNSC, and UVM (Figure S2B). 
Interestingly, all cancer types that show a significant correlation between low SOWAHA expression 
and poor prognosis are epithelial in origin, including GBMLGG, which arise from neuroepithelial 
cells in embryology. 
 
3.3 SOWAHA displays mutations across 23 different cancer types 
The predominant forms of mutations in SOWAHA were missense (53%) and synonymous (32%) 
mutations (Figure 3A), with KIRC (5.28%), UCS (5.26%), and CHOL (2.78%) being the most 
frequently affected cancer types (Figure 3B). The CNA types of SOWAHA are significantly different 
in GBMLGG, LGG, LUAD, BRCA, KIPAN, STAD, PAAD, OV, PCPG, and UCS (Figure 3C). 
 
3.4 SOWAHA is low expressed in multiple cancer driver genes mutation types of cancer 
SOWAHA is under expressed in EGFR-mutated COAD and LUSC, but overexpressed in EGFR-
mutated GBM (Figure 4A-C). In PIK3CA-mutated cancers, SOWAHA shows low expression in 
COAD but elevated levels in BRCA, including BRCA-LumA and BRCA-LumB subtypes (Figure 
4D-G). SOWAHA expression is reduced in MLH1-mutated COAD, BRCA-LumB, and SKCM 
(Figure 4H-J), as well as in MSH2-mutated COAD and LUSC (Figure 4K-L). Additionally, 
SOWAHA is downregulated in PMS2, MSH4, and MSH6-mutated COAD (Figure 4M-O). 
Interestingly, SOWAHA is overexpressed in TP53-mutated BRCA-LumB, COAD, STAD, and 
UCEC, but downregulated in BRCA, HNSC, HNSC+HPV, GBM, and LGG (Figure S3A-I). Lastly, 
SOWAHA exhibits lower expression in KRAS-mutated COAD, PAAD, TGCT, UCEC, BLCA, and 
STAD (Figure S3J-O). 
 
3.5 SOWAHA methylation at different sites correlates variably with cancer patient survival 
We analyzed SOWAHA DNA methylation levels in tumor and normal tissues, revealing significant 
differences in SOWAHA methylation in pan-cancer. The methylation levels of SOWAHA promoter 
were significantly increased in BLCA, BRCA, CESC, COAD, ESCA, HNSC, KIRC, KIRP, LIHC, 
LUAD, LUSC, PRAD, SKCM, THCA, and UCEC patient tissues. (Figure 5A).  
The 1st exon represents a crucial region for gene transcription. When this site undergoes heavy 
methylation, it can obstruct transcription initiation, potentially altering gene expression, particularly 
in diseases like cancer. There is significant negative correlation between 1stExon-Island-
cg02699218 methylation of SOWAHA and the survival probability of ACC, MESO, READ (Figure 
5B-D), and UCEC, SKCM, and SARC (Figure S4G-I), but is significant positive correlation with 
BRCA, and UVM (Figure S4J-K). There is significant negative correlation between 1stExon-island-
cg01435564 and 1stExon-island-cg04044664 methylation of SOWAHA and survival probability of 
ACC, MESO, and READ (Figure 5E-J). Besides, there is significant positive correlation between 
1stExon-island-cg01435564 methylation of SOWAHA and survival probability of UVM and BLCA 
(Figure S4A-B). There is significant negative correlation between 1stExon-island-cg04044664 
methylation of SOWAHA and survival probability of COAD, PAAD, and UCEC (Figure S4C-E), 
while opposite in STAD (FigureS4F). In addition, there is significant negative correlation between 
1stExon-island-cg26399201 methylation of SOWAHA and survival probability of UCEC 
(FigureS4L). 
Methylation in the TSS200 region is typically associated with gene silencing. Elevated methylation 
levels in this area can inhibit the binding of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, thus 
reducing gene expression. We observed a significant positive correlation between TSS200-Island-
cg26066519 methylation of SOWAHA and survival probability in BRCA and LGG (Figure S5A-B), 
while an opposite trend was noted in BLCA, MESO, and SARC (Figure S5C-E). Additionally, there 
was a significant negative correlation between TSS200-Island-cg12923585 methylation of 
SOWAHA and survival probability in BLCA, UCEC, LGG, and UVM (Figure S5F-I), whereas the 
trend was reversed in ACC, GBM, and LAML (Figure S5J-L). Lastly, TSS200-Island-cg18840461 
methylation of SOWAHA showed a significant negative association with survival probability in 
PAAD and UVM (Figure S5M-N), while the contrary was observed in SKCM (Figure S5O). 
 
3.6 SOWAHA expression shows significant correlation with Immune Infiltration Score across 
cancer types 
The immune infiltration score reflects the impact of the immune system on the tumor 
microenvironment by calculating the proportion or quantity of different types of immune cells in 
tumor or tissue samples. We utilized ESTIMATE to calculate the StromalScore, ImunneScore, and 
ESTIMATEScore, and found that the expression of SOWAHA was significantly correlated with 
immune infiltration in 26 cancer species, of which 4 were significantly positively correlated in 
ESTIMATEScore, namely NB, LIHC, HNSC, and BRCA. There were 15 significant negative 
correlations, namely ALL-R, ACC, PCPG, TGCT, WT, BLCA, STAD, COADREAD, COAD, 
KIPAN, KIRP, ESCA, CESC, LGG, and GBMLGG. and SKCM-P (Figure 6A). Interestingly, 
SOWAHA is positively correlation with StromalScore, ImunneScore, and ESTIMATEScore in GBM, 
but is significantly negative correlation with StromalScore, ImunneScore, and ESTIMATEScore in 
LGG and GBMLGG, which suggests SOWAHA has distinct biological functions across different 
stages or types of gliomas. The detail of the correlation between SOWAHA expression and 
StromalScore, ImmuneScore and ESTIMATEScore for GBMLGG, KIPAN, and ACC is shown in 
Figure 6B-J. 
 
3.7 Significantly association between SOWAHA expression, CNA, methylation and TIIC 
across 30 types of cancer 
To explore the function of SOWAHA in the TME, we assessed the relationship between SOWAHA 
expression and TIIC. The results showed that SOWAHA is negatively associated with infiltration of 
CD8+T cells, CD4+ T cells, Tfh, Tgd, Treg, macrophages, eosinophils, Th1, Th2, B cells, NK cells, 
mast cells, monocytes, and neutropils in the majority cancer types (Figure 7A). Furthermore, 
SOWAHA is positively associated with the Th17 in many types of cancer, especially in ESCA. 
Besides, the correlation between CNA of SOWAHA and TIIC is generally positive compared to the 
correlation observed between SOWAHA and TIIC, and CNA of SOWAHA is positively associated 
with all immune cells except MemB in ESCA, GBM, HNSC, LUSC, LUAD, STAD, TGCT, and 
UVM, while the correlation between CNA of SOWAHA and TIIC is negative in ACC (Figure 7B).  
While methylation of SOWAHA is strong positively associated with almost all immune cells in ACC, 
BLCA, CESC, CHOL, and LUSC, but is opposite in KIRP, LGG, and PRAD (Figure 7C). 
 
3.8 SOWAHA is negative correlation with multiple MHC-related genes 
Cancer cells evade immune detection by downregulating MHC molecule expression or modifying 
antigen presentation mechanisms to facilitate immune escape (35). To investigate the link between 
SOWAHA and MHC genes, we analyzed the correlation between SOWAHA and MHC-related genes. 
Our results revealed that SOWAHA expression is negatively correlated with all MHC-related genes 
in ACC, BLCA, KIRP, LGG, PAAD, TGCT, and UVM, but shows the opposite trend in KICH and 
UCS (Figure 7D). Next, we assessed the relationship between the CNA of SOWAHA and MHC 
genes, finding that CNA of SOWAHA is positively associated with nearly all MHC genes across 
most cancer types, except in ACC and KIRC (Figure 7E). Additionally, SOWAHA methylation levels 
are positively correlated with MHC-related genes in ACC, BLCA, CESC, COAD, LUAD, LUSC, 
READ, SKCM, STAD, TGCT, UCEC, UCS, and UVM, but display an inverse correlation in KICH, 
LGG, and PRAD (Figure 7F). 
 
3.9 SOWAHA is negative relation with many chemokines and receptors 
We investigated the relationship between SOWAHA and chemokines, as well as their receptors, in 
pan-cancer. The results revealed that SOWAHA is positively correlated with CCL15 and CCL28 
across various cancer types, but negatively correlated with many other chemokines in multiple 
cancers, except in ESCA and TGCT (Figure S6A). The CNA of SOWAHA is positively correlated 
with nearly all chemokines in LUSC and TGCT, while a weak correlation was observed between 
the CNA of SOWAHA and CCL1, CCL16, CCL24, CCL25, and CCL26 in most cancers (Figure 
S6B). The methylation of SOWAHA shows a minimal correlation with CCL1 in nearly all cancer 
types but is positively correlated with CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8, CCL13, CCL14, CXCL9, 
CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, XCL1, and XCL2 in ACC, BLCA, CESC, CHOL, and COAD 
(Figure S6C). SOWAHA shows weak correlation with CCR3, CCR9, and XCR1 in most cancers, 
but is positively correlated with CCR6 in the majority of cancers, except ACC (Figure S6D). The 
CNA of SOWAHA is weakly correlated with CCR3 and CCR9 in most cancers but shows a positive 
correlation with almost all chemokine receptors in HNSC, LUSC, and STAD (Figure S6E). 
Furthermore, SOWAHA methylation is weakly related to CCR3, CCR9, and XCR1 in most cancers, 
yet significantly positively correlated with most chemokine receptors in ACC, BLCA, CESC, 
CHOL, and LUAD. Additionally, SOWAHA methylation is strongly positively correlated with 
CCR6 and CCR8 in OV (Figure S6F). 
 
3.10 The expression of SOWAHA is significantly associated with tumor stemness 
We observed there is significant correlation between SOWAHA and the DNA methylation based 
Stemness Scores (DNAss)[28] in 12 types of tumors, with 5 showing significant positive 
correlations, such as LUAD, STAD, PRAD, THCA, and PCPG, and 7 showing significant negative 
correlations, such as GBMLGG, CESC, BRCA, KIRP, KIPAN, PAAD, and TGCT (Figure 8A). 
There is significant correlation between SOWAHA and the RNA based Stemness Scores (RNAss)[29] 
17 tumor types, with 7 showing significant positive correlations, such as GBMLGG, LGG, ESCA, 
KIPAN, LIHC, PCPG, ACC, while 10 showing significant negative correlations, including LUAD, 
BRCA, SARC, PRAD, THYM, THCA, MESO, TGCT, SKCM, and UVM (Figure 8B).  
 
3.11 The expression of SOWAHA is significantly associated with tumor heterogeneity 
We observed the expression of SOWAHA is significantly associated with TMB in 8 types of tumors, 
with 2 showing significant positive correlations, such as ESCA and CHOL, and 6 showing 
significant negative correlations, such as CESC, COAD, COADREAD, PRAD, LUSC, and READ 
(Figure 8C). The expression of SOWAHA is significantly associated with MSI in 10 types of tumors, 
with 4 showing significant positive correlations, such as GBMLGG, KIPAN, TGCT, and SKCM, 
and 6 showing significant negative correlations, such as COAD, COADREAD, BRCA, STAD, 
PRAD, and HNSC (Figure 8D). The expression of SOWAHA is significantly associated with HRD 
in 14 types of tumors, with 8 significant positive correlations, such as COAD, STES, STAD, UCEC, 
HNSC, LIHC, BLCA, and ACC, and 6 significant negative correlations, such as GBM, GBMLGG, 
LGG, BRCA, PAAD, and KICH (Figure 8E). Significant correlations were observed between 
SOWAHA expression and NEO in 6 types of tumors, with 1 showing a significant positive 
correlation, CHOL, and 5 showing significant negative correlations, such as GBM, COAD, 
COADREAD, BRCA, and HNSC (Figure 8F). 
 
3.12 SOWAHA positively correlates with many immune inhibitors and stimulators 
We investigated the correlation between SOWAHA expression and immunoinhibitors and observed 
that SOWAHA negatively correlates with many inhibitors in multiple cancer types, but is 
significantly positive corelated with PVRL2 in ESCA, and significantly positive correlated with 
TGFBR1 in THCA. But SOWAHA expression is low corelated with KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL3 in 
almost all cancer types (Figure S7A). The same situation is also observed in the correlation of CNA 
of SOWAHA, methylation of SOWAHA and immunoinhibitors (Figure S7B). The CNA of SOWAHA 
is positively correlates with many inhibitors in multiple cancer types. The methylation of SOWAHA 
is positively related to many immunomodulators in majority cancer types, except LGG and PRAD 
(Figure S7C). 
We investigated the correlation between SOWAHA expression and immunostimulators and observed 
that SOWAHA is significantly positive related to HHLA2 and TNFRSF14, TNFSF13, TNFSF15, in 
ESCA. But SOWAHA is minimal corelated with all immunostimulators in MESO ((Figure S7D). 
The CNA of SOWAHA is positively correlated with many immunositimulators, especially in LUSC, 
and STAD ((Figure S7E). The methylation of SOWAHA is strong positive correlated with almost all 
immunostimulators in ACC, BLCA, CESC, CHOL, COAD, LUAD, and is strong positive 
association with TNFRSF8, and TNFRSF9 in OV (Figure S7F). 
 
3.13 Function analysis revealed that SOWAHA is significantly connected with metabolic 
pathways in carcinoma  
We knocked down SOWAHA in the SW620 cell line using siRNA, achieving a knockdown 
efficiency of over 90% (Figure 9A). RNA-seq was then performed on siSOWAHA samples along 
with siNC samples. Compared to siNC, SOWAHA knockdown resulted in 54 significantly 
upregulated genes and 70 significantly downregulated genes (Figure 9B-C). KEGG pathway 
enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment in pathways: 'Cytokine-cytokine receptor 
interaction', 'PI3K-AKT signaling pathway', 'Pathways in cancer', 'NF-kappa B signaling pathway'. 
Besides, 'Breast cancer', 'Small cell lung cancer', 'Melanoma' are also significantly enriched. (Figure 
9D). 
GO enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were primarily enriched in 'pallium development', 
'Trans-1,2-dehydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase activity', 'indanol dehydrogenase activity', 
'oxidoreductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H, quinone' and many metabolic pathways. Additionally, 
'T cell migration' and the 'fibroblast apoptosis process' were also enriched (Figure10A). DO 
enrichment analysis results indicated that 'gastrointestinal lymphoma,' 'gastrointestinal system 
cancer,' and 'congenital nervous system abnormalities,' among others, were significantly enriched 
(Figure 10B). DO-based GSEA analysis revealed that significantly upregulation in 'hereditary 
Wilms' tumor', 'acute leukemia', 'pancreas disease', 'sarcoma', 'multiple myeloma', and 
downregulation in 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma', and 'colonic disease', among others (Figure 
10C).   
GSEA analysis revealed significantly upregulation in 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) Anchor 
Biosynthesis', 'P53 signaling pathway', 'Ubiquitin-Mediated Proteolysis', 'RNA Degradation', 'Sulfur 
Metabolism', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', and 'Basal Transcription factors' (Figure 10D). In 
addition, the 10 hub genes are respectfully FGF8, FGF18, CXCL8, CSF3, NT5E, TGFB2, CCND1, 
CXCL1, CX3CL1, and APOE (Figure10G). 
 
3.14 TBX4 and FOXP2 may bind to the promoter of SOWAHA  
By RNA-seq, we identified four transcription factors with differential expression (log2FC > 1): 
FOXP2, ZFP91-CNTF, PAX6, and TBX4 (Figure 9E). We used JASPAR to predict their binding 
motifs for SOWAHA and found that TBX4 and FOXP2 can bind to the promoter of SOWAHA (Table 
2, Figure 9G). FOXP2 is upregulated in siSOWAHA samples, while TBX4 is downregulated in these 
samples. Additionally, FOXP2 underwent a Skipped Exon (SE) event compared to siNC. 
 
3.15 KEGG analysis of AS indicated SOWAHA is connected with carcinoma  
The types of alternative splicing (AS) observed in the differentially expressed samples, including 
Alternative 3' Splice Site (A3S), Alternative 5' Splice Site (A5S), Mutually Exclusive Exons (MXE), 
Retained Intron (RI), and Skipped Exon (SE), are shown in Figure 9F. Among these, SE and MXE 
are the predominant AS types, having the greatest impact on gene function. KEGG analysis of AS 
genes indicated significant terms are 'Viral carcinogenesis', 'autophagy-animal', 'RNA Transport', 
'EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance', 'Pyrimidine metabolism', etc. (Figure 10E). KEGG-
based GSEA of all AS genes were primarily significant enriched in 'P53 signaling pathway', 'Cell 
cycle', 'RNA Degradation', 'sulfur metabolism', 'basal transcription factors' (Figure10F). 
 
3.16 The enhanced proliferation of SW620 cells after SOWAH knockdown 
Under the microscope, SW620 cells with SOWAHA knockdown appeared more densely packed, 
with a more spread-out and uniform morphology, suggesting enhanced growth and proliferation 
(Figure 10H). CCK-8 assay results showed that the cells proliferation and viability in siSOWAHA 
groups is better than siNC groups (Figure 10I). 
 
Discussion 
The mRNA expression of SOWAHA is significantly different expressed in 26 types of cancer. Bu 
the protein expression of SOWAHA in these cancer types is lower than the normal tissue. Low 
expression of SOWAHA is significantly correlated with unfavorable prognosis of OS, DSS, and PFI 
in epithelial cancer types. The low expression of SOWAHA is associated with cancer progression, 
suggesting that it may have a role in suppressing cancer progression under normal conditions. 
Besides, knockdown of SOWAHA in SW620 cells exhibited better growth, these indicates that 
SOWAHA is a cancer suppressor gene in COAD. 
 
The significant discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression levels of SOWAHA in SW620 
cell line may be influenced by factors such as translation regulation and epigenetic modulation. GO 
analysis results indicated SOWAHA is significantly related with activity of many enzymes and 
metabolism processes, and the results of KEGG and GSEA analysis showed that SOWAHA is related 
with many signaling pathways in cancer. DO analysis results showed it is significantly enriched in 
'gastrointestinal lymphoma', 'gastrointestinal system cancer', and 'congenital nervous system 
abnormality', etc. Knockdown of SOWAHA resulted in the different expression of many AS genes, 
which is associated with multiple cancer-related pathways, such as 'Viral carcinogenesis', 
'autophagy-animal', 'EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance', etc. GSEA enrichment analyses of 
these genes revealed significant enrichment in various cancer-related metabolic reprogramming 
pathways, such as GPI anchor biosynthesis, Cell cycle, P53 pathway, PI3K-AKT pathway, RNA 
degradation, Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, Basal transcription factors, and Nucleotide excision 
repair. 
 
In cancer cells, abnormal expression or activity changes of certain transcription factors may affect 
the binding of splicing factors and the selection of splicing sites, potentially leading to alterations 
in splicing patterns[30].Our research found 2 potential transcription factors of SOWAHA, T-box 
transcription factor-4 (TBX4), and Forkhead Box P2 (FOXP2), both are biomarker in some cancer 
types. TBX4, a member of the T-box transcription factor family, plays a crucial role in both 
embryonic development and cancer[31]. During embryonic development, TBX4 is essential for the 
proper formation of lower limbs and the development of the lungs[32]. The expression of TBX4 can 
become dysregulated in cancer. Abnormal levels of TBX4 have been observed in various cancers, 
including LUSC, BRCA, and CHOL[33-35]. In these cancers, TBX4 may contribute to tumor 
progression by affecting cell proliferation and invasion[36].  
 
FOXP2 is crucial for the development of the nervous system during embryogenesis[37]. It regulates 
the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons, influencing the formation of the brain 
and spinal cord[38]. Its abnormal expression may affect normal neural development, potentially 
indirectly promoting the progression of neurodevelopmental cancers[39]. It has been reported that 
SOWAHA is involved in embryonic development in chicken embryo[40]. Our research found 
SOWAHA is significantly corelated with pallium development, and transcriptional misregulation in 
cancer, and glioma, COAD, BRCA, LUSC, STAD, etc. Some studies suggest that FOXP2 may play 
a role in the progression of GBM[39, 41], COAD[33] , BRCA[42], LUSC[43], STAD[44], etc., but 
the specific mechanisms and functions are still under investigation. Our findings provide a reference 
for this issue.  
 
SOWAHA is expressed at low levels in several cancer types associated with driver mutations, 
particularly in COAD. DNA methylation of SOWAHA shows positive correlations with TIIC and 
MHC, and is significantly associated with poor prognosis across various cancers. Additionally, 
SOWAHA expression is notably linked with tumor heterogeneity and stemness in multiple cancer 
types. Besides, SOWAHA is significantly associated with DNAss, RNAss, TMB, MSI, HRD, and 
NEO in various cancer types, which originate from epithelial tissues. Importantly, the function 
enrichment results showed SOWAHA is significantly related with many pathways in cancer. These 
findings suggest that SOWAHA plays a crucial role in cancer occurrence and progression and may 
serve as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in some cancer types, including COAD. 
 
This study has some limitations, while it systematically explores the correlation between SOWAHA 
and various cancer types and identifies potential biological processes and signaling pathways 
involved in its regulation, it largely relies on bioinformatics methods. Further experimental 
validation is needed to confirm these findings. Additionally, the biological functions and molecular 
mechanisms of SOWAHA in tumors, particularly within the TIME, require further investigation.
