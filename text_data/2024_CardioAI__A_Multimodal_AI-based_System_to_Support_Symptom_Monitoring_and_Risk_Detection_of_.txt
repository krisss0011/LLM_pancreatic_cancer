Despite recent advances in cancer treatments that prolong patients’ lives, treatment-induced cardiotoxicity remains one severe side
effect. The clinical decision-making of cardiotoxicity is challenging, as non-clinical symptoms can be missed until life-threatening
events occur at a later stage, and clinicians already have high workload centered on the treatment, not the side effect. Our project
starts with a participatory design study with 11 clinicians to understand their practices and needs; then we build a multimodal AI
system, CardioAI, that integrates wearables and LLM-powered voice assistants to monitor multimodal non-clinical symptoms. Also,
the system includes an explainable risk prediction module that can generate cardiotoxicity risk scores and summaries as explanations
to support clinicians’ decision-making. We conducted a heuristic evaluation with four clinical experts and found that they all believe
CardioAI integrates well into their workflow, reduces their information overload, and enables them to make more informed decisions.

Introduction
Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, have seen remarkable advancements over the past few decades, leading to
significantly improved survival rates across various types of cancer (e.g., breast cancer, sarcoma) [8, 46, 48, 79, 84, 97, 103].
For example, due to advancements in chemotherapy regimens, 5-year survival rates of breast cancer patients have
improved from 82.7% to 91% [104]. However, advanced cancer treatments still have severe adverse effects (e.g., liver and
kidney damage), with treatment-induced cardiotoxicity standing out as one of the most severe complications [32,
87, 96]. Treatment-induced cardiotoxicity refers to the various heart damage caused by cancer treatments, which can
lead to minor or severe consequences such as heart failure, arrhythmia, and other cardiovascular diseases [3, 6]. To
put this into the breast cancer treatment context, cardiotoxicity has emerged as the leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in long-term follow-up [44].
Recent studies have investigated early decision-making of treatment-induced cardiotoxicity [21, 24]. However, this is
challenging due to the following four reasons. Firstly, the symptoms of cardiotoxicity are often subtle in the early
stages, making it hard to recognize the onset. When more pronounced symptoms (e.g., edema) appear, the condition
Manuscript submitted to ACM
AI-based System to Support Symptom Monitoring and Risk Detection of Cancer Treatment-Induced Cardiotoxicity 3
may have already progressed to an irreversible state [50, 60]. Secondly, symptoms may occur infrequently, and with
cancer patients typically visiting their clinicians only every few weeks [43], symptoms that occur outside of clinical
settings may go unnoticed [77]. Thirdly, when patients experience discomfort at home, the primary way clinicians
learn about this is through patient self-reporting, as there are no existing methods for automatic symptom tracking.
But patients may underreport or misreport symptoms due to forgetfulness, misunderstanding, or downplaying their
discomfort [15, 16, 73]. In addition, clinicians are often overwhelmed with the primary task of managing and optimizing
cancer treatments. This ongoing high workload and pressure leave them with limited time and capacity to process
comprehensive information that would allow early detection and decision-making regarding cardiotoxicity [24, 29]. Due
to these factors, decision-making for cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity is often delayed, which can result in missed
opportunities for early symptom detection and proactive risk prediction, which are critical for timely intervention and
improved patient outcomes [107].
To address these challenges, we aim to develop an AI-based system to support clinicians’ early decision-making
of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity. Two groups of literature are particularly inspiring: Remote Patient
Monitoring (RPM) [12, 67, 114] and AI-based Clinical Decision Support Sytems (AI-CDSS) [102]. RPM uses
technologies (e.g., wearable devices or home sensors) to continuously collect patient health data (e.g., blood pressure)
outside of clinical settings [17, 69], which could be a promising solution to cope with the aforementioned challenges
of monitoring non-clinical subtle early symptom data. Furthermore, recent HCI research has shown the potential
of using LLM-based voice assistants (LLM-VA) as verbal communication interfaces to support patients to self-report
symptoms [59, 62, 110, 115], which can be a powerful complement to traditional RPM for our user case. With all the
multimodal data continuously collected via RPM and LLM-VA, it may pose an additional cognitive demand on the
already high-workload clinician decision makers, that is where AI-CDSS may help by automatically organizing and
analyzing the raw data, and presenting only a high-level risk prediction to the clinicians [20]. The challenge is how to
design a successful AI-CDSS that is explainable and trustworthy to the clinicians and can integrate into their existing
workflow. Some existing HCI literature [2, 75, 113] exemplified the best practices such as following the human-centered
AI (HCAI) principles in design [4] and engaging stakeholder through the entire design process, which inspires our
methodology.
In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind multimodal AI-based system that combines the strengths of RPM
(continuous monitoring of multimodal symptom data through wearable devices and LLM-VA) and explainable AI-CDSS
(offer a model-based predictive risk score and explanation generation). The design process also follows the principles of
human-centered AI design [4]. In particular, our work aims to answer two research questions:
• RQ1: What challenges do clinicians face in early decision-making for cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity,
and what technological design needs do they have?
• RQ2: How will clinicians perceive and interact with our initial design of the AI-based multimodal system for
early decision-making in cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity?
From RQ1, we aim to gather insights about the specific challenges and information technologies clinicians encounter in
today’s clinical decision-making workflow, from which we aim to digest the design requirements for future technologies
to address these challenges. To answer RQ1, we conduct participatory design (PD) sessions with 11 clinicians to
solicit their needs and engage them in the co-design process with our initial design sketch 3. We then develop an
interactive prototype, CardioAI, with two functionalities: (1) symptoms monitoring: vital signs collected by wearables
and qualitative symptoms self-reported via LLM-VA; (2) risk prediction: AI-generated predictive risk scores for

cardiotoxicity and accompanying explanations such as summary and feature importance. Lastly, to answer RQ2, we
conducted a heuristic evaluation with four clinicians to collect their feedback on the usability and functionality of
our system. Data are collected from cognitive walkthroughs and think-aloud during their interaction with the system
and from post-study interviews and usability surveys. The results suggest that CardioAI is perceived to be useful in
collecting and providing additional patient health data, and can reduce clinicians’ workload for decision-making.
In summary, our contributions are as follow:
• Following the human-centered design principle and practices, we co-designed with stakeholders and developed
a multimodal AI-based system prototype that integrates continuous monitoring and AI predictive models to
support early decision-making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity.
• Through an evaluation of our prototype, we identified key design considerations for future implementations of
multimodal AI-based systems in clinical settings.

Related Work
We conduct a comprehensive review of existing challenges associated with cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity,
various technologies used for remote monitoring of cancer patients, as well as AI-based clinical decision support
systems(AI-CDSS) in this context.
2.1
Challenges in Cancer Treatment-Induced Cardiotoxicity
Despite the survival rate of cancer patients has improved significantly due to advances in cancer treatment devel-
opment, new concerns and risks emerge alongside them, such that treatment-induced cardiotoxicity is a particular
complication that has aroused more and more attention [68, 82, 82]. Treatment-induced cardiotoxicity represents
damage to the cardiovascular system, such as heart failure [45, 83], caused by cancer treatments, which poses serious
risks to patients’ well-being during and after cancer treatment [36, 50]. Cardiotoxicity induced by anthracyclines, in
particular, can lead to a two-year mortality rate of up to 60% [81, 93, 100] The development of cardiotoxicity can also
lead to interruption of cancer treatment if the vital organs of the patients cannot endure the side effects of subsequent
cancer treatment [60]. Thus, monitoring cardiotoxicity at an early stage is crucial, as patients can benefit from early
diagnosis and intervention for cardiotoxicity to reduce the risk of dangerous negative effects [15, 16, 73].
However, it is difficult for healthcare providers to reliably and effectively detect early signals of treatment-induced
cardiotoxicity for timely intervention [14, 50]. One challenge is that initial cardiac symptoms caused by cardiotoxicity
could be very mild, leading to belated self-report from patients [51, 63, 106], which could hinder early diagnosis of
cardiotoxicity by clinicians during and after cancer treatment [50]. In addition, treatment-induced cardiotoxicity can
manifest at varying times: during treatment, shortly after, or even years after cancer treatment completion [73]. This
variability in onset makes it challenging to monitor and detect, particularly when symptoms arise outside the hospital
setting [89]. Primary care physicians for cancer patients are generally burdened with the critical tasks of treating cancer
patients in the hospital [24, 29], with limited bandwidth to provide clinical support to cancer survivors after cancer
treatment has been completed [107]. It is worth noting that prior work discovers a lack of standardized guidelines for
clinicians to detect treatment-induced cardiotoxicity early with effective interventions [66, 95]; thus, novel approaches
for effective and efficient treatment-induced cardiotoxicity monitoring and diagnosis are of high demand [36].

2.2
Remote patient monitoring for Cancer Care
Remote patient monitoring (RPM) involves leveraging digital technologies to collect health data from patients outside
clinical settings and transmit this information to healthcare providers for evaluation [17, 69]. In cancer care, RPM has
greatly improved clinicians’ ability to monitor and manage patient health, providing a cost-effective solution [54, 99].
Such improvement is driven by the integration of telehealth systems [42]. Telehealth systems, including the use of
technology-driven platforms to provide different types of health-related information and services [64], have facilitated
cancer patients’ access to healthcare consultations and personalized coaching, boosting patient engagement and
adherence to treatment protocols [19, 22, 57]. Patients can self-administer their telehealth systems and data can be
recorded and transmitted to clinicians remotely using a mobile phone [27, 39]. For instance, wearable telehealth
systems [26, 86] are increasingly adopted in clinical settings to provide continuous real-time monitoring of patients’
physiological data, offering more accuracy than self-reported symptoms [5, 38, 40]. For example, fitness trackers and
smartwatches can monitor vital signs that are critical for the early detection of cardiotoxicity, such as heart rate, physical
activity levels, sleep patterns, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rates, which can offer a thorough understanding of
patients’ health status [40, 94].
While these telehealth systems have shown effectiveness in monitoring specific aspects of cancer patient health
conditions remotely, they only focus on collecting physiological data that can be captured by sensors. In contrast, nurse
practitioners make regular phone calls after cancer treatment to collect patients’ self-reported feelings, and nurses can
ask follow-up questions to correspond to patients’ feedback to better understand their well-being. Natural language
communication between nurses and patients comprises rich information regarding the patient’s physiological wellness
that cannot be captured by existing sensor-based telehealth systems [78]. Thus, increasing research attention has
been focused on the development of telehealth systems with verbal communication interfaces, such as conversational
agents, that support gathering self-reported patient health data, such as daily well-being status for cancer care [53, 57].
For instance, the Nurse AMIE project uses smart speakers to deliver mental and informational care interventions
to women with metastatic breast cancer [76]; Gregory et al. [37] designed a mobile health prototype to track the
cardiac symptoms of cancer patients using questionnaires. Researchers have also developed conversational agents
for a number of clinical inquiries of cancer patients, including clinical diagnosis, patient education, and symptom
monitoring [52, 59, 108, 111, 115].
A thorough understanding of cancer patients’ well-being outside the clinical setting is particularly crucial for the
monitoring and diagnosis of treatment-induced cardiotoxicity because of its variability in onset and high-stake nature. In
particular, physiological data collected via wearable devices can provide real-time insight into subtle changes in cardiac
function that might go unnoticed by the patient, whereas telehealth systems with verbal communication interfaces can
capture rich health information in natural language self-reflections by patients. In this work, we propose an AI-based
system to collect multimodal data with the help of wearable devices and voice assistants to address the needs for early
monitoring and identification of treatment-induced cardiotoxicity [88, 89].

Design of AI-Supported Clinical Decision Support Systems
Recent advances in AI predictive modeling shed light on a broad avenue for supporting clinicians’ clinical decision-
making with accessible and efficient AI assistance [113]. Such technical advancement, in turn, led to a growing research
interest from HCI experts and healthcare practitioners in the design of AI-CDSS [1, 18, 20, 55, 56, 109]. AI-CDSS systems
can greatly improve the efficiency of clinicians’ clinical workflow, where clinicians have to process a large amount

of complicated electronic health records (EHRs) data to make informed clinical decisions [30, 33, 91, 92]. However,
traditional AI-CDSS approaches rely on clinical results for risk prediction or serve only general-purpose communication,
while facing reliability, accuracy, or privacy concerns in AI applications in healthcare care [1, 18, 56].
Specifically, in the context of treatment-induced cardiotoxicity, AI has the potential to facilitate clinicians in making
more accurate diagnoses and, ultimately, in providing appropriate therapeutic interventions [65, 112]. For example,
Chang et al. [18] trained AI with clinical, chemotherapy, and echocardiographic parameters to predict cancer treatment-
induced cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) and heart failure, reaching higher accuracy than traditional prediction models;
Yagi et al. [109]’s model robustly stratified CTRCD risk from baseline electrocardiograms (ECG). However, current
AI-CDSS solutions for cardiotoxicity detection face several limitations. One key limitation is that these models often rely
on EHR data collected during infrequent clinical visits, resulting in incomplete and limited datasets that may miss subtle,
early indicators of cardiotoxicity [75], which hinders the development of accurate predictive models. Furthermore,
existing AI systems lack integration with the principles of HCAI, which hampers their effectiveness in real-world
healthcare settings [113]. For example, they often do not fit seamlessly into existing clinical workflows and can lead
to information overload if too much information is presented to clinicians at the same time, leading to inefficiencies
and frustration for healthcare providers. To bridge the gap, our work aims to explore how to efficiently and effectively
monitor rich multimodal patient data with RPM technologies, and leverage these data to enable AI-CDSS to support
clinicians’ decision-making for cardiotoxicity early detection.

Participatory Design
We conduct a participatory design (PD) study with clinical experts in cancer treatment and treatment-induced cardiotox-
icity for two primary purposes: 1) to better understand clinicians’ needs and challenges in the decision-making process
of cardiotoxicity for cancer patients, 2) to derive design considerations for our proposed system, which aims to facilitate
remote monitoring of multimodal patient data and early detection of cardiotoxicity with AI-CDSS support. Our system
design will be grounded in the practical needs of clinicians’ current practice and focus on seamless integration into
clinicians’ workflow without adding additional burdens, following the HCAI design principles [4], which have been
advocated and applied in prior work [2, 75, 113].

Study Participants and Procedure
We recruited eleven clinicians through convenience sampling [85] by reaching out to colleagues and professional
connections in related fields. The clinical expertise of the participants includes both oncology and cardiology, as
these are the two main roles in decision-making about cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity. Table 1 presents the
demographics of the participants with a randomly assigned number denoted as 𝑃#.
Before PD sessions, we derive an initial user interface (UI) design draft for a clinician-oriented information dashboard
based on design considerations from the prior needs finding study [107], as shown in Figure 2. The initial UI design
comprises conceptual drafts of multimodal data collection visualizations, such as vitals collected through wearables,
symptoms collected via LLM-based voice assistants, AI-generated cardiotoxicity risk scores, and free-form text sum-
maries of patient current health status. We use this design draft as a probe to understand clinicians’ feedback with
respect to how AI technologies could help them in their clinical practices.
Our PD sessions consist of the following parts: (i) we first ask participants to describe their challenges in monitoring
and detecting treatment-induced cardiotoxicity during their current clinical practice, and their perspectives on the
potential of AI technologies to address these challenges; (ii) we then introduced, if needed, a brief overview of current
technologies that have been used in RPM and AI-CDSS, such as wearables, LLM-based CA, and AI-driven prediction
models; (iii) we present our UI design draft and collect feedback on visual design, interactive functionalities, and system
specifications.
The first author conducted a semi-structured interview with each participant online via Zoom. Each interview, which
lasted 35 to 50 minutes, was recorded and transcribed into text transcriptions after the session. Two members of the
research team independently coded the transcripts using inductive coding and thematic analysis [9, 10]. The codes

and themes were reviewed and refined into a consensus codebook through iterative discussions to ensure an accurate
representation of the data by eliminating redundancy and merging overlapping codes. Both team members coded the
transcripts for a second round after agreeing on the codebook, and we present the findings below.

Findings
3.2.1
Challenges in Clinical Decision-making for Cancer Treatment-Induced Cardiotoxicity. Previous studies [14, 50, 50,
51, 63, 73, 89, 106, 107] have highlighted the unpredictable nature of treatment-induced cardiotoxicity, as symptoms
can emerge at any time during or after treatment. Clinicians often rely on patients to self-report symptoms outside of
clinical settings, however , patients may underreport or overlook symptoms due to health literacy barriers or concerns
about bothering their healthcare providers. Our participants reinforced these known challenges, while also providing
more nuanced insights based on their lived experiences.
Our participants reiterated the challenge of subtle symptoms in the early stages in detecting treatment-induced
cardiotoxicity, where such symptoms are difficult for patients to detect during routine clinical assessments or when
patients are outside of clinical settings. Both P6 and P4 further emphasized the complexity by pointing out that symptoms
may not only be subtle, but, in some cases, entirely absent even when patients are experiencing severe conditions. P4
shared a case where a patient, completely asymptomatic at home, was found to have a severe severe condition only
because he was wearing a heart monitor, which is not provided routinely to all patients:
“He had been on the heart monitor for about 3 or 4 days... I got this message he had a severe form of
arrhythmia... He was completely asymptomatic. He was sitting at home relaxing, and the monitor picked up
this thing.”(P4)
Participants highlight several reasons beyond the lack of health literacy that may prevent patients from accurately
reporting their symptoms. They noted logistical barriers that possibly hinder the effectiveness of self-reporting, even
when patients are aware of their symptoms. These barriers, such as delayed communication between patients and
healthcare providers, are particularly pronounced in resource-constrained settings, leading to discouragement and
increased cognitive load on patients, as described by P1:
“In some areas, patients may not hear back right away from their physicians or nurses if they’re having
symptoms... They may feel like they’re complaining too much or being a burden.”(P1)
Another limitation identified by the participants is the difficulty in recognizing cardiotoxicity-specific symptoms
within current self-reporting systems. Many of the existing tools for symptom monitoring are designed for general
purposes and do not focus on cardiotoxicity, which can lead to missed or underreported cardiac problems. For example,
P5 emphasized that the surveys they use are “not specific to cardiotoxicity... unless there’s anything on the exam that
suggests a cardiac problem.”
Several participants (P1, P2, P7) expressed their frustration with the absence of reliable patterns or correlations
between patient characteristics and cardiotoxicity risk, making it challenging to determine which patients require more
intensive monitoring. As P1 noted, “We don’t have a good grasp on what features correlate with the likelihood of someone
developing cardiotoxicity.” Such uncertainty often results in reactive decision-making, where clinicians have to wait for
symptoms to manifest before intervening, rather than being able to anticipate and address risks sooner. Such delays,
compounded by late symptom reporting and diagnostic processes, can lead to belated intervention. P2 highlighted this
issue by sharing a case in which delays in reporting and testing prolonged treatment decisions: “The symptoms were
reported late... everything was delayed, from the echo to the stress test to the EKG.”

3.2.2
Opportunities for a Multimodal AI-based System for Monitoring and Early Detection of Treatment-Induced Car-
diotoxicity. After we introduced the initial UI design draft of the information dashboard, participants expressed strong
interest in such a multimodal AI-powered system. They pointed out several opportunities for these technologies to
address their challenges and shared their expectations.
Continuous Monitoring of Symptoms. One of the challenges discussed by clinicians, as highlighted in Section 3.2.1, is
the lack of effective ways to monitor symptoms when patients are outside clinical settings. Participants emphasized the
potential of wearable sensors to provide continuous, real-time monitoring of patients’ vital signs, such as heart rate and
blood pressure. P4 noted the value of such monitoring: “We may be able to find more cardiac patients or cardiac adverse
events related to our medications by doing this kind of monitoring.”.
Participants reported that situational factors could arise when patients are in clinical settings, such as “white coat
hypertension”, where patients may show elevated blood pressure due to anxiety in a clinical setting. In addition,
participants pointed to the advantage of using wearables for patients who are geographically distant from the clinic or
unable to visit regularly as they provide remote access to vital health data. P1 highlighted how wearables, particularly
in non-clinical setting, could help clinicians gain a more accurate picture of a patient’s condition:
“Oftentimes, our patients, especially on the oncology office, they have white code hypertension. So they come
and see us, and their blood pressures are sky high, but it’s because they’re nervous. I don’t know what they
are like outside of the clinic ... Those things can sometimes be helpful. It’s almost like people who have cardiac
monitors. ”(P1)
In addition to the potential of wearables in capturing physiological data, participants also saw great potential in
using LLM-based CAs to track patient-reported symptoms over time, without requiring manual input from patients.
Several participants mentioned that this could ease the burden on patients, many of whom struggle to remember
or document their symptoms accurately between appointments. P2 further emphasized the convenience of voice
interaction, especially for patients who may have difficulty with traditional reporting methods, such as filling out forms,
“This is a really good idea. And that way they talk, and they don’t need to be typing or spending time.”
Furthermore, clinicians pointed out that combining wearables and LLM-based CAs could be particularly useful, as
each technology addresses different aspects of patient monitoring. These two modalities complement each other and
offer the ability to link physiological vital signs with patient-reported symptoms, as P1 commented, “being able to
correlate the time with their biometrics could be really helpful.”
AI-based Summarization and Predictive Risk Scores. Several participants noted that navigating extensive medical
records could be time-consuming and challenging, and AI-powered summarization tools can help alleviate this burden
by providing concise overviews of patient records. P4 echoed this sentiment by highlighting the growing issue of
clinician burnout, much of which is driven by the need for documentation in EHRs:
“There’s a lot of burnout in medicine, and the burnout is from all of this documentation that we do. I see a
huge role of AI in that documentation... fulfill out the EHR data automatically.”(P4)
Also, participants saw promise in AI-generated predictive tools, particularly for assessing cardiotoxicity risk. As
mentioned in Section 3.2, clinicians currently rely on a limited set of risk factors to determine which patients may
be at higher risk. Participants emphasized the lack of standardized tools for predicting cardiotoxicity and expressed
their need for such tools: “I have not come across any risk scoring for cardiotoxicity. So I think that would be helpful.”

Wu et al.
Participants also noted that AI-driven risk scores could be dynamic and adjust as patient data are updated, offering
them a continuous risk assessment. For example, P7 described how AI could assist in this ongoing process:
“I think with AI there will be tools in place to even suggest what the next order should be... AI would help you
understand what the next step could be even before you start talking to the patient.”(P7)
In addition to its potential, clinicians stressed the importance of the explainability of AI models. They expressed the
need for AI models to clearly communicate what risk scores mean and what actions should follow. Without explanations,
they may be unsure how to act on the AI’s predictions. For instance, P1 discussed the kind of explanation needed: “like
the trigger event of having this higher score is maybe consideration for cardiology referral.”
The need for explainability is also closely tied to how clinicians perceive AI in their workflows. For many participants,
they expressed the same sentiment that AI tools should serve as assistants, rather than replace, their clinical judgements.
This view reinforces the need for explainability that clinicians want to retain control over final decisions and have AI to
provide actionable insights in a way that is understandable, allowing them to comprehend how AI arrived at specific
recommendations or risk scores.
3.2.3
Design Revision Suggestions. Participants provided critical feedback that reflected their expectations and high-
lighted several areas for improvement, allowing us to refine the system and UI design to better align with clinicians’
decision-making workflow.
Monitoring Key Clinical Symptoms and Metrics. Clinicians emphasized the importance of continuously monitoring a
comprehensive set of physiological parameters and symptoms that are clinically important to cardiotoxicity. Many
clinicians mentioned heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and, where possible, additional indicators such as
blood sugar levels. They were curious about the potential of wearable devices to track these diverse metrics, particularly
in patients with complex health profiles. Clinicians also noted the importance of monitoring critical symptoms such as
chest discomfort, palpitations, shortness of breath, which are typical early indicators of cardiotoxicity.
Additionally, clinicians suggested the need for patient-specific baselines that can alert the care team only when
significant deviation occur, rather than bombarding them with excessive data. For example, a sudden increase in the
heart rate that deviates from a patient’s established pattern could trigger an alert for further investigation, as P6
suggested, “The care team really should only be alerted if there’s a significant change”
Enhanced Visualizations for Critical Data Interpretation. Clinicians expressed a clear need for a dynamic and flexible
visualization of patient data, with high-level summaries and detailed data views. This dual approach would enable
quick assessments while also allowing deeper dives into specific trends and variations when necessary. For instance, a
summary graph of daily average heart rates can offer a snapshot of a patient’s cardiovascular status, while the option
to view hourly data would provide insight into specific fluctuations and their potential causes. P5 emphasized the
importance of trends on isolated data points, stating “The trend is extremely more important than just the one time”.
This flexibility in visualizing data enables clinicians to identify patterns and correlations that might not be immediately
obvious from a single metric. For example, being able to drill down into hourly heart rate data can help clinicians
understand the context of a daily average that deviates from the baseline, facilitating more informed decision-making.
Clear Explanation of Technology to Prevent Misunderstanding. While we presented AI modules and LLM-based
voice assistants to clinicians, clinicians expressed their expectations that they should be more explainable to prevent
misunderstandings and ensure proper usage. For example, understanding the basis of AI risk scores is crucial for
Manuscript submitted to ACM
AI-based System to Support Symptom Monitoring and Risk Detection of Cancer Treatment-Induced Cardiotoxicity11
clinicians to trust and effectively use the system. They would like to know how they are calculated and what they
present.
For LLM-based voice assistant, they expressed the need to provide clear explanations about how AI responds to
different patient scenarios. As P8 pointed out, understanding when to escalate care based on AI alerts is crucial:
“Shortness of breath, discomfort, and passing out should always prompt contact with the healthcare provider...something
that is acute, that is changing, should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.”

System Prototype
Based on clinicians’ insights and feedback on design suggestions, we refined our initial user interface designs. We
proposed a multimodal AI-based system for continuous monitoring cancer patients with anti-cancer treatment in a
non-clinical setting (i.e., at home) by integrating advanced technologies across three main components: wearable and
smart speaker, the backend, and dashboard with data visualization.
The system architecture of our proposed multimodal AI-based system is shown in Figure 3. Our system integrates a
wearable device, an LLM-based voice assistant, data processing modules, and a clinician-facing dashboard. The system
is designed to seamlessly collect patient data from the wearable and smart speaker, process it through the backend, and
present key data summarization and explainable AI risk scores to clinicians.
4.1
Wearable and Smart Speaker Hardware
Our findings in Section 3.2.2 suggest opportunities to use wearables and LLM-based voice assistants to monitor
continuous patient physiological data and patient-reported symptoms.
The wearable device of our system is the Garmin Vivosmart 5 [35], selected for its capability to continuously
collect and monitor physiological signals suggested by clinicians, including heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen
saturation, and skin temperature. As clinicians have expressed the importance of minimal effort for patients to use
the device, we designed this subsystem to ensure data collection remains unobtrusive. Physiological data are collected
every 10 seconds and periodically transmitted to the study app on the patient’s smartphone. The study app installed on
the patient’s device runs passively in the background, coordinates the data sync with the Garmin wearable without any
user interaction, and securely uploads the collected data to the system’s backend. The inclusion of the smart speaker
in our system, supported by LLM, allows patients to self-report symptoms through natural spoken interactions. We
chose Amazon Echo Dot1 as our smart speaker device as it is affordable and easy to use. It comes equipped with built-in
Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech functionality, and Alexa Skills Kit integration2 ensures a smooth connection to the
backend.
4.2
Backend
The backend architecture stores, processes, and analyzes the data collected by the wearable and smart speaker with the
following modules.
Conversation Module. The Conversation Module processes patient input from the smart speaker and enables dynamic,
personalized interactions through natural language processing. The core of this module is powered by a Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG) [34, 58] LLM, based on OpenAI’s GPT-4 model [71, 72], which is hosted on Microsoft

Wu et al.
Azure’s HIPAA-compliant infrastructure [72]. We chose the RAG approach for its ability to enhance LLM’s generative
capabilities by retrieving domain-specific knowledge from external resources, such as research articles on cancer
treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and established clinical guidelines [61]. Furthermore, the backend is designed to
retrieve and reference prior conversations with the patient. For instance, if a patient previously reported palpitations, the
system can refer to that symptom in future conversations, asking whether the palpitations have changed in frequency
or severity since the last report.
Risk Prediction Module. We leverage Transformer [98] as the backbone to predict cardiotoxicity after assignment to
treatment. Static patient information (e.g., demographics), and temporal data (e.g., prior medical events), are passed into
the Transformer model to calculate the probability of cardiotoxicity risk. All learnable parameters, including the scale
and shape parameters of the Weibull distribution [7], the hazard weights, and Transformer parameters, are optimized
through a mini-batch stochastic gradient descent process [28]. To enhance model interpretability, we adopt the Shapley
value method [105], providing clinicians with clear insights into the key factors driving high or low cardiotoxicity
risk predictions. Additionally, we incorporate an LLM-based explanation generation module to provide plain-language
explanations of risk scores and Shapley values, making the results more accessible to clinicians.
Information Database. We employ a cloud-based database to store collected data from the wearable and smart speaker,
conversational logs, and historical EHRs. These data will facilitate the functionality of the other modules in the system.
The database is encrypted to protect each individual’s privacy.
Summarization Module. The Summarization Module generates comprehensive daily summaries by retrieving and
synthesizing data from Information Database: patient EHRs, previous conversation logs, physiological data. This module,
powered by GPT-4 [71], ensures that healthcare providers receive a clear, concise, and holistic view of the patient’s
health status each day. By pulling data from the Information Database, the module reviews historical EHRs to provide
essential context, the most recent conversational data, data from the wearables with a particular focus of detecting any
abnormalities or deviations in physiological metrics such as heart rate, respiration, or SpO2 levels. The summarization
process highlights key trends and outliers, such as abnormal physiological data or significant changes in reported
symptoms, while providing a comprehensive background drawn from the patient’s EHR.
4.3
Frontend: Information Dashboard UI
We provided an interactive dashboard for clinicians which consolidates and visualizes patient data from the other
modules in the system. Based on clinicians’ suggested design considerations from participatory design sessions in
Section 3.2.3, we revised our initial user interface design accordingly. This dashboard interface has five main components
as shown in Figure 1.
Sec. A: Patient Information Overview integrates seamlessly with existing EHR systems, providing immediate
access to critical patient information without the need to switch between different platforms, such as demographics,
cancer type, stage, and treatment history.
Sec. B: Daily Summary aggregate and summarize key information from collected self-reported symptoms and
wearable sensor data in a concise format to support a quick overview of patient’s current status, particularly focusing
on any significant changes or issues that might require immediate intervention.
Sec. C: Wearable Sensor Data displays the collected physiological data, such as heart rate, respiration, oxygen
saturation, and skin temperature. The visualization is presented in an interactive format, allowing providers to explore

Sec. D: AI Risk Prediction presents the predicted cardiotoxicity risk score and its trends. We also present its

Sec. E: Conversational Log shows the raw conversation log between patients and the smart speaker. The visualiza-
tion leverages a clear color scheme to differentiate "normal" (green) and "abnormal" (yellow) symptoms reporting and a
selection feature to enable clinicians to select specific dates to review the detailed conversation logs.

Evaluation
To evaluate our revised user interface described in Section 4.3, we designed an online Figma [31] prototype that
participants could interact directly to mimic real-world clinical use. We conducted user studies with four clinicians
to further understand how they use the information in different stages of clinical decision-making and their future
expectations.
5.1
Methods: Participants and Procedure
At the beginning of the study, participants received an online link to a Figma prototype. The prototype displayed
realistic and synthetic patient data that we had generated specifically for the study. Participants were asked to share
their screens and navigate through various tabs and dashboard interface features. During this process, they were
encouraged to think aloud, explaining each step they took to interpret patient data and how the information was related
to their current diagnostic workflow. They also shared their thoughts on the interface design.
Following the think-aloud session, we conducted a semi-structured interview with each participant. These interviews
explored how they envisioned using the data for decision-making, their impressions of the usefulness and usability

Wu et al.
in a clinical setting, and their expectations or concerns about integrating the system into their workflow. The study
concluded with a brief evaluation questionnaire, including the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) [41] and the System
Usability Scale (SUS) [11], to assess perceived workload and system usability. The TLX [41]questionnaire used a 7-point
Likert scale to assess different elements of the task load. For questions related to demand, effort, or frustration, lower
scores reflected a lighter workload, which was preferred for the system. For performance questions, higher scores
indicated better results. The SUS [11], a widely recognized usability scale, asked users to rate their agreement with
10 statements, ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree", on topics like ease of use of the system, the need
for technical support, and learning difficulty. Two researchers processed the interview transcriptions with thematic
analysis, as in the previous participatory design sessions. We summarize our findings below.
5.2
Findings
5.2.1
Clinicians’ Uses of Information for Decision-making. During think-aloud sessions, clinicians described how they
would use the information in their decision-making, and we identified how the system could support them in the
three stages of the current decision-making workflow as described in our previous study [107]: symptom identification,
diagnostic testing and collaboration with other specialties, and clinical decision-making and intervention.
Symptom Identification. In the first stage of the diagnosis of cardiotoxicity, clinicians often begin by identifying
symptoms based on patient self-reports, either outside the clinic or during in-person visits. Clinicians praised the
system’s streamlined access to symptom reports via the voice assistant module. They typically examined the conversation
log for detailed information about when and how symptoms were reported. Clinicians highlighted the importance of
correlating these reported symptoms with the patient’s physiological data, and they appreciated the system’s ability to
seamlessly align symptoms with physiological data for deeper insight. For example, when patient-reported symptoms
such as chest pain or shortness of breath were present, clinicians would immediately check the wearable module for
specific physiological metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels. As P7 described his thinking
process: “What was the symptom? So chest pain, shortness of breath... the question is what was the heart rate, what was the
blood pressure? What was the blood sugar?”
Also, clinicians appreciated the system’s ability to provide quick and easy access to crucial metrics, such as blood
pressure and heart rate, which they consistently check during patient assessments. P3 emphasized the importance of
these vital signs in their routine evaluations, stating: “Blood pressure and heart rate are the key things walking into the
room, like any and every time.”
Diagnostic Testing and Collaboration with Other Specialties. After identifying potential symptoms of cardiotoxicity,
clinicians typically move to the diagnostic stage, where they review recent test results or order new tests to confirm or
rule out cardiotoxicity. Clinicians praised our system for streamlining the retrieval of diagnostic data, allowing them to
easily access past and current test results in one place and interpret diagnostic results in conjunction with the patient’s
medical history without switching between different platforms or systems. Clinicians frequently utilized the "Results"
and "Therapy" tabs to review key diagnostic tests for heart function, such as echocardiograms, cardiac MRIs, and EKGs,
which are crucial for assessing cardiotoxicity. As P3 emphasized: “For the heart laboratory tests, the first things I look at
are the cardiac laboratory tests... like did they have an echocardiogram, a cardiac MRI, or even EKGs.” Beyond diagnostic
results, clinicians valued how the system integrates a patient’s treatment history with their diagnostic data.
Manuscript submitted to ACM
AI-based System to Support Symptom Monitoring and Risk Detection of Cancer Treatment-Induced Cardiotoxicity15
Clinical Decision-Making. Once the diagnostic evaluation is complete, clinicians need to decide whether to adjust the
patient’s treatment plan, initiate new interventions, or increase monitoring to mitigate cardiotoxicity risk. Clinicians
emphasized the value of our system’s real-time cardiotoxicity risk scores to guide these critical decisions. The dynamic
nature of the risk scores provided a clear picture of the risk of cardiotoxicity of a patient over time.
Clinicians appreciate that the system allows them to assess cardiotoxicity risk before proceeding with treatment. P10
highlighted how this feature supports informed decision-making, particularly when choosing between treatments with
varying levels of risk:
“If you could at baseline, incorporate all the information that you have on the patient and say, ‘Hey, this
patient’s actually super high risk for cardiotoxicity from treatment option A, but treatment option B is less
risky,’ then that could actually inform your treatment.”(P10)
By offering this comparison, clinicians could balance the potential risks of cardiotoxicity against the efficacy of cancer
treatments, enabling more tailored and safer treatment plans.
In addition to the initial risk assessment, clinicians valued the ability to track changes in the cardiotoxicity risk score
over time. This feature enabled them to detect increasing risks and intervene before serious cardiac events occurred.
This capacity for ongoing risk monitoring allowed clinicians to dynamically adjust treatment plans, ensuring that
patients were protected from severe cardiotoxicity while still receiving effective cancer care.
Moreover, clinicians appreciated how easily accessible and interpretable the risk scores were, which contributed to
making fast, informed decisions without being overwhelmed by excessive data. P11 expressed their satisfaction with the
system’s straightforward design, “This risk score is nice. I would look at that quickly... It doesn’t look cumbersome.” This
simplicity allowed clinicians to integrate the risk score into their workflow seamlessly, supporting their decision-making
process efficiently and effectively.
5.2.2
Usability of Our System. During the study, clinicians were able to interpret the presented information and
incorporate them into their existing workflow. As they interacted with the system, clinicians highlighted several key
aspects of the system’s usability and its potential to support their clinical decision-making. The average SUS score is
72.33 ± 1.89 (out of 100), suggesting it offers a solid level of usability.
Simplicity and Ease of Use. A major theme highlighted by participants was the system’s simplicity and ease of use,
which they considered essential for smooth integration into their clincial workflow. All participants rated the system
very highly for ease of use in SUS, indicating that they found the system very easy to navigate, such as P3’s comment:
“like this interface so far, is relatively simple... It doesn’t look cumbersome.” Similarly, P2 echoed these sentiments, noting
that the intuitive design was an asset: “The design is good and simple. I think that’s a great way to start. ” This simplicity
in design was further supported by the NASA-TLX effort score, which averaged 1.13 ± 0.70 (out of 7.0), indicating the
system required minimal effort to operate and could be adopted easily.
Participants also expressed high confidence in their ability to use the system effectively, supported by the SUS
confidence metric, and many stated that they felt comfortable completing tasks without need for additional help. They
agreed that most people would be able to learn to use the system very quickly, a sentiment captured by the high
SUS score for this question, highlighting its low learning curve and easy fit within their existing workflows.
Improved Access to Information and More Relevant Information. Participants emphasized that the system’s ease
of access to relevant information was a significant advantage. By presenting the data in a streamlined manner,
the system minimized the need to manually search through multiple records, improving workflow efficiency. As P4

Wu et al.
explained, “If you have more information, this will make it easier without us having to look back in the chart.” The
NASA-TLX results further highlighted that the system did not impose a high workload on users as mental demand
(1.13 ± 0.23) and physical demand (0.73 ± 0.42) are low. This suggests that the system effectively supported the retrieval
and organization of information without imposing an additional burden on users’ mental or physical resources.
Participants also appreciated the system’s ability to deliver highly specific and organized information, particularly
in the context of cardiotoxicity-related decision-making. This targeted presentation of data was seen as essential for
supporting them to make informed decisions. P4 pointed out that the system effectively prioritized cardiotoxicity-related
information with a more focused view:
“In the chart, there’s so much more data. This is more specific, organized, mostly for cardiotoxicity. So the app
provides that more specific concerns information.”(P4)
Supporting Proactive and Informed Clinical Decision-Making. The system’s capacity to facilitate proactive decision
making was a significant benefit highlighted by the participants. By providing real-time updates and predictive insights,
the system allowed clinicians to anticipate potential complications and intervene early, shifting from a reactive to a
more proactive approach. P5 remarked,
“I think workflow wise, this would actually just preempt us ... so at least this way, we have a little bit more
data to say like, hey, you should go.. or hey, just follow up with your cardiologist... I think that part would be
really helpful in terms of how we actually manage patients and what we refer them.”(P5)
In addition to enhancing proactive care, the system was praised for its role in complementing existing clinical
tools rather than replacing them. Clinicians felt that the system could augment their capabilities to monitor patients.
Clinicians also recognized the AI-based system’s potential for supporting long-term monitoring and follow-up
care, particularly for patients in the survivorship phase of cancer treatment. The system’s ability to continuously
monitor patient health for extended periods was seen as a valuable tool to detect later-emerging cardiotoxic effects and
ensure ongoing patient safety. P10 suggested,
“Maybe in your survivorship, you know your patients who are 5, 10 years out from their doxorubicin or their
chest radiation... having a 30-day monitoring period before their surveillance visit would help make sure
there’s no worrying signs there that would prompt more cardiac.”(P10)
5.2.3
Future Expectations. During think-aloud sessions, clinicians also provided their future expectations for the
system, highlighting where they envision the prototype could be further improved.
Enhancing Data Relevance and System Integration. While clinicians highlighted the system’s improved access to
relevant information as a significant advantage, they also expressed the need for more clinically relevant data to
further support decision-making. One key request was for comprehensive tracking of all patient medications, including
non-cancer treatments that could interact with cancer therapies or exacerbate cardiotoxicity. P7 pointed out, “This
is only the cancer treatment. Normally, it’s not just 3 or 4 medications... there are other medications,” highlighting the
complexity of managing patients undergoing cancer treatment and the necessity for the system to provide a holistic
view of all medications and potential interactions. By incorporating a more thorough medication history, the system
could better support clinicians in recognizing potential drug interactions and side effects that could impact patient
health outcomes.

AI-based System to Support Symptom Monitoring and Risk Detection of Cancer Treatment-Induced Cardiotoxicity17
Clinicians also expressed the need for more detailed information about patients’ anti-cancer treatments, such as the
type of chemotherapy administered, its last administration date, cumulative dose, and associated cardiotoxic risks. They
emphasized that not all anti-cancer treatments have the same cardiotoxic potential, and understanding these specifics is
essential for effective management. P7 remarked, “I would want to know what exactly is the chemotherapy that we’re
talking about, because not all chemotherapies have cardiotoxicity,” pointing to the necessity of providing granular details
to assess risks accurately and make informed treatment decisions.
Furthermore, while clinicians praised the system’s ability to streamline access to relevant cardiotoxicity-related
information, reducing the need to search through multiple records, they also expressed the expectation for it to integrate
more seamlessly with the tools they already use. Reflecting on past experiences, they described the challenge of
navigating between various systems and managing the multiple risk scores and alerts already in EHRs. As P1 noted,
“We do have, in our electronic medical record, a lot of these risk scores that are already kind of popping up
and showing up for us. There’s a risk score for opiate abuse, a risk score for hospital readmission, a couple of
different things. So we want these tools, but there’s also some alarm fatigue. Sometimes we see so much when
we log in that we just kind of ignore it and get to what we need to do in the chart.”(P1)
Customization Based on Clinicians’ Specialties. Another prominent theme from the feedback was the collaborative
nature of cardiotoxicity decision-making, emphasizing the need for the system to offer customization based on the
user’s specialty. Decision-making in cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity typically involves multiple specialists,
such as cardiologists and oncologists, who each prioritize different aspects of patient data. For instance, cardiologists
are primarily concerned with cardiac metrics, while oncologists need detailed information about anti-cancer treatments.
P7, a cardiologist, highlighted this divergence in priorities, explained, “For a cancer doctor, the mammogram is useful,
important. But for me, it probably doesn’t give any additional information,” pointing out the varying relevance of certain
data types depending on the specialist’s focus. In contrast, P5, a medical oncologist, stressed the need for a quick,
high-level overview of cumulative anthracycline dosage, reflecting their focus on cancer treatment-related metrics.
Moreover, the collaborative nature of decision-making often necessitates input from both cardiologists and oncologists,
making it crucial for the system to facilitate information sharing between specialties. P11 highlighted this collaborative
dynamic, emphasizing the importance of reviewing notes from other specialists to gain a comprehensive understanding
of the patient’s treatment and condition:
“I do look at the recent progress notes. I mean, sometimes the patient forgot what happened. So it’s also good
for me to go and look at those notes before walking in. So I know what other providers have seen. And then
I can also estimate what issues I should address even if the patient doesn’t bring it up, because the cancer
team may have issues that they want some level of input on. I spent a lot of time looking these notes to try to
understand what’s going on. So we can make decisions about whether it’s the cancer drugs or not.”(P11)
By catering to the specific needs of different specialists while enabling collaboration, the system can make it easier for
clinicians to access the information most relevant to their respective roles and share critical insights across specialties.
5.2.4
Concerns.
Ethical Concerns. While remote monitoring systems have the potential to improve patient care through real-time
data collection, clinicians expressed ethical concerns around their practical implementation, especially around timely
interventions, ambiguity in responsibility, and the lack of patient education.
Manuscript submitted to ACM
18
Wu et al.
One significant concern is the gap between real-time data availability and timely interventions. Although the system
could alert clinicians to a patient’s acute medical condition, there remains uncertainty about how quickly these alerts
can be acted upon, especially outside regular office hours. Clinicians expressed worry about how the system would
function when they are not readily available to respond. As P5 explained,
“I’ll be honest that it’s gonna be hard to have, or to even remember to look at this dashboard sometimes, right?
Or even if you check it 8 am every morning, you’re gonna miss, you’re inevitably gonna miss something later
or you’ll catch it later after the fact.”(P5)
A further concern related to timely intervention is the ambiguity of responsibility when critical alerts are generated.
Clinicians expressed that, even when alerts are issued promptly, the uncertainty around who is responsible for acting
on them adds another layer of complexity. As P11 pointed out, “identifying who’s gonna take charge if there’s a red flag
that comes out is a significant challenge.” P10 expanded on this concern by posing critical questions about how these
alerts would be managed in practice, given the constraints of staffing and availability:
“Thinking about staffing, thinking about like, who’s going to be checking in with the patient? Obviously, if
the patient just starts talking, there’s no guarantee that someone’s available to listen and take that message.
Because if the healthcare system is being notified that the patient has a acute medical issue like, how does that
get to the right person to figure out, hey, do they need to call 911? Or do we need to get them to the emergency
room right now?”(P10)
This highlights the logistic challenge of ensuring that the right person is available to receive the alert and empowered
to make critical decisions based on it.
Another recurring theme in the discussions was the risk of patients placing too much trust in the system, assuming
that entering data into an app or chatbot would suffice for urgent medical issues. Clinicians were concerned that
misplaced trust can lead patients to delay seeking immediate medical attention, relying solely on the chatbot for
guidance. This points to a critical need for patient education as P11 emphasized the importance of clear communication
with patients when they need to take action:
“We have to make sure that patients know... Some patients might think, ’Oh, well, I told my chatbot that I
had chest pain, so it’s fine’... but they need to know what red flag symptoms are and that they need to seek
immediate medical attention.”(P11)
P10 further stressed that patients need to be aware of the system’s limitations during off-hours, “Patients need to know
that if they told their chatbot that they had chest pain at 9 pm on a Friday... no one’s gonna check the chatbot until Tuesday
when they get back.”
Accuracy and Validation of Information. Clinicians also raised concerns about the accuracy and validation of the
information. They were cautious about relying on data generated by technologies without rigorous validation. P7 noted:
“If it is not (validated), how should I be sure that this is all accurate information there? Because if I’m not
convinced, like I might be looking at the information, but if I’m not sure whether the information is accurate,
then we’ll go back to the patient’s chart in our own system and look for that information.”(P7)
Clinicians expressed that without confidence in the accuracy of the data, they are inclined to verify it against existing
systems, which potentially undermines their efficiency. P10 echoed this concern, emphasizing that for new technologies
to gain adoption in clinical settings, they need to undergo the same rigorous validations as existing medical tools.

Discussion
In this discussion, we explore the broader implications of our findings. We begin by discussing the potential of our
system in extending clinicians’ capabilities beyond clinical settings (Section 6.1). We then propose design considerations
for AI-assisted proactive decision-making (Section 6.2). Finally, we highlighted the technical, ethical, and privacy
challenges that arise from implementing these AI-based systems, with particular attention to infrastructure, patient
reliance, and data security concerns (Section 6.3).
6.1
Blurring the Boundary between Clinical and Non-Clinical Settings
In this paper, we shed light on the critical challenges of decision-making for cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity.
One of the overarching factors underlying these challenges is the traditional separation between clinical and non-clinical
settings, which shapes how monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment decisions are made. Historically, healthcare delivery
has been episodic and predominantly confined to structured environments such as clinics and hospitals, where clinicians
rely on standardized tools and real-time data available only during patient visits [70]. This hospital-centric care model,
however, is increasingly inadequate for conditions like cardiotoxicity, where symptoms can manifest unpredictably and
outside scheduled clinical visits.
The vision of extending healthcare beyond traditional clinical settings is not new. Over decades, various models
and frameworks have been advocated for a more integrated, continuous approach in healthcare [13, 23, 47, 49, 74].
For instance, the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) [49, 80, 90] promotes comprehensive care coordination and
management that spans various care environments. Similarly, the integration of telemedicine and RPM technologies [17,
54, 69] has enabled continuous patient monitoring in non-clinical settings, helping to address chronic and high-
risk conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes, and cancer treatments [25]. Researchers in healthcare and the HCI
community have been advancing this vision by designing technologies that allow clinicians to remotely track patient
data [26, 38, 40, 42, 94, 99] and facilitate patient communications [37, 52, 59, 76, 108, 111, 115].
Our work builds on these studies by specifically operationalizing these visions in the context of cancer treatment-
induced cardiotoxicity. While previous research has demonstrated the promise of RPM and CDSS, the unpredictable
nature of cardiotoxicity necessitates a more proactive and continuous approach. Our findings suggest that CardioAI, a
multimodal AI-based system, has the potential to extend clinicians’ capabilities beyond clinical settings by providing
continuous monitoring of symptoms and real-time risk prediction. By integrating wearable devices, LLM-based voice
assistants, and AI-driven analysis, our system facilitates seamless information collection from non-clinical settings into
clinical workflows. Our study offers a practical application that ’blurs the boundaries’ between clinical and non-clinical
settings.
While our study demonstrates the promise of multimodal AI-based systems in extending clinical capabilities, we
also underscore the importance of considering the broader implications of these systems. Continuous data streams can
be invaluable for conditions like cardiotoxicity, where early intervention is critical, but they may pose challenges in
other contexts, such as causing patient anxiety or information overload in less dynamic or chronic conditions. These
technologies should not be applied uniformly; instead, we argue that their use needs to be tailored to specific healthcare
contexts. Rather than attempting to erase the boundary between clinical and non-clinical settings, we advocate for
thoughtfully extending clinical capabilities to better address the needs of clinicians and patients, particularly for
conditions that benefit from early detection and intervention. This perspective acknowledges the strengths of traditional
clinical settings while recognizing the need for flexibility in delivering care across diverse environments.

6.2
Design Considerations for AI-Assisted Proactive Decision-Making
From our findings, one of the most significant potentials of our multimodal AI-based system is facilitating the transition
from reactive to proactive decision-making in cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity for clinicians. In current work-
flows, clinicians primarily respond to symptoms only after they have manifested or been reported by patients. This
reactive approach can delay the detection of cardiotoxicity and increase the risk of more severe outcomes. Clinicians
expressed that our system, which allows for continuous monitoring of physiological data and symptoms, paired with
predictive risk scores, provides them with actionable insights in real-time. They highlighted the potential of our system
to enhance their ability to intervene earlier, enabling them to make informed and proactive decisions before critical con-
ditions arise. This shift aligns with broader trends in healthcare towards preventive care in cardiotoxicity management,
as previously discussed by [25, 101], and our system effectively translates it into actionable clinical practice.
We also identify crucial design considerations that come with the integration of AI-assisted proactive decision-
making through continuous monitoring. A central design consideration is its seamless integration into existing clinical
workflows. Given that clinicians are already working in high-pressure environments with well-established routines, the
introduction of these systems needs to be carefully aligned with current practices. Our system minimizes disruption by
automating routine tasks, streamlining data collection, and delivering real-time insights directly within the clinical
context. Another critical factor is the risk of information overload, a common challenge with continuous data streams.
Our system mitigates this by filtering and prioritizing the most relevant data, ensuring that clinicians only receive
actionable information.
This shift toward continuous monitoring and real-time decision support also necessitates rethinking traditional
clinical workflows and responsibilities. Clinicians raised concerns about accountability in a continuously monitored
environment, particularly regarding who would monitor the data and intervene when abnormalities are detected,
particularly during non-working hours. These concerns introduce questions about the liability and workload of 24/7
monitoring, which requires a fundamental shift from the traditional episodic care model. The need for constant vigilance
and potential interventions may challenge current healthcare delivery structures, and addressing these issues will be
crucial to the successful implementation of AI-based systems in clinical practice.
6.3
Technical, Ethical and Privacy Concerns
Our study reveals several ethical and practical concerns that arise when integrating AI-based continuous monitoring
systems into clinical practice. A critical concern is the need for robust infrastructure support, including reliable internet
connections, functioning devices, and interoperability between systems. Clinicians noted that technical failures, such as
malfunctioning devices or poor Wi-Fi connectivity, could disrupt real-time symptom monitoring, delay interventions
and undermine the effectiveness of the system. Ensuring reliable IT infrastructure and technical support will be critical
for the success of these systems. In addition to infrastructure, human resources are essential for ongoing monitoring
and maintenance. While AI can automate data collection and analysis, human oversight remains crucial for interpreting
alerts and responding to abnormal data. Clinicians expressed concerns about the increased workload that this can
place on healthcare teams, particularly in 24/7 monitoring environments. Managing these demands will require careful
planning to avoid overburdening staff and ensure continuous, high-quality care.
Beyond technical challenges, there are ethical concerns. One key issue is the overreliance of patients on AI-based
systems that can delay critical medical attention. Clinicians expressed concern that patients might assume logging
symptoms into a system guarantees immediate intervention, even when healthcare teams are unavailable, without fully
Manuscript submitted to ACM
AI-based System to Support Symptom Monitoring and Risk Detection of Cancer Treatment-Induced Cardiotoxicity21
understanding the limitations of technology. This risk is further amplified in underserved communities where access to
clinicians is already limited, potentially leading to a false sense of security.
In this context, the role of patient education becomes paramount. Our findings suggest that empowering patients
through technology must be accompanied by clear communication about the system’s capabilities and limitations.
While AI-based systems can provide valuable insight and suggestions, patients need to be aware of which symptoms
warrant immediate medical attention and which can be monitored through the system. Without this education, there is
a risk that patients misunderstand the urgency of their symptoms and rely on the system inappropriately, leading to
delayed interventions. This underscores the importance of designing AI-based systems that not only provide accurate
information but also guide patients in making informed decisions about when to escalate their concerns to human
clinicians.
Privacy and security concerns are also central to the implementation of AI and LLM-based systems. As these
technologies handle sensitive patient data, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of this information becomes crucial.
Our study revealed that clinicians are particularly concerned about how patient data is stored, transmitted, and accessed
within AI-based systems. The increasing reliance on AI raises questions about data breaches and unauthorized access,
which could undermine patient trust and pose significant legal risks. Addressing these concerns will require robust data
governance frameworks that prioritize patient privacy while allowing for the effective use of AI in healthcare.

Future Directions & Limitations
Our work has several limitations. First, while we gathered valuable insights during the prototype design phase with
input from eleven experts, our evaluation study included only four participants. Future studies should involve a more
diverse group of participants and conduct broader evaluations. Second, our system was developed as a prototype and
used as a design probe to collect feedback from clinicians during the evaluation. This approach may affect the validity
and generalizability of our findings, as the results might differ if the system were deployed in real-world clinical settings.
Our findings suggest several avenues for future research and system refinement. First, further research should focus
on enhancing the usability and integration of AI-based systems within clinical workflows, ensuring that the interface,
data presentation, and interaction design align with clinicians’ needs. This includes developing seamless integration
with EHR systems to reduce friction in day-to-day clinical use. Second, fostering trust in AI tools is crucial, and future
research should explore improving the transparency and interpretability of AI-generated outputs. This can be achieved
through the implementation of explainable AI (XAI) technologies and by providing clinicians with clear, understandable
explanations of risk predictions and decisions made by the system. Third, while this study focused on cardiotoxicity,
there is a broader need to investigate how similar AI-based systems can be applied to other clinical areas where early
detection and intervention are critical. By exploring the deployment of proactive AI tools in various healthcare contexts,
future work can help improve patient outcomes and optimize decision-making processes across different conditions.

Conclusion
In this study, we explore the challenges that clinicians face in managing cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and
developed a multimodal AI-based system, CardioAI, to support symptom monitoring and risk prediction. Through
participatory design sessions with 11 clinicians, we uncovered the complexity of managing cardiotoxicity and identified
gaps in existing monitoring approaches. Our system provides continuous monitoring of symptoms via wearable
devices and LLM-based VA, and explainable AI-based predictive risk scores, which offer actionable insights to support
clinical decision-making. Evaluation by clinical experts highlighted the system’s ability to reduce information overload,

streamline workflows, and support proactive decision-making. These findings contribute to the growing field of HCI
in healthcare, providing a foundation for future development of technologies to address similar challenges in clinical
decision-making tasks. We envision that our work can inspire future designs of multimodal AI-based systems.
