ABSTRACT:  
The TraX Engine is an advanced data processing tool developed by ADVACAM in collaboration 
with the European Space Agency (ESA), specifically designed for analyzing data from Timepix 
detectors. This software supports the processing of data from Timepix1, Timepix2, and Timepix3 
detectors, which are equipped with various sensor materials (Si, CdTe, GaAs, SiC) and operate 
in multiple modes (frame-based and data-driven). TraX Engine is capable of processing large 
datasets across various scientific and medical applications, including space radiation monitoring, 
particle therapy, and imaging. In space applications, the TraX Engine has been used to process 
data from satellites like OneWeb JoeySat deployed in LEO orbit, where it continuously monitors 
space radiation environments measuring flux, dose, and dose rate in real time. In medical 
applications, particularly in particle therapy, the TraX Engine is used to process data to 
characterize radiation fields in terms of particle flux, Linear Energy Transfer (LET), and spatial 
distribution of the radiation dose. The TraX Engine can identify and classify scattered particles, 
such as secondary protons and electrons, and estimate their contribution to out-of-field doses, a 
crucial factor in improving treatment planning and reducing the risk of secondary cancers. In 
imaging applications, the TraX Engine is integrated into Compton cameras, where it supports 
photon source localization through directional reconstruction of photons. The system‚Äôs ability to 
identify the source of gamma radiation with high precision makes it suitable for medical imaging 
tasks, such as tracking I-131 used in thyroid cancer treatment or localizing radiation sources. This 
paper presents the architecture and capabilities of the newly developed software TraX Engine, 
alongside results from various applications, demonstrating its role in particle tracking, radiation 
monitoring, imaging and others. With its modular architecture, the TraX Engine offers multiple 
interfaces, including a command-line tool, an API, a web portal and a graphical user interface, 
ensuring usability across different fields and user expertise levels.

1. Introduction 
The TraX Engine is an advanced data processing tool developed by ADVACAM s.r.o. within 
the scope of the Data Processing Engine (DPE) project [1], funded by the European Space Agency 
(ESA). The TraX Engine, a further development of the DPE software [1], is designed to operate 
across multiple platforms, including a Command Line Interface (CL), Web Portal (WP), Graph-
ical User Interface (GUI), and Application Programming Interface (API) in C++ and Python. Its 
primary function is to facilitate both pre-processing and post-processing of data collected by hy-
brid semiconductor pixel detectors from the Timepix chip family, comprising Timepix1 (TPX) 
[16], Timepix2 (TPX2) [2], and Timepix3 (TPX3) [3]. The detectors are equipped with various 
sensor materials, including silicon (Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and 
silicon carbide (SiC), with thicknesses ranging from 65 ¬µm (SiC) to 2000 ¬µm (CdTe), enabling 
the detection of a wide spectrum of charged particles. Additionally, with neutron converters, the 
detectors can detect neutron interactions, with limited efficiency [14-15]. The TraX Engine is 
compatible with multiple data acquisition modes, including frame-based and data-driven modes, 
and supports diverse input formats. It produces a range of physics outputs, such as histograms 
(e.g., deposited energy, cluster size, linear energy transfer (LET), and cluster height), particle 
flux, dose, and dose rate. Additionally, the engine performs coincidence analysis to identify tem-
porally correlated particle interactions. Advanced post-processing functionalities include 
 
 
‚Äì 3 ‚Äì 
directional analysis, which estimates particle track azimuth and elevation angles, and radiation 
field recognition, which employs significant vector analysis and machine learning algorithms to 
classify radiation field types by comparison with reference datasets. The TraX Engine incorpo-
rates advanced artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning algorithms and heuristic decision trees 
for particle identification. These algorithms are capable of classifying detected particles into cat-
egories such as electrons, protons, ions, and photons. AI models, including neural networks (NN) 
trained using labelled datasets to perform particle classification offering higher accuracy com-
pared to traditional heuristic methods. This feature is particularly relevant in space radiation en-
vironments and medical applications, where precise particle identification is critical for radiation 
protection and therapy planning. The TraX Engine also enables Compton camera where it sup-
ports photon source localization through directional reconstruction of photons. The Timepix de-
tectors have broad applicability across various fields, including imaging with X-rays, protons [4-
7], radiation treatment and beam monitoring [8, 23], particle tracking [10-11], particle radiother-
apy [9, 12], space radiation monitoring [13], and neutron detection [14-15]. TraX Engine can be 
used for pre-processing and post-processing data across wide-range of applications where 
Timepix detectors are used. The aim of this work is to present the TraX Engine as a comprehen-
sive software for advanced data processing in a range of applications, including space radiation 
monitoring with the OneWeb JoeySat, proton therapy in medical applications, Compton Camera, 
imaging, accelerator, fundamental and educational physics. The article demonstrates its capabili-
ties in radiation detection, particle identification, and complex data analysis. 
2. Methods Incorporated in TraX Engine 
The TraX Engine provide an extensive set of pre-processing and post-processing algorithms to 
analyze data from Timepix hybrid semiconductor pixel detectors [1]. 
2.1 Pre-Processing, Detailed Event List 
The pre-processing stage of the TraX Engine includes several calibrations and corrections that 
are essential for ensuring the accuracy of the measured data. The first step is energy calibration, 
which converts the Time-over-Threshold (ToT) values recorded by the detector into deposited 
energy. The standard calibration procedure for Timepix detectors is described in [18], with 
additional details on high-energy calibration provided in [17]. The same principles are applied to 
the Timepix3 detector [18], while further calibration details for the Timepix2 detector are 
available in [19-20]. Time-walk correction addresses the variation in time-of-arrival (ToA) caused 
 
 
‚Äì 4 ‚Äì 
by differences in signal amplitude. The method implemented for time-walk correction can be 
found in [22]. Clusterization involves grouping adjacent pixels activated by the same particle 
event into clusters. These clusters are subsequently analyzed to extract key parameters, such as 
energy, time-of-arrival, spatial size, and other relevant parameters [12]. In frame-based 
measurements, clusters are primarily formed based on spatial proximity of the activated pixels, 
whereas in data-driven mode, both spatial and temporal criteria are used to form clusters [1]. 
2.2 Physics products 
The absorbed dose in a sensor (e.g., Si, CdTe, SiC, GaAs) quantifies the energy deposited by 
radiation per unit mass of the sensor material. The dose rate (DR) in the sensor material indicates 
the rate at which the radiation dose is received over time.  
The particle flux is calculated as the number of particles passing through a unit area per unit 
time. In practice, the flux calculation for a radiation detector can be influenced by the geometry 
of the detector, the efficiency of the detection system, and the specific conditions under which the 
measurements are taken. Ensuring accurate calibration and correction factors is essential for 
precise flux determination especially in neutron fields [14-15].  
The Linear Energy Transfer (LET) quantifies the energy transferred by ionizing radiation to 
the material through which it passes, per unit length of the material.  
The formula for LET can be expressed as: 
 ùêøùê∏ùëá=
ùëëùê∏
ùëëùë• , 
 where dE is the cluster deposited energy, energy loss, dx is track projected length in L3D, L3D is 
the length in 3D (L3D). It is determined by applying the Pythagoras theorem: 
 L3D=‚àö(ùêøùëíùëõùëîùë°‚Ñé 2ùê∑)2 + (ùë†ùëíùëõùë†ùëúùëü ùë°‚Ñéùëñùëêùëòùëõùëíùë†ùë†)2, [12, 24] 
where Length2D= L2D-2.5*ÔÅ≥a [24] 
The L2D is the projected length in 2D and ÔÅ≥a is the standard deviation along the planar length. The 
sensor thickness is well known from the production of the sensor and datasheet of the detector. 
For example, a detector operated at a bias voltage of +200 V fully depletes the sensor volume (Si 
thickness: 500 ¬± 10 ¬µm). 
Coincidence analysis is performed by identifying events where two or more particles are detected 
within a predefined time window. The algorithm tracks temporal correlations between detected 
particles, allowing for the identification of simultaneous or closely related events (e.g. 100 ns time 
window). This method is particularly important in multi-detector configurations or experiments 
with high-energy particle beams, where understanding correlated interactions is essential [1]. 
 
 
‚Äì 5 ‚Äì 
Directional analysis reconstructs particle trajectories by calculating azimuth and elevation angles 
based on cluster morphology and time-of-arrival data. This method utilizes spatial and temporal 
information to accurately determine the particle‚Äôs path, which is particularly important in 
applications such as proton therapy and space radiation monitoring, where the precise direction 
of the particle is a key parameter for treatment planning and environmental assessment [1]. 
The spatial mapping method generates two- and three-dimensional visualizations of key cluster 
parameters, such as energy deposition and particle flux. These spatial maps are constructed by 
analyzing the spatial distribution of clusters across the detector‚Äôs active area. The resulting maps 
provide detailed radiation field characteristics, enabling applications such as beam profiling, 
radiation field visualization, and material characterization [1]. 
 
2.3 Algorithms for particle identification 
The particle identification (PID) algorithms implemented in the TraX Engine aim to classify 
particle clusters by estimating particle type based on their energy and track morphology [1]. Fully 
connected NN have been developed for the TPX3 detectors with a 500 ¬µm Si sensor and Timepix 
detector with 300 ¬µm Si sensor, providing robust classification into distinct particle categories. 
In one configuration, the NN classifies clusters into three primary categories: protons, photons 
and electrons, and heavier ions [1]. A more advanced configuration utilizes six particle classes, 
further refining the proton category into low-energy (<30 MeV), medium-energy (30‚Äì100 MeV), 
and high-energy (>100 MeV) protons, while also distinguishing helium ions from other ions. This 
hierarchical classification enhances the precision of particle identification, making it suitable for 
complex radiation fields in both space and medical applications. More machine learning 
algorithms were developed and will be further incorporated in the TraX Engine [21]. 
3. Results from Various Applications  
3.1 Space Radiation: Spacecraft Radiation Monitoring 
For the design and operation of spacecraft, accurately measuring the complex radiation 
environment in space is essential to assess its impact on sensitive instruments and astronauts. The 
MiniPIX Space radiation monitor, equipped with a Timepix3 chip, 500 ¬µm thick Si sensor, has 
been deployed aboard OneWeb‚Äôs JoeySat satellite in low Earth orbit (LEO), 600 km, since May 
2023. This compact device (90 √ó 32 √ó 11 mm3, weighing 140 g) is energy-efficient, consuming 
less than 3 W. MiniPIX Space continuously monitors space radiation, performing measurements 
at one-minute intervals. The system is capable of detecting solar events and issuing timely 
 
 
‚Äì 6 ‚Äì 
warnings. The adaptive measurement routine implemented on the satellite's computer allows for 
distinction and analysis of individual particles, even in high-radiation environments. The data 
collected is processed using the TraX Engine software, which provides a detailed analysis of the 
radiation field, including its composition, particle directionality, and the quantification of particle 
radiation effects. As can be seen in Figure 1, radiation field on OneWeb‚Äôs JoeySat satellite can be 
decomposed into protons (Fig 1a), electrons and photons (Fig 1b) and heavier ions (Fig 1c). The 
TraX Engine software enables the extraction of various data products such as particle count rate 
(Fig. 2 top), flux and dose rate (Fig. 2 bottom), ensuring operational safety for spacecraft systems.

and broad components: electrons and photons (blue), and protons and heavier ions (orange). Similarly, the 
dose rate plot shows corresponding variations, with the dose rate increasing significantly during the peak 
of the event. The dose contributions from protons and heavier ions are more pronounced compared to 
electrons and photons.

3.2 Medical: Proton therapy 
Particle therapy is a highly precise external radiation therapy used to treat cancer by delivering 
particles directly to the tumor site. To ensure optimal treatment outcomes, accurate dosimetry and 
beam characterization are necessary. In this study, we present the results of experiments using 
Timepix3 detectors to characterize proton beams, including the measurement of particle flux, 
energy deposition, and spatial distribution of radiation fields. The experiments were conducted at 
the Proton Therapy Center Czech (PTC) using a 200 MeV clinical proton beam from a Proteus 
235 IBA accelerator. A Timepix3 MiniPIX detector was immersed inside a water phantom to 
measure the particle field. The water phantom acted as a tissue-equivalent medium, and the 
detector was positioned at a depth of 15 cm, with 15 cm lateral distances from the Bragg curve. 
The detector, equipped with a 500 ¬µm silicon sensor, was operated in data-driven mode, collecting 
both Time-of-Arrival (ToA) and Time-over-Threshold (ToT) data. The main goal of this 
experiment is to provide characterization of mixed radiation field created around the Bragg curve. 
This is achieved by the analysis of particle field composition, dose rate, flux, and LET with 
particle field decomposition performed using TraX Engine software. The particle flux and DR of 
scattered and secondary radiation can be seen in Figure 3. Although the contribution to the flux 
is mostly from the class electrons and photons, followed by protons, in the DR can be seen the 
radiation impact, where protons contribute the most to the dose out-of-field (Fig. 3b). 
 
 
Figure 3. a) Particle flux and b) dose rate as a function of live time during proton therapy with detector 
placed out-of-field. The plots show contributions from various particle types identified and classified using 
AI NN, including protons, photons and electrons, ions, and other species. Data collection started before 
beam was turned ON and ended after beam was turned OFF.

Figure 4. a) LET spectra for various particle types measured in proton therapy. The plot shows the 
distribution of LET values for protons (orange), electrons (green), heavier ions (red), and other species 
(purple). The total LET distribution (blue) reflects the combination of all particle types. b) Histogram of 
length in 3D (particle‚Äôs trajectory through the sensor) used for LET calculation. 
LET is a critical parameter for understanding the biological impact of radiation. To derive LET, 
both the deposited energy in the sensor volume and the length of the particle's path through the 
sensor (as shown in the histogram of 3D length in Fig. 4b) are used. By using AI NN, we can 
distinguish the LET spectra for different particles, including protons, electrons, photons, and other 
ions, as seen in Figure 4a. The low-LET interval is characterized by electrons, with LET values 
of up to 2 keV/¬µm, while the high-LET interval is dominated by scattered and secondary protons. 
Treatment planning systems often focus solely on the primary proton beam, overlooking the 
contribution of scattered particles to the dose outside the target area. Accurate dosimetry and LET 
verification are necessary for ensuring precise targeting and minimizing damage to surrounding 
healthy tissues.  
 
3.3 Imaging: Compton camera 
The Compton camera developed within the ThyroPIX project is a specialized imaging device 
designed for precise detection of gamma radiation to monitor thyroid cancer treatments. The 
system works by detecting scattered photons and reconstructing their origin, allowing for accurate 
imaging of internal radiation sources. Its integration with advanced pixel detectors like Timepix3 
with CdTe sensor material offers significant improvements in imaging performance compared to 
traditional methods used in medical diagnostics. TraX Engine includes a module that allows the 
detection of time coincidences in the sensor. Together with information about the deposited 
energy of particles registered in the detector, it enables the calculation of the original flight 
direction of the gamma photon, thereby determining the distribution range of the radioisotope.

Figure 5 compares Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and experimental results for I-131 detection 
using double-layer and single-layer Compton cameras, reconstructed with the TraX Engine's 
back-projection method. The phantom, shaped like a cross and filled with I-131, simulates the 
emission source. Results from the double-layer camera show better agreement between 
simulations and experimental data, with higher clarity and photon detection efficiency compared 
to the single-layer camera, which demonstrates lower resolution in both simulation and 
experiment.

3.4  Accelerator Physics: beam monitoring, position, direction 
In accelerator physics, these detectors are widely used for beam diagnostics, particle tracking, and 
for assessing beam time structure, dosimetry, temporal characterization, and monitoring [8-12, 
23]. Figure 6a shows the beam spot profile of incoming protons at a 45-degree incidence, while 
Figure 6b illustrates their angular distribution with a measured elevation angle of 45 degrees.  
 
Figure 6. a) Map of the proton beam spot profile measured by the Timepix3 detector (Si sensor, 500 ¬µm) 
in the sensor are of 256 √ó 256 pixels (  Ã¥2 cm2). b) Directional plot of the incoming particles showing the 
elevation and azimuth angles. The elevation angle was set at 45 degrees at the detector plane. Data collected 
at a proton Cyclotron at UJF-PAN, Krakow with 225 MeV proton beams for 5 minutes measurements at 
low flux. The color scales in both plots represent all particle a) counts per pixel and b) counts per 
spatial/directional bin displayed in color logarithmic scale. 
3.5 More applications 
In addition to X-ray and gamma-ray imaging, Timepix detectors are also used for charged particle 
imaging [4-7], providing the potential for sub-pixel spatial resolution. In educational and 
fundamental physics applications, the TraX Engine simplifies data processing, particularly with 
its user-friendly graphical interface. 
4. Conclusions 
The TraX Engine is a new data processing tool for Timepix detectors used in various applications. 
In space, the engine processes radiation data for monitoring spacecraft environments, as 
 
 
‚Äì 12 
‚Äì 
demonstrated by the MiniPIX Space monitor on the OneWeb JoeySat. In proton therapy, it 
enhances dosimetry and beam characterization by single particle identification of scattered 
radiation, improving accuracy and outcomes. Additionally, in imaging systems, such as the 
Compton camera, the TraX Engine has improved photon detection and source localization, 
advancing capabilities in medical diagnostics. The platform's ability to handle large datasets and 
provide outputs such as particle flux, dose rate, LET, and directional analysis proves essential for 
understanding and mitigating the effects of radiation in both space and clinical settings. 
Integration of AI NN for particle identification further enhances its ability to distinguish between 
different particle species and energy ranges. In conclusion, the TraX Engine sets a new standard 
for data processing in Timepix detectors, offering comprehensive capabilities for both experts and 
non-experts across space, medical, imaging, accelerator and fundamental physics applications.
