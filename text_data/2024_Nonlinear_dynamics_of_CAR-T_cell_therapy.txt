Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is considered a promising cancer treat-
ment. The dynamic response to this therapy can be broadly divided into a short-term phase,
ranging from weeks to months, and a long-term phase, ranging from months to years. While
the short-term response, encompassing the multiphasic kinetics of CAR-T cells, is better un-
derstood, the mechanisms underlying the outcomes of the long-term response, characterized
by sustained remission, relapse, or disease progression, remain less understood due to limited
clinical data. Here, we analyze the long-term dynamics of a previously validated mathemat-
ical model of CAR-T cell therapy. We perform a comprehensive stability and bifurcation
analysis, examining model equilibria and their dynamics over the entire parameter space.
Our results show that therapy failure results from a combination of insufficient CAR-T cell
proliferation and increased tumor immunosuppression. By combining different techniques
of nonlinear dynamics, we identify Hopf and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations, which allow to
elucidate the mechanisms behind oscillatory remissions and transitions to tumor escape. In
particular, rapid expansion of CAR-T cells leads to oscillatory tumor control, while increased
tumor immunosuppression destabilizes these oscillations, resulting in transient remissions fol-
lowed by relapse. Our study highlights different mathematical tools to study nonlinear models
and provides critical insights into the nonlinear dynamics of CAR-T therapy arising from the
complex interplay between CAR-T cells and tumor cells.

1. Introduction
Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy represents a significant advance in
cancer treatment, particularly for hematological malignancies such as acute leukemia and
lymphomas.
This approach involves extracting T cells from patients’ blood, genetically
modifying them to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and reintroducing them into
the patient’s body. Engineered to target specific antigens expressed by tumor cells, CAR-T
cells offer the potential to improve outcomes where conventional therapies have failed [1].
The dynamical response of CAR-T therapy can be conceptually divided into two dis-
tinct stages: the short-term response, lasting approximately one or a few months, and the
long-term treatment outcome spanning several months to years. The short-term response is

Figure 1: Fits of model (1) to time courses of two patients illustrating the multiphasic dynamics of CAR-T
cells and the different tumor responses: remission (patient B11) and stable disease (patient B2). CAR-T

characterized by multiphasic kinetics of CAR-T cells (Figure 1), arising from the interplay
between different phenotypes and encompassing four phases [2, 3, 4]: a distribution phase
marked by the decay of injected CAR-T cells and their migration to the tumor site; an
expansion phase with significant proliferation of CAR-T cells triggered by antigen recogni-
tion; a contraction phase where CAR-T cell levels decline due to reduced tumor load; and
a persistence phase dominated by memory CAR-T cells with slower decline attributed to
their extended lifespan. Clinical documentation of this response is typically facilitated by
regular blood sampling, often conducted during inpatient observation periods. Typically, the
persistence phase commences one or a few months after CAR-T injection.
Conversely, the long-term response unfolds over an extended timeframe and lacks detailed
time courses due to reduced blood sampling. This phase is characterized by sustained remis-
sion, molecular relapse detected through routine examinations, or disease progression marked
by the return of symptoms, the latter two indicative of therapy failure. Common reasons for
relapse include suboptimal CAR-T cytotoxic efficiency or expansion, tumor-mediated inhibi-
tion of CAR-T and immune cells, and the emergence of resistant tumor cells, notably those
lacking target antigens [5, 6].
A previous publication by one of us presented the development of a differential equa-
tion model that effectively captures the multiphasic kinetics in the short-term response and
provides mechanistic insights into how it emerges through the phenotypic differentiation of
CAR-T cells [4]. Regarding the long-term response, model simulations with patient-specific
parameter fits reproduced both treatment tumor control and escape (Figure 1), and also pre-
sented sustained oscillations in CAR-T cell-tumor kinetics, suggesting the existence of limit
cycles. However, this previous work primarily focused on elucidating the short-term dynam-
ics of CAR-T therapy, leaving the comprehensive understanding of the model’s long-term
behavior unresolved.
In this manuscript, we aim to dissect the long-term behavior of this previous CAR-T
2
cell therapy model. While the original model comprises a nonautonomous system of five
differential equations, the model behavior in the long-term is described by a reduced three-
dimensional autonomous subsystem. Therefore, disregarding the transient terms, we conduct
a comprehensive stability and bifurcation analysis of the three-dimensional permanent system
to uncover the underlying mechanisms governing the long-term therapeutic response. Our
study includes a complete examination of the model equilibria and their dynamics across the
entire parameter space. This investigation provides a profound understanding of how the
model parameters characterizing tumor and CAR-T cell attributes determine the long-term
therapy response. Specifically, we demonstrate that therapy failure does not stem from a
singular factor but rather from a confluence of inadequate CAR-T cell proliferation coupled
with elevated tumor immunosuppression. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the existence
of Hopf and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations. Such a mathematical analysis translates into the
therapeutic context and shows that oscillatory remissions occur when CAR-T cell expansion
is rapid. Moreover, by increasing tumor immunosuppression, which leads to the collapse
of a limit cycle with a homoclinic loop, these oscillations can be destabilized, leading to a
state of transient or false remission followed by tumor escape. In summary, by exploring
the consequences and ramifications of the model’s nonlinear dynamics, we provide valuable
insights into the determinants of treatment efficacy.
This manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the original model and
its reduction to the permanent system. Then we outline our mathematical results in an
intuitive, non-formal manner, illustrated with two-dimensional bifurcation diagrams, phase
portraits, and numerical simulations accompanied by biological interpretation. The findings
are presented with precise statements and rigorous proofs in Section 3. Finally, we provide
the context of previous work in this area and discuss our results in Section 4.
2. Results
2.1. Model for CAR-T cell therapy and reduction to permanent system
Our previous model for the multiphasic kinetics of CAR-T cell therapy comprises four
compartments representing CAR-T cell phenotypes, namely distributed, effector, memory,
and exhausted CAR-T cells, denoted as CD, CT, CM, and CE, respectively, along with one
compartment of antigen-expressing tumor cells, denoted as T. The model is given by the
following system of differential equations:
dCD

The model assumes that initially injected CAR-T cells exhibit the distributed phenotype,
transitioning thereafter to the effector phenotype at a rate η. Upon antigen recognition,
effector cells expand with a time-dependent rate that commences at its maximum value,
rmin + p1, decreasing to the basal expansion rate, rmin. Effector cells also transition to the
memory phenotype at a rate ϵ, and become exhausted at a rate Λ.
In the presence of
tumor cells, memory cells revert to effector at a rate θ. Distributed, effector, memory and
exhausted CAR-T cells have death rates β, ξ, µ, and δ, respectively. Tumor cells present
a logistic growth with rate r and carrying capacity b−1, and exert an immunosuppressive
effect on effector CAR-T cells, modeled by the mass-action law with a constant α. Both
distributed and effector CAR-T cells impose cytotoxic effects on tumor cells at a rate γ, with
the Holling-type-II-like functional response given in (1e), inspired by previous models by De
Boer and De Pillis [7, 8].
Figure 1 presents examples fits of model (1) obtained in [4], to time courses of two patients
showing different responses: remission (Patient B11) and stable disease (Patient B2). Such
outcomes suggest the existence of different attractors for the solutions of (1) and show that
even an initial expansion of CAR-T cells and decrease in the tumor load may be followed by
tumor regrowth or persistence. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the outcomes of CAR-T
therapy as described by system (1) depends on characterizing its attractors and bifurcation
diagrams.
This task can be achieved by analyzing the reduced autonomous system which describes
the permanent behavior of solutions of (1). Such reduction is based on the following remarks.
First, since the solution of (1a) is CD(t) = CD(0)e−(β+η)t, we have CD →0 for t →∞.
Second, the nonautonomous expansion rate in (1b) converges to rmin as t →∞. Finally,
equation (1d) is decoupled and may be disregarded. Thus, the long-term behavior of solutions
of system (1) is equivalent to solutions of the reduced system given by
dCT
dt
= rmin
T
A + T CT −(ξ + ϵ + Λ)CT + θTCM −αTCT,

dt
= ϵCT −θTCM −µCM,
(2b)
dT
dt = rT(1 −bT) −γ

a + CT + dT T.
(2c)
We refer to this three-dimensional autonomous system as the permanent system since it
portrays the asymptotic behavior of the five-dimensional nonautonomous system (1).
2.2. Summary of nonlinear dynamics
Our main results are given by Theorems 1, 3 and 5 presented in Section 3. In the following,
we present their contents in a informal way in order to provide a straightforward description
of our results with their biological implications.
To simplify the mathematical notation, we analyzed the dimensionless form of system (2)

dτ = p xz
k + z −wx + qzy −uzx,

dy
dτ = sx −qzy −mqy,

dτ = z(1 −z) −v
xz
c + x + z,
(3c)
where x = (b/d)CT, y = (b/d)CM, and z = bT represent densities of effector CAR-T,
memory CAR-T and tumor cells, respectively, and
τ = rt, p = rmin
r , u = α
rb, v = γ
r , w = ξ + ϵ + Λ
r
, m = µb
θ , k = bA, q = θ
rb, s = ϵ
r, c = ab
d .
(4)
All parameters are assumed to be positive.
We also assume that v > 1, otherwise the
maximum tumor kill rate γ would be less than the tumor growth rate r, leading to an
ineffective treatment. Since w > s, the parameter space is defined as
Λ = {σ = (p, u, v, w, m, k, q, s, c) ∈R9 | p, u, m, k, q, s, c > 0, w > s, v > 1}.
In Theorem 1, we show that system (3) has the following equilibria with the following
stability properties:
1. The trivial equilibrium E0 = (0, 0, 0), which is always a saddle point, with a two-
dimensional stable manifold given by the plane z = 0.
2. The tumor escape equilibrium ET = (0, 0, 1), which may be either a stable node or a
saddle with a two-dimensional stable manifold.
3. Two nontrivial equilibrium points, given by EC = (x2, y2, z2) and ES = (x3, y3, z3),
satisfying 0 < z2 < z3 < 1 whenever both are positive (i.e., xi, yi, zi > 0). Since z2 is
small, EC is denoted as the tumor control equilibrium point, while ES is denoted as
the separation point (see below). If EC (ES) is positive, the Jacobian matrix of (3)
evaluated at EC (ES) has at least one real negative (positive) eigenvalue.
Moreover, considering p (expansion rate of CAR-T cells) and u (tumor immunosuppressive
effect) as bifurcation parameters, in Theorem 1 we identify three regions in the parameter
space where the equilibria present different existence and stability properties. These regions
are separated by two curves, denoted as u = uTC(p) and u = uSN(p) (see Figure 2, expressions
provided in Section 3). The parameter regions are
R0 = {σ ∈Λ | p < p∗, u > uTC} ∪{σ ∈Λ | p > p∗, u > uSN},
R1 = {σ ∈Λ | u < uTC},
R2 = {σ ∈Λ | p > p∗, uTC < u < uSN}.
(5)
Within this context, the results of Theorem 1 are summarized as follows:
• If σ ∈R0, then the tumor escape equilibrium ET is a stable node and there are no
positive nontrivial equilibria.

Figure 2: a The curves u = uT C and u = uSN divide the parameter space p × u in regions R0, R1 and R2
where system (3) have different equilibria configuration. These curves were plotted using their parametric
expressions given in Section 3. For each region, a representative parameter pair (black dots) is chosen and
the corresponding phase portrait is plotted. The trajectories represent numerical solutions starting from
initial conditions marked by black dots. Parameter values are given in Table 1. b In region R0, the tumor
equilibrium ET is a stable node, while the nontrivial equilibria do not exist. Tumor escape is the only possible
long-term outcome. c In region R1, the tumor equilibrium ET is a saddle-point, while the tumor control
equilibrium EC is the only positive nontrivial equilibrium, and it may be stable, as shown here. Tumor
control is the only possible long-term outcome. d In region R2, the tumor equilibrium ET is a stable node,
the two nontrivial equilibria EC and ES are positive; in the case showed here, EC is stable and ES is a saddle
with a two-dimensional stable manifold which is separatrix between the basins of attraction of ET and EC.
The long-term outcome (tumor escape or control) depends on where the initial condition is located.

• If σ ∈R1, then the tumor escape equilibrium ET is a saddle-point, the tumor control
equilibrium EC is the only positive nontrivial equilibrium and it may be a stable or
unstable.
• If σ ∈R2 then the tumor escape equilibrium ET is a stable node, both nontrival
equilibria EC and EC are positive, ES is not stable while the tumor control equilibrium
EC may be a stable or unstable.
The division of the parameter plane p × u into regions R0, R1 and R2 is shown in Figure
2. One can interpret R0 as a region of high immunosuppression and limited CAR-T cell
expansion, where tumor escape is inevitable (ET is the only attractor); R1 as a region of
high CAR-T cell expansion and limited immunosuppression, where the tumor is likely to be
under control (EC may be the only attractor), and R2 as a region of relative balance between
CAR-T cell expansion and immunosuppression, where the outcome (tumor escape or control)
depends on the initial condition (ET and EC may be the only attractors). While the union
R0 ∪R1 ∪R2 does not cover the entire parameter space, it is dense in Λ. The remaining
parts correspond to the curves u = uTC, where the tumor escape equilibrium ET undergo a
transcritical with one of the nontrivial equilibria, and u = uSN where the nontrivial equilibria
undergo a saddle-node bifurcation (see Section 3; the intersection uTC = uSN is a fold point).
Figure 2 also shows representative phase portraits for parameter pairs (p, u) in R0, R1
and R2, in the particular cases where EC is stable in R1 and R2 and ES is a saddle in R2,
having a two-dimensional stable manifold. These stability properties hold for some parameter
values, but not always. Thus, while the existence of the nontrivial equilibria is completely
determined by the location of the parameter pair (p, u), their stability cannot be completely
determined in regions R1 and R2, as we show below. In Lemma 1 we give sufficient conditions
involving other parameters under which these properties seen in Figure 2 hold.

Table 1: The different values for p, u and (x0, y0, z0), used in Figures 2-6, are indicated here, while the other
parameters were always set to v = 289/20, w = 1/2, m = k = c = 3/20, q = s = 9/20.
In particular, the statement that the tumor control equilibrium EC may be stable or
unstable suggests that it undergoes a Hopf bifurcation. Investigating this issue we rigorously
proved in Theorem 3 that there exists a Hopf curve H characterized by the Jacobian of (3)
evaluated at EC having a pair of complex eigenvalues with zero real part. We showed that
the Hopf curve H divides the regions R1 and R2 into two subregions, denoted as Rs

Figure 3: a The curve H divides regions R1 and R2 in regions Rs
i (where EC is stable) and Ru
i (where
EC is unstable, encircled by a small limit cycle for parameters close to H). This curve was plotted using
the parametric expression given in Section 3. For each region, a representative parameter pair (black dots)
is chosen and the corresponding phase portrait is plotted. The trajectories represent numerical solutions
starting from initial conditions marked by black dots. Parameter values are given in Table 1. b In region
Rs
2, the tumor equilibrium ET is a stable node, ES is a saddle-point with a two-dimensional stable manifold,
and the tumor control equilibrium EC is a stable focus in the case showed here. c Increasing p leads to a
Hopf bifurcation when the parameter pair (p, u) crosses H from Rs
2 to Ru
2, where EC is now an unstable
focus encircled by a stable limit cycle OC (blue trajectory). Tumor control is now achieved with sustained
oscillation around a low tumor burden. d Decreasing u leads to a transcritical bifurcation between ES and
ET when u crosses u = uT C(p) from Ru
2 to Ru
1, where now ET is a saddle and EC is still an unstable focus
encircled by a stable limit cycle OC (blue trajectory).

Ru
i (i = 1, 2), where the superscripts s and u stand for stable and unstable, respectively
(see Figure 3). We prove that EC is stable for σ ∈Rs
i and that when σ crosses H from Rs
i
to Ru
i , EC undergoes a Hopf bifurcation and becomes an unstable focus. Moreover, there
exists a small limit cycle around EC, denoted by OC, for parameter values close to the curve
H, in one side Rs
i or Ru
i . In all of our numerical results, the Hopf bifurcation was always
supercriticial, meaning that OC is stable and arises in Ru
i ; these results were later confirmed
by Theorem 5 (see Section 3). Figure 3 presents representative phase portraits of each case.
Roughly speaking, we see that H defines, for each u fixed, a threshold pH for the CAR-T cell
expansion rate p, with respect the stability of EC: if p < pH then σ ∈Rs
i and EC is stable,
whereas if p > pH then σ ∈Ru
i and EC is unstable and encircled by a limit cycle, leading to
sustained oscillations of small amplitude around the tumor control equilibrium.
In Figure 3 we note that the Hopf curve H may intersect the saddle-node curve u =
uSN. At the intersection point, the Jacobian matrix of (3) evaluated at the tumor control
equilibrium point EC has a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues that collapse to a double
zero eigenvalue. This indicates the presence of a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. We have
investigated this aspect from a rigorous mathematical point of view and proved in Theorem
5 that indeed such an intersection exists and is a Bogdanov-Takens point where EC undergoes
such a bifurcation. We give a full analytical proof, which was possible by imposing simplifying
conditions on the model parameters.
Figure 4 shows the corresponding two-dimensional
bifurcation diagram.
The occurrence of a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation implies the existence of a curve L of
homoclinic loops in the parameter space (red curve in Figure 4), i.e., a curve along which there
is a homoclinic connection at the saddle-point ES. We see that L divides the region Ru
1 into
two subregions, denoted Ru,o
1
and Ru,e
1 , where the superscripts o and e stand for oscillation
and escape, respectively. In the region Ru,o
1
we have the same behavior as previously described
for Ru
1: the tumor escape equilibrium is stable, the tumor control equilibrium is an unstable
focus surrounded by a stable limit cycle OC, and ES is a saddle with a two-dimensional
stable manifold separating the basins of attraction of ET and OC. As the parameter pair
(p, u) approaches the bifurcation curve L, the limit cycle approaches the saddle point ES,
leading to a global bifurcation at (p, u) ∈L, when a homoclinic loop C is formed. When
passing to Ru,e
2 , the homoclinic loop disappears and there is no more attractor (either a cycle
or an equilibrium) corresponding to tumor control. Solutions passing or starting near the
tumor control equilibrium point EC spiral along it but then escape such region, converging
to the tumor escape equilibrium ET. This means that, although there is a tumor control
equilibrium EC in region Ru,e
2 , it cannot prevent tumor escape, but only delays it when the
solutions travel through the region of EC.
2.3. Therapeutic implications
The above results have important implications for the therapeutic response to CAR-T
cell treatment. We illustrate these consequences by discussing the time courses shown in
Figures 5 and 6, which correspond to the different trajectories shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4.
Region R0 is characterized by having the tumor escape as the only attractor, and repre-
sents a region of treatment failure due to the fact that tumor cells exert a strong immuno-
suppressive effect on CAR-T cells (u > max{uTC, uSN}). As shown in Figure 5a, a high dose

a representative parameter pair (black dots) is chosen and the corresponding phase portrait is plotted. The
trajectories represent numerical solutions starting from initial conditions marked by black dots. Parameter
values are given in Table 1. b In region Ru,o
2 , the tumor equilibrium ET is a stable node, ES is a saddle
with a two-dimensional stable manifold, and the tumor control equilibrium EC is an unstable focus encircled
by a stable limit cycle OC (blue curve). The long term results are either tumor escape or tumor control
with small amplitude oscillations. c Increasing the tumor toxicity u leads to a global bifurcation where the
limit cycle OC collapses with the saddle point ES, forming a homoclinic loop C (pink curve). Solutions that
appear to converge to the homoclinic loop escape the tumor control region and converge to the tumor escape
equilibrium point ET . Tumor escape is the only possible long-term outcome, which may be delayed when
the solutions pass through the region of the unstable tumor control equilibrium. d Increasing u leads to
the disappearance of the homoclinic loop C. Solutions passing near the tumor control equilibrium point EC
escape with fewer oscillations around it and converge to the tumor escape equilibrium point ET .

expansion ((p, u) ∈Rs
1) tumor control with an equilibrium is expected for all initial conditions. c,d For
intermediate immunosuppression and CAR-T cell expansion ((p, u) ∈Rs

with equilibrium (d) can occur, depending on which of the basins of attraction (denoted as A(E)) the initial
conditions are. Importantly, higher values of initial tumor burden seem to better stimulate the CAR-T cell
expansion as required for tumor control.

of CAR-T cells can eventually reduce the tumor burden to very low levels, but this remission
is only transient before the tumor escapes.
On the contrary, the region Rs
1 represents the ideal setting, since the tumor control equi-
librium EC is the only attractor. This region requires a limited immunosuppressive effect of
tumor cells (u < uTC), but also a controlled expansion of CAR-T cells (p < pH). In this case,
even a small initial number of CAR-T cells is able to expand and suppress tumor growth,
keeping a small but positive number of tumor cells under control, as shown in Figure 5b.
Region Rs
2 is characterized by bistability between tumor escape (ET) and control (EC).
This configuration results from the relative limitation on the immunosuppressive effect of
tumor cells and the expansion of CAR-T cells (uTC < u < uSN, p < pH). In this bistable
regime, it is important to note that the configuration of the basins of attraction may play an
important and nontrivial role in the therapeutic outcome. Indeed, it seems that not all initial
conditions consisting of small tumor loads lead to tumor control, even with higher CAR-T cell
doses, but on the contrary, high tumor loads seem to be required. These claims are illustrated
by the two solutions shown in the phase portrait in Figure 5d and their corresponding time
courses in Figure 2c,d: while the initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (0.05, 0.001, 0.01) leads to
tumor escape (Figure 2c), the same initial condition with z0 = 0.6 leads to tumor control
(Figure 2d). This complex configuration of the basins of attraction suggests that a high tumor
burden may be required to activate CAR-T cells in order to achieve sufficient expansion that
later leads to tumor control.
The occurrence of Hopf bifurcation within regions R1 and R2 also have important conse-
quences for therapeutic implications, and is intrinsically related with the expansion rate of
CAR-T cells. While tumor control consisting of exponential decay (Figure 5d) or damped os-
cillations (Figure 6a) is achieved when the CAR-T cell expansion is limited (p < pH, σ ∈Rs
i,
EC is a stable node or focus), a high expansion rate (p > pH, σ ∈Ru
i ), leads to an sustained
oscillations of the residual tumor cells (the attractor is the limit cycle OC around EC, Figure
6b). The results indicate that the high expansion rate of CAR-T cells leads to a stronger
response against tumor cells, which then decline to very low levels. However, the stimulation
of CAR-T cell expansion is then decreased, allowing tumor regrowth until the cycle repeats.
Finaly, the ocurrence of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation suggests that a increased immuno-
suppressive effect u of tumor cells may desestabilize tumor control by CAR-T cells, leading
to transient control which only delays tumor escape. Indeed, we see in Figure 6c that, at
the bifurcation curve L, the collapse of the limit cycle OC in a homoclinic loop leads to
amplifying oscillations of tumor cells until they reach a level where they are able to escape
and suppress CAR-T cells. As the immunossuppressive effect increases (region Ru,e
2 ), this is
effect becomes stronger, with less oscilations before escape (Figure 6d).
In summary, our analysis revealed the complex nonlinear dynamics of CAR-T cell therapy
as described by the permanent system (3) and translated into important insights into long-
term therapeutic outcome. In particular, we mention the nontrivial dependence on the initial
tumor load required to achieve tumor control in the bistable regime; the role of increased
CAR-T cell expansion in driving oscillating instead of damped tumor control, through a
Hopf bifurcation; and the role of the immunosuppressive effect of tumor cells in transforming
a scenario of oscillating tumor control into transient control followed by escape, through a
Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation.

3. Mathematical Analysis
In this section, we provide the formal statements, proofs and details for all results pre-
sented before.
3.1. Stability of equilibria
The following theorem summarizes the the existence and stability analysis of equilibria.
Theorem 1. Consider system (3) with the parameter vector denoted by σ = (p, u, ˆσ) ∈Λ,
ˆσ = (v, w, m, k, q, s, c) fixed and consider p and u as bifurcation parameters. There exists
p∗> 0 and continuous increasing functions (denoted as bifurcation curves)
p 7→u = uTC(p), p > 0
and
p 7→u = uSN(p), p ⩾p∗
(6)
satisfying uTC(p∗) = uSN(p∗), u′
TC(p∗) = u′
SN(p∗) and uSN(p) > uTC(p) for p ⩾p∗, and such
that the following positivity and stability conditions for the equilibria of system (3) hold:
1. The trivial equilibrium E0 = (0, 0, 0) is a saddle; its two-dimensional stable manifold is
the plane z = 0, and its one-dimensional unstable manifold is the segment 0 < z < 1
along the z-axis.
2. The tumor escape equilibrium ET = (0, 0, 1) is always positive; it is a stable node if
u > uTC, and it is a saddle with a two-dimensional stable manifold if u < uTC.
3. There are up to two positive nontrivial equilibrium points, denoted by EC = (x2, y2, z2)
and ES = (x3, y3, z3), which satisfy 0 < z2 < z3 < 1 whenever both are positive. If
u < uTC only EC is positive; if p > p∗and uTC < u < uSN, EC and ES are positive;
if p > p∗and u > uSN, or if p < p∗and u > uTC, there are no positive nontrivial
equilibria.
4. If JS and JC denote the Jacobian matrix of system (3) evaluated at ES and EC respec-
tively, then JS has at least one positive eigenvalue when ES is positive, and JC has at
least one real negative eigenvalue when EC is positive.
The proof of Theorem 1 is established below, where each paragraph concerns to one
statement. The existence of uTC(p), p∗and uSN(p) is established along the proof, and their
expressions are given in (8), (17) and (22) respectively.
Invariance of R3
+. As a remark, it is straightforward to note that the first octant R3
+ is
invariant with respect the flow of (3). Therefore all trajectories with non-negative initial
conditions remain with non-negative values.
Equilibrium points. The equilibria of system (3) are easily obtained by setting the derivatives
in (3) to zero. They are given by the trivial equilibrium E0 = (0, 0, 0), the tumor escape
equilibrium ET = (0, 0, 1), and up to two nontrivial equilibria, which are shown below.
14
Trivial equilibrium. The stability of the trivial equilibrium E0 is determined by the eigenval-
ues of the Jacobian matrix of (3) evaluated at E0, which is
J0 =


−w
0
0
s
−mq
0
0
0
1

.
The eigenvalues are −w, −mq, and 1. Therefore, E0 is a saddle, with a two-dimensional
stable manifold. This stable manifold is the invariant plane z = 0, since (0, 0) is globally
asymptotically stable for subsystem (3a-b) with z = 0 (this can be shown by solving dx/dτ =
−wx and substituting the solution in dy/dτ = sx−mqy). In a similar way, setting x = y = 0
in (3), we see that the unstable manifold of E0 in R3
+ is the segment 0 < z < 1 along the
z-axis. This proves item 1 of Theorem 1.
Tumor escape equilibrium. The stability of the tumor escape equilibrium ET is determined
by the eigenvalues of
JT =


p
1+k −u −w
q
0
s
−q −mq
0
−v
1+c

−1

.
Denoting these eigenvalues by λ(T)
i
, i = 1, 2, 3, we have λ(T)
3
= −1 < 0, while λ(T)
1
and λ(T)
2
are the eigenvalues of
ˆJT =

p
1+k −u −w
q
s
−q(1 + m)

.
The characteristic polynomial of ˆJT is ˆP(λ) = λ2 + b1λ + b0, with coefficients
b0 = q(1 + m) (u −uTC)
and
b1 = (u −uTC) + (1 + m)q +
s
m + 1,
(7)
where
uTC =
p
k + 1 +
s
m + 1 −w.
(8)
Further, the discriminant of ˆP(λ) is
b2
1 −4b0 = (u −uTC −(1 + m)q)2 + 2s ((u −uTC) + (1 + m)q)
m + 1
+
s2
(m + 1)2.
(9)
From (7), (8) and (9), we conclude the following. If u < uTC, then b0 < 0 and λ(T)
1
and λ(T)
2
are real with opposite signs; since λ(T)
3
< 0, in this case, ET is a saddle with a two-dimensional
stable manifold. If u > uTC, then b0 > 0, b1 > 0 and b2
1 −4b0 > 0; thus λ(T)
1
and λ(T)
2
are real
and negative, and ET is a stable node. This proves item 2 of Theorem 1.
Nontrivial equilibria. To find the nontrivial equilibria with x, y, z > 0, we solve dz/dτ = 0
for x, obtaining
x = xC(z) = (1 −z)(c + z)
z + v −1
.
(10)
15
Solving dy/dτ = 0 for y, we obtain
y = yC(z) =
sxC(z)
q(z + m).
(11)
Substituting y = yC(z) in dx/dτ = 0 with x ̸= 0, we obtain
ϕ(z) = 0,
where
ϕ(z) =
p
k + z +
s
m + z −w
z −u.
(12)
We conclude that the nontrivial equilibria have the form (xi, yi, zi) with
xi = xC(zi) and yi = yC(zi),
where zi is a real root of (12). A nontrivial equilibrium has biological meaning only when it
is positive, i.e., if xi, yi, zi > 0. Since v > 1, we have xi, yi, zi > 0 if and only if the root zi
satisfies
0 < zi < 1,
(13)
which we denote as feasibility conditions or feasibility interval.
Equation (12) is equivalent to the third-degree polynomial equation
Γ(z) = 0,
where Γ(z) = c3z3 + c2z2 + c1z + c0,
(14)
with coefficients
c3 = u, c2 = w + mu + ku −s −p, c1 = mku + kw + mw −ks −mp, c0 = kmw.
(15)
Note that c3 > 0 implies Γ(−∞) = −∞. Since Γ(0) = c0 > 0, the Intermediary Value
Theorem (IVT) guarantees that Γ has a real negative root z1 < 0. Thus, Γ(z) admits at
most two positive roots, which we denote by z2 and z3.
When both roots are positive,
we denote then in the order z2 < z3. Therefore, there are up to two nontrivial equilibria,
EC = (x2, y2, z2) and ES = (x3, y3, z3).
We analyze the existence of these roots assuming u as bifurcation parameter. Note that
Γ(1) = (k + 1)(m + 1) (u −uTC) .
(16)
Therefore, if 0 < u < uTC, then Γ(0) > 0 > Γ(1) and Γ(1) < 0 < Γ(∞) = ∞. Thus, by
the IVT, Γ(z) has a root z2 ∈(0, 1) and another root z3 > 1. By (13), we conclude that if
u ∈(0, uTC) there is a unique positive nontrivial equilibrium, which is EC.
Note that ∂Γ/∂u = kmz + (k + m)z2 + z3 > 0 for z > 0. Therefore, as u increases, the
values of Γ(z) also increase, for all z > 0. Therefore, the roots z2 < 1 and z3 > 1 move to
right and left respectively. When u reaches uTC, one of these roots z˜i reaches z = 1 because
Γ(1) = 0 if u = uTC. Note that this means a transcritical bifurcation between some of the
Ei (i = C, S) and ET at u = uTC, since zi = 1 implies Ei = (0, 0, 1) = ET. Note that, since
Γ is a third-degree polynomial with three real roots z1 < 0 < z2 < z3 and leading coefficient
c3 > 0, we necessarily have Γ′(z1) > 0, Γ′(z2) < 0 and Γ′(z3) > 0. Therefore, to decide which
root z2 or z3 first crosses z = 1 as u reaches uTC, we analyze the sign of the derivative of
Γ(z) at z = 1 when the crossing occurs, i.e., the sign of ρ∗= Γ′(1) calculated with u = uTC.
16
If ρ∗< 0, we have z2 = 1 when u = uTC; if ρ∗> 0, we have z3 = 1 when u = uTC. The
formula for ρ∗is
ρ∗= (m + 1)
k + 1
(p −p∗) ,
where
p∗= (k + 1)2

w −
s
(m + 1)2

.
(17)
Note that p∗> 0, because w > s (see (4)).
First, we assume p < p∗. If u ∈(0, uTC), we have a single root z2 ∈(0, 1) and a single
positive nontrivial equilibrium EC; when u = uTC, EC collides with ET; for u > uTC the root
z2 leaves the feasibility interval (13) and there are no positive nontrivial equilibria.
Now, assuming p > p∗, we have the following. If u ∈(0, uTC), we have a root z2 ∈(0, 1)
and other root z3 ∈(1, ∞), thus there is a single positive nontrivial equilibrium EC. For
u = uTC, we have z3 = 1 and ES coincides with ET. For u slightly greater than uTC, we
have 0 < z3 < 1 and the ES is now also positive. As u increases, the two positive roots
z2 < z3 persist until colliding when u reaches a critical threshold uSN > uTC, i.e., EC and
ES collapse to a saddle-node point at uSN (see below). For u > uSN, there is no positive
nontrivial equilibria. This proves item 3 of Theorem 1.
The bifurcation curves. The threshold uSN and the collision point where z2 = z3 are the
solutions (u, z) of the system of equations



Γ(z) = 0,
Γ′(z) = 0,
0 < z < 1.
Solving this system for p and u, we obtain a parameterization z 7→(pSN(z), uSN(z)) in the
plane p × u of a curve along which Γ(z) has a double real root satisfying the feasibility
conditions. The parametrized curve is given by

,
u = uSN(z) = (m −k)s
(m + z)2 + kw
z2 ,
0 < z < 1.
(18)
We now prove some properties. First, note that pSN(z) > 0 since w > s and
1
z2 −
1
(m + z)2 > 0.
Further, from (18), uSN(z) can also be written as
uSN(z) = k pSN(z)
(k + z)2 +
ms
(m + z)2.
(19)
17
Therefore, uSN(z) > 0. Further, we have
lim
z→0+(pSN(z), uSN(z)) = (+∞, +∞),
and
lim
z→1−(pSN(z), uSN(z)) = (p∗, uTC(p∗)).
Thus, the saddle-node curve belongs to the first quadrant of the plane p × u, and connects a
point at infinity to the point in the curve u = uTC(p) with p = p∗. Note also that

< 0,
(20)
since w > s and
1
z3 −
1
(m + z)3 > 0.
Therefore, pSN(z) is a strictly decreasing function in the interval z ∈(0, 1) whose image is
(p∗, ∞). By the Inverse Function Theorem, pSN(z) admits an inverse function p 7→zSN(p),
defined for p ∈(p∗, ∞) and whose image is (0, 1), with derivative satisfying
z′
SN(p) =
1
p′
SN(z) < 0.
(21)
Substituting z = zSN(p) in (19) gives the expression of uSN as function of p only,
uSN(p) =
kp
(k + zSN(p))2 +
ms
(m + zSN(p))2.
(22)
Differentiation shows that uSN(p) is a strictly increasing function, since z′
SN(p) < 0 and

(k + zSN(p))2 > 0.
(23)
We note that uSN(p) and uTC(p) not only intersect at p = p∗but are also tangent. Indeed,
making p →p∗in (23) we have zSN(p) →1 and then using (21), we have
u′

Substituting (20) with z →1 in the above expression leads to the conclusion that
u′
SN(p∗) =
1
k + 1 = u′
TC(p∗).
Finally, we show that uSN(p) > uTC(p) for all p > p∗. Since z 7→pSN(z) in (18) is a one-
to-one map from (0, 1] to [p∗, ∞) (the extension to z = 1 follows from the limits above), we
see that writing p = pSN(z) in (8) gives a parameterization of u = uTC(p) in terms of z,
z 7→(pSN(z), uTC(pSN(z))). Since
uSN(z)−uTC(pSN(z)) = (z −1)2 (k(m + 1)m2w + z2(k(mw + w −s) + ms) + 2k(m + 1)mwz)
(k + 1)(m + 1)z2(m + z)2
,
and w > s, we have uSN(z) > uTC(pSN(z)) for all z ∈(0, 1) and thus uSN(p) > uTC(p) for
all p > p∗.
The above results prove the statements in Theorem 1 about properties of the bifurcation
curves p 7→uTC(p) and p 7→uSN(p).
18
Stability of nontrivial equilibria. We now analyze the stability of the nontrivial equilibrium
Ei, i = C, S under the assumption that they are positive, giving a proof for item 4 of Theorem
1. We denote the Jacobian matrix of system (3) at Ei as Ji, i = C, S. Using the fact that zi
satisfies (12) and yi satisfies (11), we simplify the entries j11, j13 and j23, obtaining
Ji =

vxi(c + xi)
(c + xi + zi)2.
(25)
The characteristical polynomial of Ji is given by
PE(λ) = λ3 + d2λ2 + d1λ + d0,
(26)
where
d2 =
szi
(m + zi) + q(m + zi) −j33,

(27)
We analyze the sign of d0. Comparing the expression of j13 with the derivative of ϕ(z) in
(12), we can write
j13 = xizi

s
(m + zi)2 + ϕ′(zi)

.
Substituting this and j31 in d0, we obtain
d0 = qvxiz2
i (c + zi)(m + zi)
(c + xi + zi)2
ϕ′(zi).
(28)
From the results on the existence of the nontrivial equilibria, we note that z2 and z3 are the
unique positive roots of ϕ(z) = 0. Since 0 < z2 < z3 and (see (12))
lim
z→0+ ϕ(z) = −∞and
lim
z→∞ϕ(z) = −u,
we conclude from the differentiability of ϕ that ϕ′(z2) > 0 > ϕ′(z3) (otherwise, ϕ would have
other roots). This implies that d0 > 0 for i = C (zi = z2) and d0 < 0 for i = S (zi = z3). Since
d0 = −λ1λ2λ3, where λj are the eigenvalues of Ji, we conclude that at least one eigenvalue
of JC is real negative when EC is positive and at least one eigenvalue of JS is real positive
when ES is positive. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.
19
Sufficient conditions for d2 > 0. While the above results (d0 < 0 for JS) implies that ES
is not stable because JS has at least one positive eigenvalue, it does not establish that the
remaining two eigenvalues have real negative parts, i.e., that ES is a saddle with a two-
dimensional stable manifold. Note, however, that the condition d2 > 0 implies this property,
since d2 = −(λ1 + λ2 + λ3).
On the other hand, the above results also do not guarantee that EC is stable. To prove
this, the Routh-Hurwitz conditions
d0 > 0,
d2 > 0 and d2d1 −d0 > 0,
must be checked for JC. While d0 > 0 is always satisfied, the remaining conditions require
additional hypotheses on the parameters. This implies that EC may be stable but not always,
suggesting a Hopf bifurcation when d2d1 −d0 = 0.
In light of these remarks, we now give conditions which imply d2 > 0 for JS and JC. We
will also use these conditions in Theorem 3 to show that EC undergoes a Hopf bifurcation.
To express d2 in terms of zi and the model parameters, we replace xi = xC(zi) from (10)
in j33 in (25) and then in d2 in (27), obtaining
d2 =
szi
m + zi
+ q(m + zi) + zi(zi −1)2
v(c + zi) + zi(c + 2zi −1)
(c + zi)
.
(29)
The first three terms in (29) are positive. Note that the roots zi depend only on p, k, s, m, w
and u (see (12)). Therefore, once these parameters are given and determine zi, if c > 1 −2zi
we have d2 > 0. If this is not true, then we see that there are thresholds for q and v so that
d2 > 0. These conclusions are summarized in the following Lemma.
Lemma 1. Given p, k, s, m, w, u, and z2 and z3 the two possible real and positive roots of
(12), if one of the following conditions holds, then the coefficient d2 of the characteristic
polynomials of JS and JC is positive:

In addition to the conditions of Lemma 1, if one also admits that the third Routh-Hurwitz
condition holds for JC, then we have the scenario shown in Figure 2 and given in the following
Corollary.
Corollary 1. Under the conditions of Lemma 1, ES is a saddle with a two-dimensional stable
manifold, while EC is stable if d2d1 −d0 > 0 also holds.

3.2. Hopf bifurcation
As shown above, it is not always the case that EC is stable, and our previous results
suggest that it can become unstable via a Hopf bifurcation. We now briefly recall some
aspects of Hopf bifurcation theory and present a simple criterion by Liu that gives sufficient
and necessary conditions for a simple Hopf bifurcation. We then use this approach to prove
that the tumor control equilibrium EC undergoes such a bifurcation.
A Hopf bifurcation is a local bifurcation in which an equilibrium of a dynamical system
loses stability because a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix crosses
the imaginary axis [9, 10, 11, 12]. More specifically, consider system
x′ = f(x, ζ),
(30)
where x = (x, y, z) ∈U ⊂R3, f is of class C∞on the open set U, and ζ ∈R is a bifurcation
parameter, while the other parameters are fixed. Suppose it has an equilibrium x0 = x0(ζ)
that is a function of ζ for ζ near certain ζH. Denote the Jacobian matrix of (30) by J(x, ζ).
If at ζ = ζH, J(x0, ζH) has a simple pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues ±λ (ζH) and no
other eigenvalues with zero real parts and if
d
dζ Re λ(ζ)

ζ=ζH
̸= 0, then a small-amplitude
periodic solution surrounding x0 emerges as ζ < ζH or ζ > ζH, for ζ is close to ζH. The
particular case where all other eigenvalues (one, in the third-dimensional case) of J(x0, ζH)
have negative real parts is called simple Hopf bifurcation [13, 14, 15].
Typically, the criteria for a Hopf bifurcation of codimension 1 involve calculating the
eigenvalues of the Jacobian and the normal form of the system around the equilibrium. The
computation of the Lyapunov coefficient, which determines whether the bifurcation is subcrit-
ical, supercritical, or degenerate, is even more complex, requiring the computation of second
and third order coefficients around equilibrium. This task is challenging for high-dimensional
systems, and even for low-dimensional systems where the equilibria depend on roots of higher-
degree polynomials. In such cases, theoretical analysis with symbolic computations becomes
difficult, if not impossible.
An alternative and simpler approach to guarantee the existence of a Hopf bifurcation was
proposed by Liu in 1994 [13] and has been applied in various modeling contexts [14, 15, 16,
17, 18]. This criterion is based on the degeneracy of one of the Routh-Hurwitz conditions and
relies solely on the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian. Although it
only guarantees the existence of a simple Hopf bifurcation and does not provide information
about its nature (subcritical, supercritical, or degenerate), it is very useful for identifying the
locus (manifold) in the parameter space where the equilibrium has a pair of purely imaginary
eigenvalues.
For simplicity, we state Liu’s theorem as recently presented by Shih [15], restricting
ourselves to the dimension n = 3. For a comprehensive description of this approach, refer to
[14].
Theorem 2. [15] Consider system (30) and denote the characteristic polynomial of J(x, ζ)
by
PE(x, ζ, λ) = λ3 + d2(x, ζ)λ2 + d1(x, ζ)λ + d0(x, ζ).
(31)
21
A simple Hopf bifurcation occurs at x = x0 = x0 (ζH) and ζ = ζH if and only if
d0 (x0, ζH) > 0,
d2 (x0, ζH) > 0,
d2 (x0, ζH) d1 (x0, ζH) −d0 (x0, ζH) = 0,
d
dζ [d2 (x0, ζ) d1 (x0, ζ) −d0 (x0, ζ)]

ζ=ζH
̸= 0.
(32)
We apply Theorem 2 to system (3) and the tumor control equilibrium EC. The Jacobian
matrix evaluated at x0 = EC = (x3, y3, z3), and the coefficients of the characteristic polyno-
mial PE(λ) are given in (24) and (27). We proved that d0 > 0, and, under the conditions of
Lemma 1, we have d2 > 0. According to Theorem 2, the Hopf locus, i.e., the manifold in the
parameter space where a Hopf bifurcation occurs, is given by
ψ := d2d1 −d0 = 0.
To obtain a characterization of the Hopf locus in the parameter plane p × u, we proceed
in the same way as before for the saddle-node bifurcation, obtaining a parameterization z 7→
(pH(z), uH(z)) of the curve ψ = 0, keeping the other parameters fixed. This parameterization
is the solution (p, u) of the system of equations
 Γ(p, u, z) = 0,
ψ(p, u, z) = 0.
(33)
Indeed, for each z, the solution of this system correspond a parameter pair (pH(z), uH(z))
for which z is a root of Γ(z) = 0 (equation (14)) and ψ = 0. To solve (33) for p and u in
terms of z, we note the following. First, from (27), we have
ψ = j13j31q(m+z)−j31qsxz
m + z +

j33 −q(m + z) −
sz
m + z
 
j13j31 + j33

q(m + z) +
sz
m + z

.
Checking the expressions of j13, j31 and j33 in (25), we see that none of them depend on u,
and only j13 depends on p, being a degree one polynomial in p. Therefore, ψ is also a degree
one polynomial in p. Replacing xi by (10) with z = zi, we can write
ψ = Aψ(z) + Bψ(z)p,
where
Aψ(z) = j31(1−z)(c+z)(j33w(m+z)−sz(qz+w))
z(m+z)(v+z−1)

,
Bψ(z) = j31(1−z)z(c+z)
(k+z)2(v+z−1)
  sz
m+z −j33

.
With this, the second equation of (33) is easily solvable for p, while the first is then solved
for u (see (12)). Thus, the Hopf locus is parametrized by






u = uH(z) = pH(z)
k + z +
s
m + z −w
z ,
(34)
22
which is defined for Bψ(z) ̸= 0. Since j31 < 0 and (1 −z)/(v + z −1) > 0 (see (10)), we
conclude that Bψ(z) = 0 if and only if sz/(m + z) = j33, which is equivalent to the third
degree polynomial equation
pB(z) = m
 v(c + 2z −1) + (z −1)2
+ cv(s + z) + z
 v(s + 2z −1) + (z −1)2
= 0.
(35)
Excluding the possible roots of (35), (34) is well-defined for z ∈IH = {z ∈(0, 1); pB(z) ̸= 0}.
If we fix u and adopt ζ = p as the bifurcation parameter of Theorem (2), this also guarantees
the last condition in (32), since dψ/dp = Bψ ̸= 0. To guarantee that that pH(z) and uH(z)
do not become negative, we conclude that IH needs to be restricted to
IH = {z ∈(0, 1); pB(z) ̸= 0, −Aψ(z)
Bψ(z) > (k + z)
w

since uH(z) > 0 if and only if
pH(z) > (k + z)
w


> 0.
Finally, we note that the Hopf locus is contained in the image of (34), but is not necessarily
equal to it. This is because (34) gives all parameter pairs for which ψ = d2d1 −d0 = 0, and
this condition may also include a neutral saddle. Indeed, if a polynomial c0 + c1λ + c2λ2 + λ3
has real roots l1, l2, l3 with l2 = −l1, then c2c1−c0 = 0, with c2c0 < 0. Thus, ψ = d2d1−d0 = 0
is a condition also for a neutral saddle. To differ between the two cases, we note that in a
Hopf point, the coefficients satisfy d2d0 > 0. Since d2 > 0 under the hypothesis of Lemma 1,
the interval for z which gives the Hopf locus is {z ∈IH; d0 > 0}. A boundary point for this
is z∗such that d0 = 0, which implies, from (28), in ϕ(z) = 0, corresponding to the a point
at the saddle-node curve. In summary, if the curve (34) intersects the saddle-node curve,
only one part of it corresponds to the Hopf locus for EC, while the other corresponds to
locus of neutral saddle for ES. The possibility of such intersection also suggests the existence
of a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation, as we shall see below. For the parameter values used in
Figures 3 and 4, the interval IH is (0.15, 0.172041), with the left boundary corresponding to
d0 = 0 and the right to uH = 0.
With the above results, we have proved the following.
Theorem 3. Assume the conditions of Lemma 1 hold, denote by λ1 the real negative eigen-
value of JC given by Theorem 1, and by λ2 and λ3 the other two eigenvalues of JC. Then,
there exists an open interval IH and a curve CH parameterized by
z 7→(pH(z), uH(z)) ∈CH, z ∈IH,
given in (34), such that λ2 and λ3 form a pair of complex eigenvalues with zero real part if
and only if (p, u) = (pH(z), uH(z)) for some z ∈IH. Moreover, CH divides each of regions
R1 and R2 into two subregions Rs
i and Ru
i , i = 1, 2, such that λ2 and λ3 have negative real
part in Rs
i and positive real part in Ru
i . For (p, u) close to (pH(z), uH(z)) in one of the sides
Rs
i or Ru
i , there exists a small-amplitude periodic solution OC near EC.
23
The criterion by Liu does not inform whether the Hopf bifurcation is subcritical, super-
critical or degenerate. Thus, we cannot infer the stability of the periodic solution OC and
whether it lies in Rs
i or Ru
i . In all of our simulations, we found that it is always exists in
Ru
i and is stable, implying that the bifurcation is supercritical, so that the attractor changes
from the equilibrium point EC to the limit cycle OC as (p, u) goes from Rs
i to Ru
i . We shall
see that these findings are valid under the assumptions of Theorem 4, which guarantees the
existence of a Boganov-Takens bifurcation, which in turn allows us to infer the exact type of
the Hopf bifurcation.
3.3. Bogdanov-Takens Bifurcation
The possibility that the Hopf curve H intersects the saddle-node curve u = uSN suggests
the existence of a Bogdanov-Takens point at the intersection point, where the Jacobian matrix
has a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues and a zero eigenvalue.
In order to provide an analytical proof, we first establish some simplifying relations be-
tween the model parameters, which allow us to easily calculate the quantities necessary to
prove the existence of a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. We start by noting that setting m = k
allows to obtain simple expressions for the roots of Γ(z). Indeed, for m = k, the negative
root of Γ(z) is z1 = −k (see (14)), while the other two are
z2,3 = p + s −w −ku ±
p
(−ku + p + s −w)2 −4kuw
2u
.
This also simplifies the expression for uSN, obtained by setting the discriminant in the last
equation to zero,
uSN(p) = p + s + w −2
p
w(p + s)
k
.
To eliminate the square root, we set p + s = 4w, leading to p = 4w −s and then u = w/k
along the saddle-node curve, while the roots become
z2,3 = k.
With these choices, and substituting xi = xC(zi), the Jacobian matrix (24) along the saddle-
node curve becomes
Ji =




−s
2
kq
−(k−1)s(c+k)
4k(k+v−1)

v(c+k)
0
−
k(v(c+2k−1)+(k−1)2)
v(c+k)




The Jacobian can be further simplified by setting q = s and k = c, leading to
Ji =



−s

(c−1)s

−(c+v−1)2
2v
0
−c(c+3v−2)+v−1
2v



One can easily see that d0 = det(Ji) = 0, confirming that we’re along the saddle-node
curve. A Bogdanov-Takens point along the saddle-node curve is further characterized by
24
d2d0 −d1 = 0, which implies d1 = 0. Calculating d1 as the sum of the second-order principal
minors of Ji we obtain
d1 = cs(2c(c + 3v −2) −v + 2)
2v
.
Solving d1 = 0 for v we obtain
v = 2(c −1)2
1 −6c
In summary, with the above choices for m, p, u, k, q and v we obtain a Bogdanov-Takens
point.
In order to formalize our findings and provide a rigorous result, we now recall some aspects
of the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation theory, which can be found in [12] and [19] and in the
references therein.
Consider system (30) where now ζ = (κ, χ) ∈V is a vector with two bifurcation param-
eters. Denote the characteristic polynomial of J(x, ζ) as in (31). A Bogdanov-Takens point
of (30) is a pair (x0, ζ0) ∈U × V that satisfies
f(x0, ζ0) = 0,
d0(x0, ζ0) = 0,
d1(x0, ζ0) = 0,
d2(x0, ζ0) ̸= 0.
Equivalently, a Bogdanov-Takens point is an equilibrium point x0 ∈U of (30) such that for
ζ0 ∈V , the matrix J(x0, ζ0) is similar to the matrix

A Bogdanov-Takens point (x0, ζ0) ∈U × V of (30) is transversal if the map
(x0, ζ0) 7−→(f(x, ζ), d1(x, ζ), d0(x, ζ))
is regular at the point (x0, ζ0), that is, the regularity condition R(x0, ζ0) ̸= 0, where

Since (x0, ζ0) is a Bogdanov-Takens point, there are eigenvectors Q0, P1 ∈R3 associated
with the zero eigenvalues of M = J(x0, ζ0) and satisfying MQ0 = 0 and M TP1 = 0, where M T
25
stands for the transpose of the matrix M. There are also generalized eigenvectors Q1, P0 ∈R3
such that MQ1 = Q0 and M TP0 = P1. These eigenvectors can always be chosen satisfying
the conditions
⟨Q0, P1⟩= ⟨Q1, P0⟩= 0,
⟨Q0, P0⟩= ⟨Q1, P1⟩= 1,
(36)
where ⟨·, ·⟩is the usual inner product in Rn.
Using the translation ¯x = x −x0 and for ζ = ζ0 define the function F by F (x) =
f (x + x0, ζ0) omitting the bar. The function F has Taylor series expansion around x = 0 up
to terms of order 2 of the form
F(x) = Mx + 1
2B(x, x) + O(∥x∥3),
with M = J(x0, ζ0) as before, O (∥x∥3) a function with Taylor series expansion starting with
at least cubic terms and

where ω = (ω1, ω2, ω3).
Based on the above notations and definitions, we can state the Bogdanov-Takens Bifur-
cation Theorem [12, 19].
Theorem 4. Consider system (30) and let (x0, ζ0) ∈U × V be a point satisfying:
a. (x0, ζ0) is a transversal Bogdanov-Takens point, where ζ0 = (κ0, χ0);
b. aBT = 1
2 ⟨P1, B (Q0, Q0)⟩̸= 0;
c. bBT = ⟨P0, B (Q0, Q0)⟩+ ⟨P1, B (Q0, Q1)⟩̸= 0.
Then system (30) undergoes a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation at (x0, ζ0). The dynamics of
(30) restricted to the two-dimensional central manifold is locally topologically equivalent to
the dynamics of the normal form
(
x′ = y,
y′ = β1 + β2x + aBTx2 + bBTxy,
where β1 and β2 are unfolding parameters of κ −κ0 and χ −χ0, respectively, and x, y ∈R.
The next result is an application of Theorem 4 to system (3).
26
Theorem 5. Consider the following choice of parameters

2(4c + 1),
q = s,
v = 2(c −1)2

Then system (3) undergoes a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation at (x0, y0, z0, p0, u0) with
x0 = 2(1 −6c)c
4c + 1
,
y0 = 1 −6c
4c + 1,
z0 = c,
p0 = 4w −s,
u0 = w
c ,
where x0, y0 and z0 are the coordinates of the equilibrium point and (p0, u0) is the bifurcation
parameter vector.
Proof. Keeping the notation used in (30), consider the vector field f = f(x, ζ) associated
with system (3) and given by
f(x, ζ) = (f1(x, ζ), f2(x, ζ), f3(x, ζ))

(39)
where the parameters w, c, m, k, s, q and v are chosen as in (38) and ζ = (p, u) is the
parameter vector.
When ζ = ζ0 = (p0, u0), where p0 = 4w −s and u0 = w/c, system (3) has three equilibrium
points
x0 = Ec =

,
x1 = E0 = (0, 0, 0),
x2 = ET = (0, 0, 1).

has a double zero eigenvalue λ1 = λ2 = 0 and an additional eigenvalue
λ3 = −1
4(1 −2(4c + 1)s).
(40)
Therefore (x0, ζ0) is a transversal Bogdanov-Takens point of system (3) since the regularity
condition is equivalent to
R(x0, ζ0) = c4(4c + 1)2(c(16c + 3) + 1)s3
16(c −1)
and the inequalities for c and s in (38) imply that both λ3 and R(x0, ζ0) are nonzero.
27
The eigenvectors Q0, Q1, P0, P1 ∈R3 associated with the double zero eigenvalue satisfying
MQ0 = 0, MQ1 = Q0, M TP1 = 0 and M TP0 = P1 and also the conditions (36) are given by

From (39) and (37) we obtain
B(y, z) = (B1(y, z), B2(y, z), B3(y, z)) ,
where
B1(y, z) = −2(6c −1)y3z3(s −4w) + (4c + 1)sz3(4cy2 −y1) + (4c + 1)sy3(4cz2 −z1)

B2(y, z) = −s(y2z3 + y3z2),
B3(y, z) =

n3(y, z) = (4c+1)2y1(4cz1+(7c−2)z3+z1)+(7c−2)(4c+1)2y3z1+(2c(4c(12c+7)−15)+3)y3z3.
It follows that the coefficients
aBT =
2(4c + 1)sw
2(4c + 1)s −1,
bBT = 128c4s2 + 8c3s(7s −2) + c2 (14s2 + s(16w −3) −8w) + c(2s −1)(s −6w) + (2 −4s)w
(c −1)c(2(4c + 1)s −1)2
,
calculated as in Theorem 4 are nonzero with the parameter choices (38). In fact, the claim is
easily verified for the coefficient aBT. However, for the coefficient bBT there is only one value
of w, namely,
wc = c (16c2 + 3c + 1) s(8cs + 2s −1)
2(1 −c)(4c + 1)(2s −1)
(41)
which makes it zero. But for 0 < c < 1/6, on the one hand 0 < wc < s if 0 < s < 1/(2(4c+1))
contrary to the condition w > s and on the other hand wc < 0 if 1/(2(4c + 1)) < s < 1/2.
So the theorem is proved.

Figure 4 shows the bifurcation diagram of (3) for the numerical choice of parameters
v = 289/20, w = 1/2, m = k = c = 3/20, q = s = 9/20, which satisfies (38). In this case a
Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation occurs when ζ0 = (p0, ζ0) = (31/20, 10/3) and the coordinates
of the equilibrium point under these conditions are x0 = 3/160, y0 = 1/16 and z0 = 3/20.
In particular, Theorem 5 implies that, in the vicinity of the bifurcation parameters, the
Hopf bifurcation found by Theorem 3 is supercritical, providing an analytical proof for the
numerical results showing stable limit cycles around the tumor control equilibrium.
The parameter choices made in (38) for the occurrence of a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation
in the CAR-T model (3) are by no means the most general ones. However, these choices avoid
a numerical analysis and show that degenerate cases can occur in this model. For example,
there is a value s > 0 for which λ3 given in (40) is zero, possibly giving rise to a triple zero
eigenvalue bifurcation. There are also choices for the positive parameters c and s that make
wc given in (41) greater than s, and therefore the coefficient b can change sign at w = wc
providing either a new bifurcation diagram when w ̸= wc or a degenerate Bogdanov-Takens
bifurcation when w = wc. However, these aforementioned cases will not be studied here nor
will other bifurcations such as Bautin (or degenerate Hopf bifurcation), cusp and zero-Hopf
bifurcation, which seem to exist based on numerical evidence.
4. Discussion
The relatively recent advent of CAR-T cell therapy has opened new avenues for math-
ematical modeling.
The need to better understand the underlying mechanisms, quantify
clinical and pharmacokinetic variables, and the availability of robust data has spurred the
development of various models capturing several aspects of CAR-T cell therapy [2, 3, 4, 5,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Some studies have developed approaches to
predict long-term therapy outcomes based on short-term responses, but this remains chal-
lenging [4, 23, 26, 33, 34, 35, 36]. Few studies have conducted a deep qualitative analysis
of the nonlinear dynamics in CAR-T cell therapy, which can provide insights into long-term
outcomes [29, 30, 31]. However, these studies often focused on simplified models or lacked in-
tegration with clinical data. This study addresses this gap by rigorously analyzing a complex
model that describes real patient data over both short and long-term responses. While the
short-term behavior of our model was studied in [4], providing insights into the multiphasic
kinetics observed in the first weeks after CAR-T cell injection, here we explore the long-
term behavior by examining the various bifurcations that occur in the permanent system
associated with our model.
Our findings on this nonlinear dynamics that unfold in CAR-T cell therapy provide im-
portant biological insights and suggest that complex tumor-immune interactions can lead
to nonintuitive outcomes. Namely, the nontrivial dependence on the initial tumor burden
required for tumor control in the bistable regime, the role of increased CAR-T cell expansion
in driving oscillatory rather than damped tumor control via a Hopf bifurcation, and the in-
fluence of tumor-induced immunosuppression in transforming oscillatory tumor control into
transient control followed by escape via a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Similar phenomena
have been reported in earlier work on tumor-immune interactions. For example, tumor escape
for a small initial number of tumor cells, described by Kuznetsov as the ”sneaking through”
phenomenon [37], where small numbers of tumor cells evade immune response while larger
29
numbers are eliminated. Delayed tumor escape, where the trajectory initially approaches the
unstable tumor control equilibrium before escaping, was also described by Delgado et al. [38]
in their bifurcation analysis of the minimal model of immunoediting by DeLisi and Rescigno
[39].
Our model contains two nonlinear terms that appear to be responsible for most of its
complex dynamics, namely the expansion of CAR-T cells and the killing of tumor cells.
To better understand their role, it is instructive to compare this model with the three-
dimensional ODE model for CAR-T cell therapy in preclinical studies analyzed by one of us
in [29]. There are two primary structural differences between that model and model (2). Using
the notation of (2), the first difference is in the expansion of effector CAR-T cells. In [29],
this is described by an exponential growth term rminCT. In contrast, our model incorporates
the tumor cell presence by describing expansion as rminCTT/(A + T), meaning CAR-T cells
must bind to antigen-expressing tumor cells to expand. This nonlinear response aligns with
classical T cell biology [40] and established models of T cell expansion dependent on antigen
recognition [41, 42, 7]. The second difference lies in the tumor cell killing mechanism. While
[29] uses a mass action term −γCTT, our model uses −γCTT/(a + CT + dT), a modified
Holling type II functional response with an additional CT term, also known as a Beddington-
DeAngelis response [43]. This modification accounts for the saturation of tumor cell killing
due to the limited number of receptors on the surface of CAR T cells and the resulting
competition among CAR T cells to bind to tumor cells. Therefore, the model in [29] can be
seen as a linearization or limit case of our system (2). It is worth to note that the bifurcation
diagram in [29] is structurally similar to the simplest case here (Figure 2), featuring regions of
tumor escape, control, and bistability, but no limit cycles. Thus, we conclude that the refined
formulation of these terms is system (2) leads to the more complex nonlinear dynamics with
Hopf and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations, as shown in Figures 3 and 4.
This complexity comes at the cost of interesting mathematical challenges. The third-
degree polynomial equation for the nontrivial equilibria presents a challenge for analyzing
their existence and stability. We addressed this by parameterizing the bifurcation curves
and manipulating the coefficients of the Jacobian matrix. To explore the loss of stability
at the tumor control equilibrium point and potential Hopf bifurcation, we used Liu’s cri-
terion to characterize the Hopf bifurcation manifold. By parameterizing it through solving
a two-dimensional algebraic system, we derived an analytical expression for the Hopf lo-
cus. Additionally, by imposing conditions on model parameters and eliminating parameters
m, k, q, v, we simplified expressions to provide an analytical proof of the Bogdanov-Takens
bifurcation. This combination of techniques enabled a balance between a general description
of the parameter space and a detailed analysis of specific subsets. Indeed, while Liu’s ap-
proach applied to the full parameter space without simplifications but did not indicate the
nature of the Hopf bifurcation, the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation analysis under simplified
conditions inferred that the Hopf bifurcation is supercritical.
In summary, this work provides critical insights into the understanding of CAR-T cell
therapy by dissecting the nonlinear dynamics of a validated model arising from the complex
interplay between CAR-T cells and tumor cells. It also illustrates how combining different
mathematical approaches can effectively address nonlinear systems.
