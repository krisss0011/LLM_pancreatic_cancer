ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer, though most patients have a positive
prognosis with many experiencing long-term survival with current treatment options. Yet, each
treatment carries varying levels of intensity and side effects, therefore determining the severity of
prostate cancer is an important criteria in selecting the most appropriate treatment. The Gleason score
is the most common grading system used to judge the severity of prostate cancer, but much of the
grading process can be affected by human error or subjectivity. Finding biomarkers for prostate cancer
Gleason scores in a quantitative, machine-driven approach could enable pathologists to validate their
assessment of a patient cancer sample by examining such biomarkers. In our study, we identified
biomarkers from multi-omics data using machine learning, statistical tools, and deep learning to train
models against the Gleason score and capture the most important features that could potentially serve
as biomarkers for the Gleason score. Through this process, multiple genes, such as COL1A1 and
SFRP4, and cell cycle pathways, such as G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, and the PLK1 pathways,
were found to be important predictive features for particular Gleason scores. The combination of
these analytical methods shows potential for more accurate grading of prostate cancer, and greater
understanding of biological processes behind prostate cancer severity that could provide additional
therapeutic targets.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer, where 6 in 10 prostate cancer patients are above the age
of 65 [6]. Standard care treatments include surgeries, e.g. prostatectomy, and therapies targeted at cancer cells such
as radiation and cryotherapy [2, 7, 9]. Although these treatments are effective, given the long term survival of most
prostate cancer patients, they may harm the patients’ quality of life and can be unnecessarily severe in those cases where
only more mild treatments are required [6]. To provide more fitting treatments commensurate with disease severity,
prostate cancer needs to be better understood and modeled more accurately.
The severity of prostate cancer is measured using the Gleason score. Gleason scores are determined by a pathologist
assessing a tissue sample and assigning a primary and secondary grade from 1 to 5 based on how aggressive the cells
appear, with 1 being the least severe and 5 being the most [10, 4]. Primary and secondary grade patterns of less than 3
are rare, thus the addition of the two grades, which forms the final Gleason score, generally falls between 6 and 10.
Although the Gleason score is a valuable clinical tool, the process of measuring the Gleason score can be made more
accurate. Studies have shown that many structures in prostate cancer can alter the Gleason score, leading to over- or
undergrading [48, 11]. Variability in the prediction of the Gleason score shows that this process is subject to human
errors. To reduce such errors, machine learning can be used to predict the Gleason score in a more accurate and reliable

manner [34]. An explainable machine learning approach will also be able to identify important features and discover
biomarkers that may explain prostate cancer severity or grading.
Machine learning and deep learning methods have been used to predict the Gleason score with reasonable success,
though these efforts have been focused primarily on image analysis. One such study used radiomic features coupled
with a Random Forest classifier [15]. Specifically, MRI imaging was used to find regions of interest, and radiomic
features were extracted from the regions to predict the Gleason score using the random forest classifier. The results of
the study showed high accuracy (57.89% - 84.00%) across all folds and noted significant importance in two radiomic
features, entropy and sum entropy. These results were consistent with previous studies where the entropy correlated
with the Gleason score, and was also consistent with other studies that viewed the Gleason score as the default indicator
between benign and malignant prostate cancer.
Deep learning technology has also been used to predict the Gleason score. In one study, a two-stage deep learning
system was developed [50]. In the first stage, the model was trained to predict the Gleason pattern, and in the second
stage, the pattern prediction was used to predict the Gleason grade group (1,2,3,4,5). With a validation dataset of 331
images from their patient cohort, they found that this deep learning approach had a higher accuracy of 0.70 compared to
the mean accuracy of 0.61 for pathologists independently grading the same images and also had a lower mean average
error when predicting Gleason patterns. Other studies using imaging of prostate cancer have also found deep learning
approaches are effective at predicting the Gleason score and can potentially be assistive tools for both analyzing biopsies
and improving prostate cancer diagnosis, especially when higher level expertise is not available [51, 64].
These prior works focused on a single data modality. In our study, we consider multiple data modalities, specifically
multiple omic data types, to improve Gleason score prediction and to identify biomarkers. Our contributions are in two
aspects. First, we leveraged whole-exome sequencing and RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Program. Each of these omics datasets can have information that is domain specific, so models using multiple omics
datasets together can potentially find biomarkers that maximize information from across modalities. Second, we
focused on two different machine learning techniques. The first is a Random Forest (RF) model to identify features that
are important for predictions. These random forest models have shown themselves highly effective when analyzing
multi-modal biological data. The second is a deep learning method for modeling gene expression data, Transformer for
Gene Expression Modeling (T-GEM), that was developed for predicting cancer types [76]. By using machine learning
models to predict the Gleason score, important biomarkers, whether as single gene markers, gene sets, or signatures,
can be identified to provide potentially more consistent prostate cancer grading as well as additional therapeutic targets.

Methods and Procedures
2.1
Data pre-processing
Prostate cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons
(GDC) on April 4th, 2022[12][3]. We downloaded pre-processed RNA-Seq (transcripts per million (TPMs)), gene-level
copy number (CN), and mutation annotations (MuTect2 VCFs) data, as well as relevant clinical and sample information.
RNA-seq data was log2 transformed with a +1 pseudocount. CN data was log2 normalized, cnlog = log2(cn/2),
where cn is the measured copy number. Mutations were filtered to exclude silent mutations and mutations in the intron,
5’UTR, or 3’UTR. The mutation data were processed at the gene level as the absolute mutational load per gene after
filtration. Patient samples were filtered for those with complete clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic data. The feature
space for each of the modalities varied: RNA-seq data - 19938 genes, mutation data - 18701 genes, and CN data - 59104
elements, including entities such as genes, pseudogenes, miRNAs, etc. Two methods were used to filter the gene feature
space. The first method used common cancer genes from the Cancer Gene Census to subselect the gene space[65].
The second method used a z-score of the feature importance value from the RF model that was greater than a given
threshold. Filtration method was dependent on the experiments performed. Gene sets for the Hallmark and C2CP gene
set collections were downloaded from the GSEA Human Molecular Signatures Database website in July 2023 [5].
2.2
Random Forest classifier
The random forest algorithm was used as a classifier to predict the Gleason score per sample using gene-level
features as input. The sklearn package (version 1.0.2) random_forest_classifier was used with the default parameters
(n_estimators=100, criterion="gini", max_depth=None, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1) along with a
random seed of 6. Binary classification setting and five-fold cross validation was used for model training and testing.
For cross validation, the k-fold shuffle parameter was set to true and the random seed was set to 6. To find the importance
values of each gene as assigned by the RF, the Gini importance value from the feature_importances_ attribute of the
model was used [8]. Genes and their importance values were retained for each of the five folds of the experiments

and then averaged to order genes from highest to lowest importance. Average importance values were filtered using a
z-score threshold for better interpretability during analysis.
2.3
Gene set analysis
The prerank function from the gseapy module (version 1.0.4) was used to identify gene pathway significance for each
Gleason score in the dataset. Parameters: rnk = mean values of each feature for specified Gleason score in dataset
sorted in descending order, gene sets = hallmark pathway database or C2CP pathway database, minimum gene set size =
10, maximum gene set size = 500, permutation number = 1000, seed = 6. The full dataset was used without filtering
when performing GSEA. GSEA was performed in two experimental designs: pairwise (e.g. 6 verses 9) or one-vs-all
(e.g. 6 vs 7, 8, 9). Positive NES scores would mean up-regulation in the higher Gleason score for pairwise comparisons
and up-regulation in the isolated Gleason score for one-vs-all comparisons.
The scipy.stats (version 1.7.3) hypergeom.sf function was used to calculate significance for gene sets in relation to
important genes found by the random forest classifier in various single-omic experiments. Parameters include the
intersection between the gene set and important gene list (k), intersection between gene space and the chosen gene
database (N), the size of the gene set (n), and the size of the important gene list (M).
2.4
T-GEM analysis
The T-GEM (Transformer for Gene Expression Modeling) model is a novel, interpretable deep learning model primarily
focused on gene expression data [76]. The utilization of self-attention that is characteristic of transformer models
enables T-GEM to model unordered input like gene expression data and learn gene-gene interactions. Furthermore,
the property of self-attention to make a new representation of a word within the entire context of a word sequence is
able to be applied to finding the importance of a gene in the context of prostate cancer severity. The T-GEM code was
downloaded from https://github.com/TingheZhang/T-GEM on August 9th, 2023 [76]. Settings included a head size of
5, batch size of 1, dropout rate of 0.3, learning rate of 0.0001, and an epoch size of 30. Input genes were filtered for the
top 2000 by variance.

Results
3.1
Characterizing the TCGA Prostate Adenocarcinoma Dataset
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project provides a comprehensive dataset of prostate cancer with multiple data
types and corresponding clinical information, such as the Gleason score, for 500 patients[12].
We observed that the patient Gleason score distribution was quite imbalanced (Figure 1) with Gleason 7 representing
half of the cohort and Gleason 9 a third. There were too few patients with a Gleason score of 10, and these patients
were excluded from subsequent analyses. The number of elements and type of information each omics dataset contains
vary, which may affect model performance. We performed experiments using all features for a given data type, as well
as sub-selecting for 576 common cancer genes from the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) to reduce the gene space size [18].
By reducing the gene feature space, we aimed to reduce the complexity and increase interpretability of the predictive
models.

3.2
Random forest performance with single data modalities
We first evaluated the performance of the random forest model when only using one data type. Mutation data filtered
with cancer genes gave the highest median F1-score of 0.67 when predicting Gleason 6, though copy number data and
RNA data performed similarly (Figure 2). For Gleason 7, RNA data had the highest performance, achieving a median
F1-score of 0.70 when filtered with cancer genes. Copy number data exhibited similar performance, and mutation data
had the worst performance. For Gleason 8, no single-omic modality performed well. Lastly, for Gleason 9, RNA data
achieved the highest performance of any random forest experiment, with a median F1-score of 0.8 without any filters
(Figure 2). Overall, mutation data had the highest performance for Gleason 6, RNA data had the highest performance
for Gleason 7 and 9, and copy number data was generally comparable to the top performer for each Gleason score.
Filtering for cancer genes slightly improved performance depending on the data type and Gleason score being predicted.
For individual Gleason scores between 6 and 9, CHD4, ZFHX3, KMT2C, TSHR, and TP53 were cancer genes that had
some of the highest feature importance (Figure 3). Using RNA data filtered by cancer genes, SFRP4, COL1A1, DDIT3,
ZFHX3, CBFA2T3, and POLQ had the highest feature importance for predicting Gleason scores. Lastly, KIT, CBFA2T3,
and FANCA were found as the top features from copy number experiments when predicting Gleason 6. However, there
were no significantly important genes for predicting Gleason 7 or 9 when using copy number data filtered by cancer
genes.
3.3
Performance of multi-omics models
We then tested whether combining multiple data modalities would improve predictive performance. Models given
“filtered genes” only utilized genes from previous single data modality cancer gene filtered experiments that had a
feature importance value z-score ≥2. We found, using mutation data and CN data with z-score filtered cancer genes,
the RF achieved a median F1-score of 0.71 for predicting Gleason 6 (Figure 2). Using RNA and CN data with filtered
cancer genes, the RF reached an F1 of 0.75 for Gleason 7, though combining RNA and mutation data with filtered

cancer genes achieved similar levels of performance. A majority of the multi-omics models performed poorly when
predicting Gleason 8. The highest median F1-score was 0.62, where the features were either RNA and CN data with all
genes, or a combination of all three omics datasets with either all genes or filtered cancer genes. Most multi-omics
models had high performance when predicting Gleason 9 with the exception of those using mutation and CN data.
Using RNA and CN data with either all cancer genes or z-score filtered cancer genes gave the best performance for
Gleason 9.
Overall, models predicting Gleason 9 achieved the highest performance when combining data types, with models
predicting Gleason 7 having the second highest performance. While the highest multi-modal model performance
under-performed the highest performing single-modal model, overall model performance was higher for all Gleason
scores, particularly when predicting Gleason 8. However, the random forest’s ability to predict Gleason 8 remained
lower as compared to its predictive performance for the other Gleason scores. We found that z-score filtered cancer
genes gave better performance for predicting Gleason 7, but overall the use of cancer genes did not significantly affect
performance.
3.4
Biomarkers identified by Random Forest
Given transcriptomic data and the entire gene feature space, the random forest classifier model found hundreds of genes
that were important for Gleason scores 6-9. Looking at genes that had a z-score > 10, genes such as BGN, CENPU,
TACC3, PEBP4, ASF1B, MMP26, CDK1, and ACP3 were among the most significant by importance scores (Table 1).
We also observed that in multi-omics experiments the importance of transcriptomic features were much greater than
that of mutational load or CN. Across the multi-omics experiments, EZH2, COL1A1, USP6, SFRP4, DDIT3, EZH2,
EWSR1, TAL2, KMT2C, and ZFHX3 had the highest performances across Gleason scores (Figure 4, Table 5). Of these
genes, COL1A1 expression consistently had the highest importance for predicting Gleason 7 and 9, and USP6 had the

Enrichment Analysis
To identify whether there is an association between prostate cancer Gleason scores and particular biological processes,
we used two methods for set enrichment analysis (SEA) [19] to discover enriched gene sets amongst the most important
genes found by the random forest. SEA shifts the focus from individual genes to relevant gene groups, allowing for
greater identification of biological processes affecting the phenotype. First, we applied a hypergeometric test to capture
gene sets that are over-represented among the various features. Second, we utilized Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) to analyze differential expression of gene sets from the transcriptomic data to distinguish between Gleason
scores [67]. Shared gene sets found from hypergeometric test and GSEA analysis would validate hypergeometric test
results on transcriptomic data.
3.6
Hypergeometric test results
We considered first the Hallmark gene sets from the MSigDB for over-represented gene sets from important genes
selected by the random forest classifier in all gene experiments [40]. Only two gene sets consistently had significant
p-values(<0.05) across all z-score thresholds: G2M Checkpoint and E2F targets. Specifically, these gene sets only
appeared as significant for experiments using transcriptomic data. G2M checkpoint had its lowest p-value of 0.002
for Gleason 7 in the experiments using importance z-score thresholds of 5 and 20. G2M checkpoint was also over-
represented in genes significant for Gleason score 6 and 9 across multiple z-score thresholds. E2F targets had a
significant p-value of 0.040 for Gleason 7 in experiments using genes above z-score thresholds of 5 and 15. WNT
Beta-Catenin pathway had a significant p-value of 0.050 for Gleason 9 in mutation data experiments with a z-score
threshold of 15.
When performing the hypergeometric test on important genes from all gene experiments using the C2CP gene sets, we
identified many pathways related to the cell cycle that had p-values significant for Gleason score 9, including the PID
FOXM1 Pathway, Reactome Resolution of Sister Chromatid Cohesion, Reactome Mitotic Metaphase and Anaphase,
Reactome Mitotic Prometaphase, and PID PLK1 Pathway gene sets (Figure 5). These sets were significant across
feature importance z-score thresholds of 2, 5, and 10, showing how their signal persists as more significant genes are
used for the hypergeometric function (Figure 5).

E2F targets were consistently up-regulated in a higher grade Gleason score when compared to a lower grade (Table
2). We further found that Hallmark Spermatogenesis was up-regulated in Gleason 6 versus Gleason 8 cohorts, and
Hallmark Myogenesis was down-regulated in higher grade Gleason scores. The only C2CP gene sets to reach FDR
q-values < 0.15 were cell cycle pathways up-regulated for Gleason 9 in Gleason 7 versus Gleason 9. These include cell
cycle pathways such as PID PLK1 Pathway, Reactome Resolution of Sister Chromatid Cohesion, PID FOXM1 Pathway,
and Reactome Mitotic Prometaphase (Table 3). With both approaches, we find that cell cycle pathways are up-regulated
in higher grade prostate cancers.
To identify differentially expressed pathways that may be specific to a particular Gleason score, we performed one-
vs-all GSEA experiments. This approach discovers similar significant Hallmark gene sets (FDR q-value < 0.15)
found in the pairwise comparisons, including Hallmark G2M checkpoint, Hallmark E2F targets, and Hallmark
Myogenesis. Hallmark G2M checkpoint and Hallmark E2F targets were down-regulated in Gleason 6 and Gleason 7
while up-regulated in Gleason 9 (Table 4). Hallmark Myogenesis was down-regulated in Gleason 8 compared to other
Gleason scores. With C2CP gene sets, there was overlap between significant gene sets identified in GSEA one-vs-all

and down-regulation for Gleason 7.

T-GEM results
To further expand the set of biomarkers associated to specific Gleason scores, we utilized an AI model based on
transformers. Advanced deep learning models can have challenges in accurately fitting to the unique characteristics of
gene expression data because biological data is unordered and contains complicated gene-gene relationships. Moreover,
the "black box" nature of these models limits the interpretability of their results [76]. We applied an interpretable
deep learning model for modeling gene expression data, Transformer for Gene Expression Modeling (T-GEM), which
was developed for predicting cancer types. The T-GEM model has been shown to achieve an accuracy of 94.92%, a
Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9469, and an AUC of 0.9987, outperforming models such as Random Forest,
SVM, and CNN (Autokeras), in predicting cancer types [76]. Furthermore, the T-GEM model is able to discover gene
pathways specific to cancer phenotypes and provide attention to specific cancer-related genes.
In this study, we modified T-GEM to predict Gleason scores rather than cancer type and provided the top 2000 genes by
expression variance. During testing, we found that T-GEM performance was highly variable and did not effectively
converge during training. The model achieved the highest performance during epoch 25, reaching a test accuracy
of 0.644 and a validation accuracy of 0.595 (Figure 7). The T-GEM model identified genes such as BGN, SPARC,
RAMP1, C1QA, MAOB, SERPINF1, RHOU, CAMK2N1, HSPB1, C1S, BST2, RCAN3, and SFRP4 as positive markers
for Gleason 9 (Figure 6). Other genes, such as GDF15, H1-2, AQP3, TSPAN1, and ACP3 were found to have high
positive and negative importances across Gleason 6-9.

Our aim was to develop interpretable machine learning models to predict prostate cancer severity using Gleason scores
and to discover associated biomarkers from omics data, whether using single or multiple data modalities. We found that
using RNA-seq data, our models were able to predict Gleason 7 and 9 well, while mutational load data was able to
predict Gleason 6. Copy number data was consistently comparable to the top-performing data type for each Gleason
score. Depending on the data type and Gleason score being predicted, filtering the input data to the set of cancer genes
was able to improve performance. Moreover, model performance for all Gleason scores was improved when combining
data types. We observed that many of the important genes identified by the RF model have been previously found as
known biomarkers for prostate cancer severity, and our RF model also discovered additional potential biomarkers.
4.1
Significant biomarkers across single- and multi-omic random forest experiments
Throughout the random forest experiments, COL1A1, FANCA, FANCG, ZFHX3, USP6, SALL4, POLQ, KMT2C, EZH2,
SFRP4, and TP53 had some of the highest importance values for predicting Gleason scores, and these genes have all
been identified as potential biomarkers of prostate cancer prognosis and severity [23, 53, 69, 68, 37, 32, 26, 42, 27, 36,
58, 41, 29, 14, 28, 13, 61, 71, 74, 21]. Within these genes, COL1A1, ZFHX3, and USP6 were particularly significant.
ZFHX3 was distinctly associated with Gleason 6 in single-omics experiments using mutational load data and continued
to have importance for Gleason 6 in multi-omics experiments (Figures 3, 4). ZFHX3, which is also known as ATBF1,
has been shown to be a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer in multiple studies and losses of it is a strong sign of
uncontrolled prostate cancer growth [69, 68, 37]. ZFHX3 has frequent deletions and mutations in prostate cancer, which
the random forest model confirmed as ZFHX3’s mutational load was more informative compared to its expression and
copy number[69].

October 31, 2024
COL1A1 was among the strongest biomarkers the random forest model found, consistently performing at the top when
predicting Gleason 7 and Gleason 9 across both single- and multi-omics experiments(Figures 3, 4). COL1A1 (collagen
type I alpha 1 chain) has been shown to be a potential biomarker of prostate cancer in multiple studies, which have found
elevated COL1A1 expression levels in prostate cancer compared to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, exceptionally high
COL1A1 expression in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, significant COL1A1 up-regulation in BPS-treated
PC-3 cells, and definitive oncogenic properties [32, 26, 42, 39]. While there remains uncertainty as to the exact role of
COL1A1 in prostate cancer, we have validated its use as a prostate cancer biomarker, and specifically may serve as a
biomarker for Gleason 7 and 9.
We observed Gleason 8 was poorly predicted when using a single data type. However, a multi-omics approach
significantly boosted the performance. USP6 was consistently a top performing gene for predicting Gleason 8 in
multiple experiments that combined RNA data with other data types using z-score filtered cancer genes (Figure 4).
USP6 has been found to promote tumorigenesis through the JAK1-STAT3 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways [29]. Persistent
activation of JAK/STAT signaling correlates with tumor growth and disease progression in prostate cancer [14]. The
Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, is responsible for stimulating tumor progression in
multiple cancers, including prostate cancer [27, 28]. Through the support of various literature, there is a strong case for
COL1A1, ZFHX3, and USP6, the top performing genes found by the RF, as biomarkers for prostate cancer severity.
Our random forest model, which captured known prostate cancer biomarkers, identified additional potential biomarkers
for different Gleason scores, including TAL2, EWSR1, and DDIT3 that warrants future study. Studies suggest that 9q34
chromosome duplication may be linked to prostate cancer and TAL2 is a candidate for a prostate cancer gene from the
9q chromosome [37]. As TAL2 had significant feature importance only when the RF model was given copy number data
combined with other data types, the multi-omic model may have potential to capture known copy number markers and
identify these features within multiple omic modalities. EWSR1 has been found to make a protein that can cooperate
with the ERG transcription factor protein to promote prostate cancer [52]. The gene SPOP triggers DDIT3 degradation,
and mutations of SPOP that are linked with prostate cancer are defective in DDIT3 degradation [75]. TAL2, EWSR1,
and DDIT3 have not had their relation with prostate cancer prognosis and severity thoroughly investigated. However,
based on their high feature importance in the results of this study, further research should be conducted in the future to
confirm how they affect prostate cancer severity.
While we show there is little impact on performance when filtering using cancer genes, we tested the space of all genes
to discover additional genes relevant to prostate cancer. Considering genes using RNA data, the random forest model
identified several that are up-regulated in prostate cancer, including CENPU, CENPA, TACC3, PEBP4, ASF1B, MMP26,
CDK1, and ACP3. These genes were not a part of the common cancer gene list from the CGC, yet have literature
supporting their overexpression within prostate cancer, highlighting the potential for machine learning models to detect
additional relevant prostate cancer genes from the complete 20,000 gene space [31, 56, 46, 24, 17, 54, 60, 25, 1].
4.2
Set enrichment analysis
We performed set enrichment experiments to identify the greater biological pathways and mechanisms that could be
primary drivers behind the prostate cancer phenotype and potentially capture biological processes over-represented
within the important genes the RF found.
Across set enrichment experiments utilizing either MSigDB’s Hallmark or C2CP gene sets, cell cycle gene sets were
consistently over-represented. G2M checkpoint and E2F targets gene sets were significantly over-represented among
random forest features across multiple z-score thresholds for Gleason 6, 7, and 9. In binary GSEA experiments, G2M
checkpoint and E2F targets were down-regulated for Gleason 6 and 7, yet up-regulated for Gleason 9 (4). Furthermore,
similar behaviors were observed in these differentially-expressed pathways from pairwise GSEA comparisons (Table
2). These patterns suggest both G2M checkpoint and E2F targets are positively correlated with increased severity of
prostate cancer (Table 4).
G2M checkpoint up-regulation in higher severity prostate cancer aligns with the pathway’s biological function. The G2M
checkpoint pathway prevents cells from entering mitosis when DNA is damaged, providing an opportunity for repair
and stopping the proliferation of damaged cells [66]. G2M checkpoint pathway genes would have higher expression
in higher grade prostate cancer, where there is an increased need to mitigate the growth of cancer cells. In studies of
breast cancer, higher G2M checkpoint pathway activity was correlated with enriched tumor expression of other cell
proliferation-related gene sets, highlighting the enrichment of G2M checkpoint in more aggressive cancers [55].
Similarly, E2F transcription factors regulate the cell cycle through the activation of genes important for the G1 to S
phase cell cycle transition and are also involved in the activation of cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, DNA repair,
DNA damage and G2/M checkpoints, chromosome transactions, and mitotic regulation [59]. E2F transcription factors
have been shown to significantly affect the aggressiveness of prostate cancer, where increased E2F gene expression had
12
October 31, 2024
a strong association with greater risk of death [22]. Furthermore, E2F targets-related genes, including PLK1, have high
prognosis value for prostate cancer and high-risk groups formed from an E2F targets gene signature demonstrate poor
disease outcome, resistance to treatments, immunosuppression, and abnormal growth characteristics [73].
We observed enrichment of additional cell cycle gene sets from the C2CP database in the top features from the
random forest, including PID FOXM1 Pathway, Reactome Resolution of Sister Chromatid Cohesion, Reactome Mitotic
Metaphase and Anaphase, Reactome Mitotic Prometaphase, and PID PLK1 Pathway, for Gleason 9 in hypergeometric
tests and GSEA experiments (Figure 5, Tables 3 and 4). The FOXM1 transcription factor has been found to promote
tumorigenesis by promoting cell cycle progression through direct proliferation-driving targets like c-Myc (MYC) [35].
Furthermore, the FOXM1 transcription factor has been found to be highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and has
been shown to promote prostate cancer progression by regulating PSA gene transcription [43]. Overexpression of PLK1
has been found to override mitotic checkpoints, which can lead to immature cell division with aneuploidy, and also
contributes to cancer development by promoting excessive cell proliferation through the dysregulation of checkpoint
functions [38]. PLK1 regulates proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation, while the inhibition of PLK1 has
been shown to lead to greater effectiveness of cancer treatment[47, 62, 33].
The over-representation of cell cycle gene sets within top features of the random forest from both Hallmark and C2CP
gene sets highlights the importance of these pathways in prostate cancer progression. These enrichment results are
further supported by GSEA experiments. GSEA shared the same gene space as hypergeometric test, which encompassed
the entire prostate cancer dataset without any cancer gene-related filters. After analysis on all 19,000+ genes, the
aforementioned cell cycle gene sets were shown to be significantly differentially expressed. Specifically, these pathways
tended to be over-expressed in high grade prostate cancer. The agreement between the hypergeometric test and GSEA
highlights the cell cycle pathways’ value as biomarkers of prostate cancer severity and may represent potential targets
for therapeutic development.
4.3
Biomarkers from transformer based analysis
T-GEM was leveraged as an alternative model for discovering prostate cancer biomarkers from expression data. It
was able to identify many genes positively associated to Gleason 9, including BGN, SPARC, RAMP1, C1QA, MAOB,
SERPINF1, RHOU, CAMK2N1, HSPB1, C1S, BST2, RCAN3, and SFRP4 (Figure 6). 6 of 13 genes (BGN, SPARC,
MAOB, RHOU, HSPB1, and SFRP4) have been shown to be overexpressed in high severity prostate cancer, and RAMP1
has been shown to have high expression in prostate cancer overall [13, 61, 30, 45, 70, 72, 20, 44]. SFRP4 was also
identified by the random forest to be a potential biomarker for Gleason 9, further supporting its role as a marker for
higher prostate cancer severity (Figures 3 and4).
T-GEM further identified genes associated to the other Gleason scores, including AQP3, TSPAN1, GDF15, MYC, and
ACP3 (Figure 6). AQP3 has been found to increase prostate cancer cell motility and invasion[16]. TSPAN1 has been
shown to be driven by androgen in prostate cancer and increases cell survival and motility, which would lead to the
spread of the cancer [49]. GDF15 plays a critical role in the development of prostate cancer bone metastasis [63].
MYC is a known oncogene and contributes to the development of prostate cancer [57]. ACP3 encodes prostatic acid
phosphatase (PAP), which is a marker that can be used to diagnose and monitor prostate cancer[25]. Furthermore, ACP3
mRNA levels could be used to identify prostate cancer subtypes [25]. ACP3 was also identified by the all genes random
forest classifier to be an important biomarker for Gleason 9 (Table 1).
We do recognize that T-GEM experiments were inconsistent, with test and validation accuracy widely varying between
epochs. As neural network models typically require a great deal of training data, the 500 prostate cancer samples
included within the TCGA-PRAD dataset may not have been enough to sufficiently train the T-GEM model. A future
line of work would be to study whether the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) designed to generate more
training samples could be beneficial. Through the use of GANs, the T-GEM model would have greater available training
cases and could possibly improve its performance.
Despite T-GEM’s performance challenges that were likely the result of the limited sample size, this neural network
approach was still able to identify biomarkers for Gleason scores with supporting evidence from literature for their
association to prostate cancer. It was also able to recover biomarkers also discovered by the random forest, including
ACP3, MYC, and SFRP4 (Figures 3 and 6, Table 1). These genes should be further studied as potential therapeutic
treatments in prostate cancer. Our results demonstrate the promise of neural network approaches to find biomarkers
provided there is sufficient data.

Conclusion
Our study aimed to discover potential biomarkers for predicting prostate cancer Gleason scores, using two different
machine learning approaches along with clinical and multi-omic data. We found that individual data types were able to
predict particular Gleason scores successfully and validated several top ranking biomarkers in the literature. Moreover,
by combining datasets together, we were able to identify biomarkers that went unnoticed when using a single data type.
By combining different approaches and analyses we found multiple genes, such as COL1A1 and SFRP4, and cell cycle
pathways, such as G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, and the PLK1 pathway, that were important predictive features for
particular Gleason scores. The combination of these approaches shows the potential for easier, unbiased grading of
prostate cancers, and for greater understanding of the biological processes behind prostate cancer severity that could
provide novel therapeutic targets.
