ABSTRACT
Multimodal imaging has shown great potential in cancer research by concurrently providing anatomical, func-
tional, and molecular information in live, intact animals. During preclinical imaging of small animals like mice,
anesthesia is required to prevent movement and improve image quality. However, their high surface area-to-
body weight ratio predisposes mice, particularly nude mice, to hypothermia under anesthesia. To address this,
we developed a detachable mouse scanning table with heating function for hybrid x-ray and optical imaging
modalities, without introducing metal artifacts. Specifically, we employed Polylactic Acid (PLA) 3D printing
technology to fabricate a customized scanning table, compatible with both CT and optical imaging systems. This
innovation enables seamless transportation of the table between different imaging setups, while its detachable
design facilitates maintaining a clutter-free operational environment within the imaging systems. This is crucial
for accommodating various projects within the same scanner. The table features positioned fixation points to
secure mice, ensuring positional consistency across imaging modalities. Additionally, we integrated a carbon
nanotube-based heating pad into the table to regulate the body temperature of mice during examinations, pro-
viding an ethical and effective temperature maintenance solution. Our evaluations confirmed the table’s ability
to maintain a 30g water bag at approximately 40℃, effectively regulating mouse body temperature to an optimal
36℃during preclinical imaging sessions. This scanning table serves as a useful tool in preclinical cancer research,
offering a versatile tool that upholds animal welfare standards.

1. INTRODUCTION
Multimodal imaging has great potential in preclinical research because it allows the concurrent acquisition of
anatomical, functional, and molecular information in live and intact animals.1 One powerful combination is in
vivo imaging using X-ray computed tomography (CT) alongside optical imaging, which together can provide
enhanced and complementary insights into the progression and treatment of complex diseases, such as cancer2
that often exhibit highly intricate spatiotemporal characteristics, making it vital to leverage the strengths of both
imaging modalities. While CT is highly effective for visualizing the geometry and anatomy of animal tissues,
as well as for detecting contrast materials, optical imaging excels in delivering functional information, such as
tissue oxygenation and metabolic activity.
A critical consideration during such imaging procedures is ensuring that the animal’s position remains stable
and consistent across different imaging modalities. To achieve this, it is advantageous to use a scanning table
that can be easily transported between systems, allowing the animal to remain in situ throughout the imaging
process and facilitating straightforward image registration across different imaging platforms.
Regardless of the system-specific table designs, one essential aspect is the need to maintain the animal’s body
temperature during the imaging process. Anesthesia, commonly used in preclinical imaging, often leads to a
significant drop in body temperature, especially in small rodents. They are prone to rapid heat loss due to their
high surface area-to-volume ratio.3 In addition, animals can experience further heat loss due to the typically
cool environments of imaging rooms, the scanners themselves, and the delivery of cool anesthetic carrier gases.

Without active heating, the combination of these factors can quickly lead to hypothermia, which may impact
the physiology and thus the outcomes of the experiment.
Several methods for maintaining body temperature during imaging have been proposed, including circulating
warm liquids or air4,5 using pre-warmed heat pads, and employing metallic heating resistors.6 Although each
of these methods can offer thermal support, many of them are unsuitable for use with micro-CT or optical
scanners. Large heating devices can be impractical due to space constraints in the imaging apparatus, while
others can cause image distortion, particularly in CT scanners where metallic components can introduce serious
artifacts. For example, circulating warm liquids or air requires additional space within the scanner and poses
challenges due to continuous heat loss during delivery, necessitating a high power demand to maintain adequate
temperature. Pre-warmed heat pads, while more compact, cannot provide consistent heat over the duration of
the imaging process, as they gradually return to room temperature. Metallic heating pads, although capable of
maintaining constant heat, pose a significant problem for CT imaging due to the generation of metal artifacts,
which compromise image quality.7
Here, we present a 3D-printed scanning table that can be transported between CT and optic imaging sys-
tems keeping position of mouse constant with heating system using carbon nanotube heater which presents no
detectable image artifacts.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 3D-printed Table
To address the need for a compact table suitable for both micro-CT and optical imaging, we designed a mouse
table in CAD and constructed it using Polylactic Acid (PLA) 3D printing technology. The table’s design includes
a base that connects to the gantry of the scanner, a detachable bed, and a transparent cover. The base can be
securely attached to the CT scanner gantry via an interface connector, which also accommodates wiring and
tubing within the scanner.
The supporting bar holds the detachable bed, where the mouse is positioned during scanning. When switching
from CT to optical imaging, the bed can be easily removed from the CT scanner and placed on a microscope.
The transparent cover improves observation of the mouse’s position and helps maintain its alignment during
scanning. The dimensions of the table are compact—75mm in width, 30mm in height—with a cross-sectional
area slightly larger than the average mouse size, ensuring short imaging durations. The length of the table is
adjustable from 180mm to 260mm, allowing flexible positioning for various imaging needs. Furthermore, the
base is designed to be easily detachable from the scanner gantry, enabling versatility across different imaging
projects. Figure 1a and 1b show the conceptual and real-life images of the designed system.
2.2 Carbon Nanotube Heater
The heating system employs a flexible carbon nanotube-based electrothermal film heater, known for its high
efficiency, minimal operational noise, and excellent safety profile. The system comprises three layers, with the
central layer acting as the heating element, providing uniform heating across its surface. The outer layers serve
as protective barriers, ensuring safe and effective operation. The heater operates at 5V and 10W, delivering
safe, low-voltage performance, with no associated safety risks. The heating pad features a 99% electrothermal
conversion rate and emits heat in the far-infrared spectrum, which enhances its efficiency while ensuring safe
and effective warming. With a lifespan of up to 50,000 hours, the system is designed for long-term, reliable use.
The heating pad’s flexible nature allows it to conform to the shape and dimensions of the scanning bed. It is
placed on the bottom surface of the bed, topped with a sponge mat that contours to the mouse’s body, ensuring
consistent positioning. An additional layer between the heating pad and the mouse prevents potential burns
from overheating. The heating pad is powered via an extension cord connected at the gantry.
3. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
3.1 Homeothermic Maintenance in Simulation Testing
To evaluate the heating pad’s performance, surface temperature measurements were first taken using an infrared
thermometer to assess the heating efficiency at steady state. Subsequently, a simulation test was conducted
to assess its efficacy in maintaining homeothermic conditions. In this test, a 40g water bag, simulating the
thermal mass of a mouse, was placed on the heating pad. Internal temperature measurements of the water bag
were recorded at 5-minute intervals over a 180-minute period using a digital thermometer. The ambient room
temperature was maintained at 24°C, with the initial temperature of the water bag also at approximately 24°C.
Figure 2 shows the experimental setup for homeothermic maintenance testing.

Figure 3 illustrates the temperature profiles of the water bag during three independent trials.
The core
temperature of the water bag showed a steady increase over time. Within 20 minutes, the temperature rose
from 24°C to over 30°C, demonstrating the system’s efficiency in raising the temperature in a short period of
time. The target temperature was set at 40°C, representing a typical homeothermic range.8 This target was
successfully reached within 45 minutes, indicating a consistent and controlled rate of temperature increase.
Once the target temperature of 40°C was achieved, the system maintained the water bag’s temperature
within a narrow range of 40°C ± 2°C for the next 135 minutes. This stability demonstrates the system’s ability
to maintain a homeothermic condition over an extended period, which is critical for ensuring consistent heating
temperature during the imaging session.
Most imaging period was intentionally kept under 3 hours, as the
system was able to provide stable thermal maintenance throughout the entire duration.

3.2 CT Imaging and Compatibility
To validate the compatibility of the 3D-printed table with CT imaging, a sacrificed mouse was scanned using
the MARS-19 photon-counting micro-CT scanner. Scans were performed at 118kVp and 12µA,9 confirming that
the table did not introduce any artifacts, and ensuring that it is suitable for hybrid imaging applications.
In the reconstructed CT images (Figure 5), some bright lines are observed, corresponding to the cross-
sectional images of carbon nanotubes used in the heating pad beneath the mouse. These carbon nanotubes
exhibit higher brightness than other components in the image, causing minor streak artefacts. However, these
artefacts do not intersect with the mouse image and do not affect the visualization of the mouse’s anatomical
structures. The high-quality imaging of the mouse allows for accurate assessment of internal anatomy without
distortion, enabling precise measurements and observations throughout the experiment. This clarity in imaging
further supports the reliability of the experimental setup for future applications requiring detailed anatomical
assessments.
4. DISCUSSION
We successfully developed a novel, customized, detachable scanning table that is compatible with both X-
ray computed tomography (CT) and optical imaging systems. This design addresses several critical needs in
preclinical imaging, particularly in the context of multimodal imaging where maintaining the animal’s position
between systems and providing consistent thermal support are essential for reliable and repeatable results.
Our experiments confirmed that the integrated carbon nanotube-based heating system was able to effectively
regulate temperature at 40°C for up to 3 hours, which exceeds the duration of typical imaging sessions. Maintain-

ing consistent body temperature during preclinical imaging is crucial, as small animals are highly susceptible to
hypothermia when anesthetized. The stable thermal environment provided by the heating pad ensures that the
physiological conditions of the mouse remain as close to normal as possible during imaging, thereby minimizing
any potential temperature-related physiological deviations that could affect experimental outcomes. This level
of temperature regulation also highlights the system’s potential for use in a range of preclinical studies where
prolonged imaging sessions are required.
Another significance of our scanning table is its ability to function without introducing image distortions,
particularly metal artifacts during CT imaging, which are commonly associated with traditional heating pads
that utilize metallic heating resistors. The carbon nanotube heater in our system did not interfere with CT image
quality, as confirmed by our experiments using the MARS-19 photon-counting micro-CT scanner. The absence of
metal artifacts ensures high-quality imaging, preserving the anatomical details necessary for accurate assessments.
The compatibility of the scanning table with both imaging modalities allows for seamless integration into hybrid
imaging setups, ensuring that data from different modalities can be accurately registered and compared.
In addition to its functional advantages, the 3D-printed scanning table offers integration with existing preclin-
ical CT systems. Designed with adjustable dimensions and mounting points, the CAD model can be customized
to fit a variety of scanners beyond the MARS19 model used in our study. Installation is straightforward and
requires no additional hardware, thus minimizing setup time and technical complications. Constructed from
lightweight and radiolucent PLA filament, the table does not interfere with imaging quality and facilitates easy
reproduction and customization using standard 3D printers. Importantly, the table does not necessitate any
changes to scanner calibration or imaging software, allowing existing imaging protocols to remain unaltered and
preserving consistency in experimental results. An consideration is the potential need for extension cords or
power adapters to connect auxiliary equipment like the heating pad and physiological monitoring devices within
the scanner environment.
Future work involves applying this system in live in-vivo preclinical hybrid X-ray and optical imaging of
mice, where this detachable scanning table will be employed to monitor complex diseases such as cancer. These
in-vivo studies will be instrumental in demonstrating the full utility of the scanning table and its heating system.
Additionally, further validation of the system’s performance across different imaging modalities and experimental
conditions will help solidify its role in multimodal imaging setups.
Future developments may also explore
enhancements to the table’s design, such as optimizing its dimensions for different animal models or integrating
advanced materials for improved thermal insulation. One potential avenue for improvement involves making the
heating pad system more intelligent, incorporating real-time temperature monitoring from sensors attached to the
mouse. Based on the continuous data gathered from these sensors, the heating pad could automatically adjust its
heat output to maintain the mouse’s body temperature within an optimal range. This automated control system
would help ensure consistent thermal regulation throughout the imaging session, preventing fluctuations that
could impact physiological stability. Furthermore, expanding the table’s functionality to support more advanced
vital sign monitoring or to integrate automated control systems for adjusting both the heating and anesthesia
systems could further enhance its utility in preclinical research. These developments would not only improve
the overall efficiency of the experimental process but also contribute to better animal welfare by ensuring precise
and individualized temperature control during imaging.
