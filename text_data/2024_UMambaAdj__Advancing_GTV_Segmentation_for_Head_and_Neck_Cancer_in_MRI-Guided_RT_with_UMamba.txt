Abstract. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in
MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC)
due to its superior soft-tissue contrast. However, accurately segmenting
the gross tumor volume (GTV), which includes both the primary tu-
mor (GTVp) and lymph nodes (GTVn), remains challenging. Recently,
two deep learning segmentation innovations have shown great promise:
UMamba, which effectively captures long-range dependencies, and the
nnU-Net Residual Encoder (ResEnc), which enhances feature extrac-
tion through multistage residual blocks. In this study, we integrate these
strengths into a novel approach, termed ’UMambaAdj’. Our proposed
method was evaluated on the HNTS-MRG 2024 challenge test set using
pre-RT T2-weighted MRI images, achieving an aggregated Dice Sim-
ilarity Coefficient (DSCagg) of 0.751 for GTVp and 0.842 for GTVn,
with a mean DSCaggof 0.796. This approach demonstrates potential for
more precise tumor delineation in MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy, ul-
timately improving treatment outcomes for HNC patients. Team: DCPT-

Introduction
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in radiotherapy (RT),
particularly in MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy, due to its superior soft-tissue
contrast compared to other imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT).

This soft-tissue contrast enables more accurate delineation, which is especially
crucial in head and neck cancer (HNC), where the intricate anatomy and proxim-
ity of vital structures, such as the salivary glands, optic nerves, and spinal cord
[1,4], make precise tumor targeting critical. MRI’s ability to differentiate be-
tween tumor tissues and surrounding normal tissues enhances radiation delivery
accuracy, reducing the risk of collateral damage to critical structures [3,24,23].
Despite these advantages, accurate delineation of HNC tumors, including
both the primary tumor volume (GTVp) and involved nodal metastasis (GTVn),
remains challenging. The heterogeneous and diffuse nature of HNC tumors often
makes obtaining clear margins difficult [28,17]. Additionally, MRI’s lower spa-
tial resolution in the third dimension (through-slice direction) compared to the
in-plane resolution can complicate tumor delineation, leading to variability in in-
terpretation among clinicians and resulting in significant inter-observer variation
(IOV).
Given these challenges, there is a growing need for automated, accurate seg-
mentation methods to enhance the consistency and precision of tumor delin-
eation in MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy. Deep learning-based medical image
segmentation has emerged as a promising solution, often building on the classic
U-Net architecture, known for its symmetrical encoder-decoder design and skip
connections [27]. It plays a crucial role in medical image analysis by identifying
and delineating structures such as organs, lesions, tumors, and tissues across
various 2D and 3D imaging modalities, including CT, PET, and MRI, thereby
aiding in diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognoses.
Recently, the leading deep learning models for segmentation have shifted
between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based architec-
tures. CNNs excel at capturing translational invariances and local features but of-
ten face challenges with long-range dependencies [21]. In contrast, Vision Trans-
formers (ViTs) [8] effectively capture global context by treating the image as a
sequence of patches. However, their self-attention mechanism incurs a quadratic
computational cost relative to the number of patches [9], and Transformers tend
to be prone to overfitting, especially when working with limited datasets [19,13].
Leveraging the complementary strengths of both architectures, many studies
have explored hybrid models that integrate ViTs with CNNs, resulting in ar-
chitectures such as nnFormer [35], TransUNet [5], UNETR [12], SwinUNETR
[11], and UNETR++ [29]. These hybrid models have also gained popularity in
HNC GTV segmentation. For instance, Hung Chu et al. [6] demonstrated that
the SwinUNETR achieved an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.626
on CT/PET data, while a cross-modal Swin transformer achieved a mean DSC
of 0.769 for GTVp using CT/PET modalities [18]. Despite these advancements,
the U-Net architecture continues to be a foundational design in all segmentation
models.
The field is now advancing with structured state-space models (SSMs), such
as Mamba [10,9,7], which offer improved segmentation performance by efficiently
modeling long-range dependencies and scaling effectively with sequence length
[34,13]. Mamba’s ability to capture complex anatomical relationships makes it

well-suited for segmenting GTVp and GTVn in HNC, as their locations are often
closely correlated with each other. However, the optimal model configuration de-
pends on task-specific factors such as the foreground-to-background ratio, image
resolution, and tumor size variability, as each architecture’s effectiveness varies
with different imaging challenges and anatomical complexities.
Recently, two innovative approaches, UMamba [22] and the new nnU-Net
Residual Encoder (ResEnc) planner [15], have gained significant attention in
medical image segmentation. The default UMamba encoder incorporates a Mamba
layer after each CNN block, which can be computationally expensive, especially
at the first level where image features have a large resolution. This design, which
includes both a residual encoder and decoder, can be cumbersome to train and
provides only limited accuracy improvements in its default configuration [15].
In contrast, the nnU-Net ResEnc enhances feature extraction through multiple
blocks of residual CNN encoding and employs only a single CNN layer in the
decoder, offering a more efficient solution.
This study focuses on addressing the first task of the HNTS-MRG 2024 chal-
lenge, which aims to segment both GTVp and GTVn using pre-RT T2-weighted
MRI images. We aim to improve gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in T2-
weighted MRI for head and neck cancer by integrating the strengths of UMamba
and nnU-Net ResEnc. We refer to this integrated approach as UMambaAdj in
this study.
Our contributions are as follows:
– We optimize UMamba by removing the Mamba layer in the first stage and
the residual blocks in the decoder, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while preserving its ability to capture long-range dependencies in
deeper stages.
– We combine UMamba’s long-range dependency modeling with nnU-Net Res-
Enc’s enhanced residual encoding to improve the accuracy of GTV delin-
eation in the complex anatomy of head and neck cancer.

Material and Methods
2.1
Data
The dataset used in this study was provided by the organizers of the HNTS-
MRG 2024 challenge task 1, consisting of 150 HNC patients, primarily with
oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). Each patient had T2-weighted MRI sequences of
the head and neck region, acquired at University of Texas MD Anderson Can-
cer Center [30]. The images included pre-RT scans taken 1-3 weeks before the
start of radiotherapy. For all cases, GTV for the primary tumor (GTVp) and
involved lymph nodes (GTVn) were independently segmented by 3 to 4 expert
physician observers based on the MRI images. The ground truth segmentation
was then generated using the Simultaneous Truth And Performance Level Esti-
mation (STAPLE) algorithm.

Network Architecture
The proposed network architecture is based on a combination of a 3D ResEnc
U-Net and Mamba blocks. The CNN part of network architecture was designed
according to the new nnU-Net Residual encoder planner (M). The U-Net consists
of 6 stages, each with varying features per stage (32, 64, 128, 256, 320, 320). The
network uses 3D convolutional layers with kernel sizes mostly set to (3, 3, 3),
except for the first stage where it is (1, 3, 3). The strides vary across stages to
enable down-sampling at different levels, with a stride set of (1, 2, 2) between the
first and second stages, and (2, 2, 2) for the remaining stages. Each stage contains
a different number of residual CNN blocks with counts of (1, 3, 4, 6, 6, 6) in the
encoder, and a Mamba layer is appended after each residual CNN block except
the first stage. A skip connection with concatenation was connecting the Mamba
layer and the decoder blocks, while each decoder block consists of only one 3D
CNN block. Instance normalization and the Leaky ReLU activation function
are used. Additionally, deep supervision is applied at the top four levels of the
network outputs. The overall structure of the network can be seen in Figure 1a.

Mamba layer
The Mamba layer, adapted from the UMamba design for capturing long-range
dependencies, processes input image feature maps of shape (B, C, H, W, D),
where B is the batch size, C the channel, and H, W, D the spatial dimensions.
These feature maps are first reshaped and transposed into a flattened representa-
tion (B, L, C), where L = H ×W ×D, treating all spatial locations as individual

patch tokens. The reshaped features are then normalized using Layer Normal-
ization. Following normalization, the features undergo two parallel branches. In
the first branch, the features are expanded to (B, 2L, C) through a linear trans-
formation, followed by a 1D convolutional layer and a SiLU activation function,
ultimately passing through the SSM layer. In the second branch, a similar ex-
pansion process is performed via a linear transformation and a SiLU activation
function, but without the convolutional or SSM steps. The outputs from the two
branches are then combined using element-wise (Hadamard) multiplication. The
resulting features are projected back to the original token dimension, reshaped,
and transposed to restore the original input shape of (B, C, H, W, D), maintain-
ing the spatial structure of the image feature maps for further processing. The
detailed flow of a Mamba layer can be seen in Figure 1b.
2.4
Training Parameters
Training was conducted with a batch size of 4, using a patch size of (48, 192,
192) and Z-score normalization for data preprocessing. The median image size in
voxels was (123, 512, 511), with spacing set at (1.199, 0.5, 0.5). Resampling spline
interpolation functions were employed to adjust both image and segmentation
data, using an interpolation order of 3 for images and an order of 1 (linear) for
masks. The training was performed using the SGD optimizer with a PolyLR
scheduler (exponent = 0.9), starting with a learning rate of 0.01. The adoption
of the Mamba layer often led to gradient vanishing or explosion during training,
especially when using mixed-precision (fp16) with automatic casting. To address
this, normalized gradients were clipped with a value of 1.
The 150 patients were randomly divided into 5 folds, with each fold compris-
ing 120 patients for training and 30 for validation. Each model was trained for a
maximum of 1,000 epochs, and the final models from the last epoch were saved
for prediction. For the final challenge submission, predictions on the test set were
generated using an ensemble of all models trained across the five folds. In line
with reproducibility and verification guidelines [14], all source code, predicted
masks, training logs and trained weights have been made publicly available on
GitHub†.
2.5
Evaluation
The aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSCagg) [2] was used as the pri-
mary evaluation metric in accordance with the guidelines of the HNTS-MRG
2024 challenge. Additionally, we employed the mean 95th percentile Hausdorff
Distance (HD95), and the mean surface distance (MSD) as supplementary met-
rics to further evaluate the segmentation performance for both GTVp and GTVn.
Hausdorff Distance (HD) was used for case study.
To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compared both
the segmentation accuracy and training epoch times of the default nnU-Net,

nnU-Net Residual Encoder (ResEnc), UMamba Encoder (UMambaEnc), and
the proposed UMambaAdj using the DSCagg metric. Since the Mamba block
involves multiple tensor shape manipulations that are not fully represented by
FLOPs, we measured the stable epoch time after the first epoch as a direct
indicator of model efficiency. All compared groups were trained with a batch
size of 4.
2.6
System environment
The experiments were conducted on a system equipped with dual AMD Ryzen
Threadripper 3990X 64-core processors (128 threads) and 256GB of system mem-
ory. An NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU with 48GB VRAM was used for training.
The software environment included Python 3.12.4, PyTorch 2.4.0, CUDA 12.6
and nnU-Net 2.5.1. Distance metrics were calculated using SimpleITK 2.4.0.

Comparision of nnU-Net, ResEnc, UmambaEnc and
UmambaAdj
Table 3 summarizes the performance of various models for GTVp and GTVn seg-
mentation. For GTVp, the proposed UMambaAdj achieved the highest DSCagg
8
J. Ren et al.
(0.804) and the best results in terms of HD95 (5.7 mm) and MSD (2.6 mm).
In the case of GTVn, UMambaEnc achieved the highest DSCagg (0.880) and
outperformed others with the lowest HD95 (10.5 mm) and MSD (2.2 mm).
Two cases were selected for illustration in Figure 2. For patient (a), all meth-
ods except UMambaAdj predicted a significantly smaller GTVp (DSC range
0.277–0.584), with the lower part missing, whereas UMambaAdj achieved a
higher DSC of 0.703, despite all methods failing to capture the upper part.
Additionally, the default nnU-Net model incorrectly identified a lymph node as
GTVn, resulting in an HD of 75.2 mm, compared to 3.2–3.5 mm for the other
methods. For patient (b), all methods except UMambaAdj made false positive
predictions of GTVp in the same location. Moreover, all methods except UMam-
baEnc incorrectly predicted a lymph node as positive bilaterally, leading to an
HD of 60 mm.
The training epoch time for the nnU-Net default model was 116 seconds,
while the nnU-Net ResEnc took 127 seconds. The UMambaEnc required 400
seconds, and UMambaAdj took 199 seconds. Mixed-precision (fp16) autocast
was enabled for all layers, except the Mamba layer, to ensure training stability.
3.3
Final test score
We submitted our trained UMambaAdj models in a Docker container to the
HNTS-MRG 2024 challenge on the grand challenge platform. Predictions were
made using an ensemble of all five models trained across the 5-folds. Our model
was evaluated on the test set using pre-RT T2-weighted MRI images, achieving
an DSCagg of 0.751 for GTVp and 0.842 for GTVn, resulting in an overall mean
DSCagg of 0.796.

Discussion
In this study, we developed a customized network that integrates features from
both UMamba and the nnU-Net Residual Encoder for T2-weighted MRI head
and neck tumor segmentation. The aim was to combine the feature extraction
strength of the residual encoder with the long-range dependency capabilities of
Mamba blocks. Compared to the original UMambaEnc, the proposed UMam-
baAdj demonstrated comparable segmentation accuracy with reduced training
and inference time, and outperformed UMambaEnc for GTVp. It also achieved
significantly better HD95 and MSD while maintaining similar DSCagg compared
to nnU-Net ResEnc. All recent methods outperformed the default nnU-Net
model across all metrics, confirming the complementary strengths of UMamba
and nnU-Net ResEnc in the proposed approach.
The cross-validation and final test results revealed a notable performance
gap between the segmentation accuracy of the primary tumor (GTVp) and the
nodal disease (GTVn). Although the DSCagg for GTVn was substantially higher
than for GTVp, the HD95 and MSD metrics were significantly larger for GTVp.
UMambaAdj for Head and Neck Cancer Tumor Segmentation
9
This discrepancy suggests that the model struggled more with accurately delin-
eating the nodal boundaries or even on detecting the nodes, often due to falsely
predicted lymph nodes. These false predictions greatly influenced the distance
based metrics.
Our experiments demonstrated that models incorporating the UMamba block
achieved significant improvements in distance-based metrics (HD95 and MSD),
underscoring the value of long-range dependencies provided by the Mamba. This
capability is crucial for capturing the intricate structures of HNC tumors, where
understanding dependencies between primary tumors and metastatic lymph
nodes is vital. Notably, the proposed UMambaAdj model, which excludes the
Mamba block from the first stage, matched the ResEnc model’s DSCagg per-
formance while achieving HD95 and MSD metrics similar to UMambaEnc. This
suggests UMambaAdj effectively balances volumetric overlap and boundary de-
lineation, although GTVn results indicate a need for the Mamba layer in the
first stage.
The evaluation results show that while HD95 and MSD metrics vary signif-
icantly among the methods, DSCagg remains relatively consistent. This differ-
ence is due to the metrics’ sensitivities: DSCagg, being a global overlap measure,
is less affected by minor boundary discrepancies or isolated false predictions.
In contrast, HD95 is highly sensitive to boundary inaccuracies, making it more
responsive to small over-segmentation, under-segmentation, or isolated false pre-
dictions. This sensitivity makes these metrics more reflective of clinically rele-
vant errors, where even small false positives or negatives would be unacceptable.
This observation underscores the importance of employing multiple evaluation
metrics for a comprehensive assessment of segmentation performance. Although
DSCagg might be suitable as a single ranking metric in public challenges due
to its straightforward interpretation, relying solely on it can be misleading. The
best DSCagg method does not always correspond to the best overall segmenta-
tion performance, particularly in accurately capturing the boundaries or avoiding
false predictions—a critical factor in real-world clinical applications.
Despite the promising performance of the proposed UMambaAdj model, its
effectiveness must be validated on external datasets. Our current validation was
limited to a single fold from a single institutional dataset, and thus, further
testing on public datasets or other private datasets is essential to confirm the
generalizability and robustness of our approach. This need for broader valida-
tion is especially relevant given the rapid emergence of various Mamba-based
segmentation models since Mamba’s initial publication.
Recent adaptations, such as the “Swin” feature with Mamba [20], the tri-
oriented vision Mamba approach [33], and the Visual Mamba U-Net [31], have
shown that integrating Mamba with existing CNN blocks can lead to notable
segmentation accuracy, all claiming achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA). However,
some of these models still require significant modifications to match the 3D seg-
mentation performance of nnU-Net. Our adjustments based on UMamba indicate
that Mamba holds particular promise for HNC tumor segmentation, especially
for GTVn.
10
J. Ren et al.
Nevertheless, even with these advances, head and neck cancer tumor seg-
mentation remains a challenging task that is far from being a "solved" problem.
Fully automatic segmentation methods often face limitations that necessitate hu-
man intervention to ensure accurate treatment planning. In our study, despite
achieving decent DSCagg scores, even SOTA models struggled with accurately
identifying tumor locations, highlighting the persistent difficulties in this do-
main. The complex anatomy of the head and neck region, coupled with the
challenge of distinguishing tumors in T2-weighted images (as evidenced in the
GTVp cases from Figure 2), reinforces these challenges. Therefore, incorporat-
ing complementary information such as FDG-PET imaging [16,26], biopsy data,
patient reports [25], or human interaction [32] may be crucial for improving the
accuracy and reliability of HNC GTV segmentation.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our customized UMambaAdj model successfully combines the
strengths of long-range dependencies from UMamba blocks with the feature en-
coding capabilities of the nnU-Net Residual encoder, offering a balanced solution
for GTV segmentation in HNC. The model showed promise in achieving accu-
rate segmentations with a more efficient architecture, demonstrating compara-
ble or improved performance over existing methods. However, further validation
on diverse datasets and incorporating complementary tumor information with
human-in-the-loop strategies will be necessary to advance the application of au-
tomatic segmentation in clinical practice for MRI guided adaptive RT.
