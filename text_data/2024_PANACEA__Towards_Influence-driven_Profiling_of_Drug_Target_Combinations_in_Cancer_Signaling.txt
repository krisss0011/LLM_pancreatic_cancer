ABSTRACT
Data profiling has garnered increasing attention within the data
science community, primarily focusing on structured data. In this
paper, we introduce a novel framework called panacea, designed
to profile known cancer target combinations in cancer type-specific
signaling networks. Given a large signaling network for a cancer
type, known targets from approved anticancer drugs, a set of can-
cer mutated genes, and a combination size parameter 𝑘, panacea
automatically generates a delta histogram that depicts the distri-
bution of 𝑘-sized target combinations based on their topological
influence on cancer mutated genes and other nodes. To this end,
we formally define the novel problem of influence-driven target
combination profiling (𝑖-TCP) and propose an algorithm that em-
ploys two innovative personalized PageRank-based measures, PEN
distance and PEN-diff, to quantify this influence and generate the
delta histogram. Our experimental studies on signaling networks
related to four cancer types demonstrate that our proposed mea-
sures outperform several popular network properties in profiling
known target combinations. Notably, we demonstrate that panacea
can significantly reduce the candidate 𝑘-node combination explo-
ration space, addressing a longstanding challenge for tasks such
as in silico target combination prediction in large cancer-specific
signaling networks.

INTRODUCTION
“Improving the quality of target selection is widely con-
sidered as the single most important factor to improve
the productivity of the pharmaceutical industry.”
Csermely et al. [11]
Cell signaling is a complex network characterized by interactions
between various signaling pathways, making it essential to under-
stand signal flow, as disruptions can lead to numerous diseases [38].
For instance, mutations in genes encoding key signaling proteins
like RAS and PI3K are frequently associated with various cancers.
The approach to treating these altered signaling pathways has
long been dominated by the “one-target, one-drug” paradigm, which
focuses on finding a single chemical entity that interacts with a spe-
cific target. A target is an endogenous factor, typically an enzyme or
receptor, that affects the outcome of a disease or medical condition1.
However, most complex diseases are polygenic, involving a network
of interacting genes and their products rather than a single gene.
This realization has shifted attention towards combination therapy,
1In pathogen-related diseases, the target can sometimes be endogenous to the pathogen, instead of
the host. In this research, our focus is on non-pathogen-related diseases.

which aims to simultaneously target multiple molecules within a
disease-related signaling network [11, 14, 26, 38].
Combination therapy has the potential to provide greater bene-
fits than monotherapy by achieving comparable efficacy at lower
doses through synergistic effects, while also reducing the likelihood
of resistance developing [26]. Consequently, identifying effective
target combinations for specific diseases (a.k.a multi-target selec-
tion [14]) has become a recognized challenge in the field [11, 14, 26].
This has led to increasing research focused on developing in silico
techniques for predicting target combinations [3, 9, 10, 15, 20, 33,
34, 37]. However, existing studies face two significant limitations
(see Appendix A for details). First, they do not take into account
the characteristics (i.e., profiles) of approved target combinations
for specific diseases to guide discovery. Second, they are primarily
designed for small networks, as it is computationally intractable
to exhaustively explore the entire candidate combination space in
large networks. This paper presents a novel framework designed
to profile known target combinations in cancer signaling networks,
which has the potential to address these limitations.
1.1
Profiling Known Target Combinations
Data profiling is the set of activities and processes to determine the
metadata of a given dataset. In [19], it is defined as “Data profiling
is the process of examining the data available in an existing data
source [...] and collecting statistics and information about that data.”
It has been widely studied in the context of structured data [2]. The
type of data profiling we undertake is typically informed by the
downstream analysis we aim to conduct.
The Cancer Drugs Database, maintained by the Anticancer Fund [28],
offers a curated list of anticancer drugs approved by one or more
regulatory agencies (such as the FDA or NCI) for various cancer
types, along with their associated target combinations. In this pa-
per, we aim to profile these target combinations in the signaling
network of a specific cancer type. Instead of focusing on individual
targets, we profile known target combinations from approved drugs,
presenting a more accurate view of the topological features of can-
cer target combinations in large signaling networks. These profiles
potentially create opportunities for judiciously selecting candidate
combinations in a profile-driven manner. They can serve as a guide
for determining which candidate 𝑘-node combinations to further
analyze for target combination prediction (i.e., 𝑘molecules that
can be targeted simultaneously). For example, one might choose to
investigate network regions where most or very few known target
combinations are located.

Overview & Contributions
Profiling known target combinations in signaling networks presents
a significant challenge. Since various profiles can be generated, not

all are effective for characterizing these combinations to address
downstream problems such as target combination prediction. For
example, degree or PageRank distributions may fail to capture the
off-target effects of these combinations, which are a primary reason
for drug failures [36]. Therefore, it is crucial to select appropriate
features for profiling that can support the downstream analyses.
Additionally, to manage large and noisy cancer-specific signaling
networks, the chosen features must be purely topological. This
means they should not rely on complete mathematical models of
the underlying cancer network, nor on the pharmacological or
chemical properties of all involved molecules, or the genomic and
proteomic data of patients. Instead, the profiling strategy must
adopt a realistic perspective, acknowledging that such data is often
unavailable in many areas of cancer signaling networks.
In this paper, we introduce a novel influence-driven target combi-
nation profiling (𝑖-TCP) problem to tackle these challenges. Given a
large signaling network 𝐺𝐶for a cancer type 𝐶(e.g., breast, colorec-
tal), known targets tackled by anticancer drugs of 𝐶, a set of cancer
mutated genes (e.g., oncogenes) in 𝐺𝐶, and a combination size pa-
rameter 𝑘> 1, the goal of 𝑖-TCP is to generate a delta histogram
that depicts the distribution of 𝑘-size known target combinations in
𝐺𝐶based on their topological influence (i.e., strength of connection)
on cancer mutated genes and rest of the nodes in 𝐺𝐶.
We present a novel framework called panacea (Personalized
pAgerank-based profiliNg of cAnCEr tArgets) to address the 𝑖-TCP
problem (Figure 1). This framework utilizes a new personalized
PageRank-based (PPR) [40] measure called PEN distance to assess
the topological influence of one node (e.g., a drug target) on an-
other (e.g., an oncogene) in a cancer signaling network. Intuitively,
a smaller PEN distance suggests a greater influence due to a higher
number of paths between the node pair. Building on PEN distance,
we also propose a measure called PEN-diff, which captures the
difference in average influence of a 𝑘-node combination on a set
of cancer mutated genes compared to the remaining nodes in the
network. A positive PEN-diff value indicates that the average influ-
ence on the cancer mutated genes is greater than on other nodes,
effectively capturing the off-target effects of a drug from a topolog-
ical perspective (i.e., impact on rest of the nodes in 𝐺𝐶). Using the
PEN-diff values of 𝑘-node combinations and known target combi-
nations in 𝐶, we build a delta histogram to depict the distribution
of known 𝑘-target combinations in the PEN-diff space of 𝐺𝐶. Our
experimental results highlight the advantages of PEN-diff-based
profiling (i.e., influence-driven profiling) of known target combina-
tions compared to several other popular topological measures (e.g.,
PageRank, network distance).
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions.
• We present a novel problem termed influence-driven target
combination profiling to analyze known target combinations
in cancer signaling networks, introducing the framework
called panacea to tackle this issue. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the first effort to specifically profile known target
combinations in a disease-related signaling network, bridg-
ing the topics of data profiling and combination therapy.
• We introduce a new PPR-based measure, PEN-diff, designed
to capture the differences in influence of 𝑘-target combina-
tions on cancer genes compared to other nodes in a cancer
signaling network. While PPR computation methods have
been extensively studied for their efficiency and scalability,
they have not been applied to profiling target combinations.
• We experimentally demonstrate that panacea outperforms
two baseline strategies in profiling target combinations across
four different cancer types.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
present relevant background information. We formally introduce
the 𝑖-TCP problem in Section 3. We present the panacea framework
to address it in Section 4. The performance of panacea is reported
in Section 5. We discuss related work in Section 6. The last section
concludes the paper.

BACKGROUND
In this section, we begin by introducing the network representation
of human signaling. Then, we introduce the databases of cancer
mutated genes and drug targets that we leverage. Finally, we briefly
describe the notion of personalized PageRank.
2.1
Human Signaling Network
Cell signaling refers to the process of cellular communication by
which proteins and other factors interact to perform multifaceted
information processing functions, such as growth, survival, and
differentiation. These cell signalings usually occur through different
signaling pathways. The interconnections between these signaling
pathways are crucial to understand the flow of signaling events as

gene mutations or epigenetic changes can alter the cellular signaling
events leading to various diseases such as cancer.
A biological signaling network describes the interactions be-
tween molecular species (or molecules) in cell signaling. Each in-
teraction takes the form of a biochemical reaction. Large signaling
networks often are modeled simply as large graphs. For instance,
Cui et al. [13] modeled the human signaling network as a graph
where nodes represent proteins. Directed links are used to represent
activation or inhibition whereas undirected links represent physical
interactions of proteins that are not characterized as activating or
inhibitory. There are two types of directed links, incoming and
outgoing. The incoming link represents a signaling from another
node whereas an outgoing link represents a signal to another node.
These two types of directed links are collectively referred to as
signal links. In contrast, the physical links are referred to as neutral
links. In this paper, we represent the human signaling network
using this model.
In our work, we utilize the signaling network used in the study
reported in [41]. Specifically, Zaman et al. [41] collected and curated
this network based on the previous studies [4, 13, 22]. It contains
6, 305 nodes and 62, 937 links. There are 33, 398 activation links
(i.e., positive links), 7, 960 inhibitory links (i.e., negative links), and
21, 579 physical links (neutral links). Since we focus on signal links,
we reduce this network by removing all neutral links. Table 1 sum-
marizes the features of the reduced network that we shall be using
in the sequel. Figure 2 shows a fragment of the reduced network.
2.2
Cancer Mutated Genes
Genes that, when mutated, result in tumorigenesis often lead to the
aberrant activation of certain downstream signaling nodes giving
rise to dysregulated growth, survival and/or differentiation. We
gather cancer mutated genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Cen-
sus database [31]. These genes can be categorized into three types,
positive regulators (oncogenes), negative regulators (tumor sup-
pressors), and fusion genes. Since majority of the mutated genes in
cancer are oncogenes [13], we focus only on them in this work. In
our dataset, there are 318 oncogenes, 252 (79.25%) of which can be
located in the constructed human signaling network. Some example
cancer genes are shown in Figure 2.
2.3
Cancer Drug Targets
A disease node in a signaling network is a molecule that is either
involved in some dysregulated biological processes implicated in a
disease (e.g., cancer), or is of interest due to its potential role (e.g.,
oncogene) in the disease. Targeted therapy is the foundation of
precision medicine, which is a type of cancer treatment that targets
specific nodes (i.e., drug targets) that can modulate these disease
nodes in order to control the survival, division, and spread of cancer
cells. For example, a disease node in the MAPK signaling network is

reduced human signaling network. The red edges are positive
links and the blue edges are negative links. Nodes in yellow

phosphorylated ERK (ERKPP). Hence, drug targets are those nodes
(e.g., proteins) that can reduce the activity of ERKPP in order to
curb the proliferative potential of cancer cells.
We obtain data on cancer drug targets from the Cancer Drugs
Database maintained by Anticancer Fund [28]. This database pro-
vides a curated list of anticancer drugs approved by one or more reg-
ulatory agencies (e.g., FDA or NCI) as well as their targets. Among
the list of 1, 025 drug targets, 119 (11.61%) are oncogenes and 725
(70.73%) are in the human signaling network [28]. Some example
drug targets are depicted in Figure 2.
2.4
Personalized PageRank (PPR)
Intuitively, the personalized PageRank (PPR) [40] is a classic metric
that measures the proximity of nodes in a graph based on how
well they are connected to each other via random walks. That is,
PPR of a node 𝑡in a directed graph reflects its relevance from the
perspective of a source node 𝑠. Formally, let𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) be a directed
graph where 𝑉is the set of nodes (vertices) and 𝐸is the set of edges
(links). Given a source node 𝑠∈𝑉and a jump factor 𝛼, a walker
starts from 𝑠to traverse 𝐺, and at each step, the walker either (a)
terminates at the current node with a probability 𝛼, or (b) jumps to
a randomly selected out-neighbor of the current node. For any node
𝑡∈𝑉, the personalized PageRank (PPR) 𝜋(𝑠,𝑡) is the probability
that a random walk (RW) from 𝑠terminates at 𝑡. Intuitively, a large
𝜋(𝑠,𝑡) indicates that many paths exist from 𝑠to 𝑡. That is, 𝑠is well
connected to 𝑡. The 𝛼value is usually set to 0.15 or 0.2 [40, 42].

THE 𝑖-TCP PROBLEM
In this section, we formally define the influence-driven target com-
bination profiling (𝑖-TCP) problem that we address in this paper.
Intuitively, the goal of the 𝑖-TCP problem is to generate a delta his-
togram that visually represents the distribution of known 𝑘-target
combinations w.r.t. their topological influence in a cancer signaling
network. Given a large signaling network 𝐺𝐶= (𝑉𝐶, 𝐸𝐶) for a can-
cer type 𝐶(e.g., breast, colorectal), known targets 𝑋𝑡⊆𝑉𝐶of 𝐶, a
set of cancer mutated genes 𝑋𝑔⊆𝑉𝐶in 𝐺𝐶, and a 𝑘-combination
node setℎ𝑘where𝑘> 1 andℎ𝑘⊂𝑉𝐶, the topological influence ofℎ𝑘

is defined by a function 𝑓(ℎ𝑘,𝑋𝑔,𝐺𝐶) that quantifies the aggregate
influence of ℎ𝑘on 𝑋𝑔and (𝑉𝐶−𝑋𝑔).
A delta histogram H𝐶of 𝐺𝐶is an equi-width histogram whose
𝑋-axis represents 𝑁𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡buckets and the 𝑌-axis represents the
percentages of known 𝑘-target combinations in 𝐺𝐶in each bucket.
A 𝑘-node combination ℎ𝑘is assigned to a bucket 𝑏𝑖= [𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥]
if 𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛< 𝑓(ℎ𝑘,𝑋𝑔,𝐺𝐶) ≤𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥. The percentage of known 𝑘-target
combinations in 𝑏𝑖is the number of known target combinations in
the top-𝑚percentage of 𝑘-node combinations for 𝑚> 0.
Definition 3.1. Given a signaling network 𝐺𝐶= (𝑉𝐶, 𝐸𝐶) for a
cancer type 𝐶, a set of known targets 𝑋𝑡⊆𝑉𝐶, a set of cancer-
mutated genes 𝑋𝑔⊆𝑉𝐶, a combination size parameter 𝑘> 1, and
the number of buckets 𝑁𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡> 1, the goal of influence-driven
target combination profiling problem is to compute the following:
H𝑘,𝑁𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡= F (G(𝐺𝐶,𝑘,𝑋𝑔),𝑋𝑡, 𝑁𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡)
(1)
where G(𝐺𝐶,𝑘,𝑋𝑔) is a function that computes 𝑓(ℎ𝑘,𝑋𝑔,𝐺𝐶) of the
𝑘-combination nodes in 𝐺𝐶and F (·) is a function that computes an
𝑁𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡-delta histogram of the known 𝑘-target combinations in 𝑋𝑡.
In panacea the topological influence function 𝑓(·) is realized
by a novel PPR-based measure called PEN-Diff that captures the
interplay between the influence of a 𝑘-target combinations on 𝑋𝑔
and rest of the network (i.e., off-target effect).
4
THE PANACEA FRAMEWORK
In this section, we present the panacea framework to address
the 𝑖-TCP problem in a cancer signaling network. We begin by
introducing a PPR-based node distance measure called PEN distance
that serves as the foundation for this task.
4.1
PEN Distance
Recall that the key goal of our work is to characterize the topological
influence (i.e., strength of connection) between drug target combi-
nations and cancer genes, as well as other nodes within a cancer
signaling network. While several studies in drug and target com-
bination discovery utilize various distance-based measures [8, 15],
it is important to recognize that the shortest path is not the only
way a target can impact other nodes. Targets may connect to other
nodes via multiple alternative paths. Therefore, assessing topologi-
cal influence should leverage network propagation-based methods.
Cowen et al. [12] have reviewed several of these methods, which
include PPR, RW, and diffusion kernels. In our work, we focus on
capturing connectivity-based relationships through a PPR-based
distance measure known as PEN distance (Personalized pagErank-
based Node distance). It is worth noting that RW and diffusion
kernels are unsuitable for calculating PEN distance between node
pairs. In particular, the diffusion kernel serves as the continuous-
time equivalent of random walks with restart [12].
Intuitively, the PPR value 𝜋(𝑠,𝑡) indicates the node 𝑡’s impor-
tance to the node 𝑠. Recall that if 𝜋(𝑠,𝑡) is high then 𝑡can be
reached from 𝑠via many paths (i.e., 𝑡is important w.r.t. 𝑠as it can
be reached by many paths from 𝑠). Our goal is to capture this im-
portance between a pair of nodes (e.g., a drug target FGFR2 and a
tumor suppressor TP53 in Figure 2) in a cancer signaling network
in the form of a “distance” measure. That is, if a node pair (𝑠,𝑡)
has a high PPR value then the “distance” should be small. Unfor-
tunately, the PPR values of adjacent node pairs in a graph could
vary significantly [42]. Consequently, directly using the PPR values
as a “distance” measure may inject a large variance in their values
between the adjacent nodes (e.g., adjacent drug targets) and other
nodes (e.g., oncogenes). To alleviate this challenge, we propose PEN
distance as follows.
Definition 4.1. [PEN Distance] Given a signaling network 𝐺=
(𝑉, 𝐸), the PEN distance between nodes 𝑠∈𝑉and 𝑡∈𝑉is defined as
follows:
𝑃[𝑠,𝑡] =
(0
if 𝑠= 𝑡,
1 −log(𝜋𝑑(𝑠,𝑡) + 𝜖)
if 𝑠≠𝑡.
(2)
where 𝑠≠𝑡, 𝜋d(𝑠,𝑡) = 𝜋(𝑠,𝑡) × 𝑑(𝑠), 𝑑(𝑠) is the out-degree of node
𝑠, and 𝜖= 1𝑒−5 where 𝑒is the Euler constant.
In the above definition, 𝜋𝑑(𝑠,𝑡) is the degree-normalized PPR
(DPPR) from 𝑠to 𝑡. According to [39], multiplying a node’s PPR
by its out-degree yields a more precise measure of the strength of

connections between nodes. Additionally, employing DPPR helps
mitigate the variability of PPR among neighboring nodes. The 𝜖
parameter is added to avoid undefined 𝑙𝑜𝑔(·) value when 𝜋(𝑠,𝑡) = 0.
Intuitively, if 𝜋(𝑠,𝑡) is large, then 𝑃[𝑠,𝑡] tends to be small, i.e., well-
connected nodes have a closer distance from each other.
Example 4.2. Figure 3 illustrates the distributions of PEN distance
and PPR values for signaling networks in four cancer types (𝛼= 0.2).
Notably, the PEN distance distribution maintains a consistent shape
across all cancer types, while the PPR value distribution shows
significant variation among them. As we shall discuss later, the
stable shape and range of the PEN distance distribution aid in
profiling drug targets across various cancer types.
4.2
PEN-Diff
Next, we introduce the notion of PEN-diff, which is based on PEN
distance. Let 𝑉𝑔⊂𝑉𝐶be a set of nodes in a signaling network 𝐺𝐶.
Consider a node 𝑠∈𝑉𝐶. The average PEN distance from 𝑠to 𝑉𝑔,
denoted as 𝑃[𝑠,𝑉𝑔], is given as follows.
𝑃[𝑠,𝑉𝑔] =
Í|𝑉𝑔|
𝑖=1 𝑃[𝑠,𝑡𝑖]
|𝑉𝑔|
(3)
Then, the single-source PEN-diff of a node 𝑠in 𝐺𝐶= (𝑉𝐶, 𝐸𝐶),
denoted as 𝑃Δ[𝑠,𝑉𝑔], is the difference between the average PEN
distance to the the nodes in 𝑉𝐶−𝑉𝑔and the average PEN distance
to the nodes in 𝑉𝑔. Formally, it is defined as follows.
𝑃Δ[𝑠,𝑉𝑔] = 𝑃[𝑠,𝑉𝐶−𝑉𝑔] −𝑃[𝑠,𝑉𝑔]
(4)
Given two sets of nodes 𝑉𝑠and 𝑉𝑔, the PEN-diff of 𝑉𝑠is the average
single-source PEN-diff values of the nodes in 𝑉𝑠w.r.t. 𝑉𝑔and rest
of the nodes in the network. Formally,
Definition 4.3. [PEN-diff] Given 𝑉𝑠⊂𝑉𝐶and 𝑉𝑔⊂𝑉𝐶in a
signaling network 𝐺𝐶= (𝑉𝐶, 𝐸𝐶), the PEN-diff of 𝑉𝑠is defined as
follows.
𝑃Δ[𝑉𝑠,𝑉𝑔] =
Í|𝑉𝑠|
𝑖=1 𝑃Δ[𝑣𝑖,𝑉𝑔]
|𝑉𝑠|
(5)
Remark. Observe that if 𝑃Δ[𝑉𝑠,𝑉𝑔] > 0 then the average PEN
distance of nodes in 𝑉𝑠and (𝑉𝐶−𝑉𝑔) is larger than the average

PEN distance with 𝑉𝑔. That is, the nodes in 𝑉𝑠are relatively less
connected to the nodes in (𝑉𝐶−𝑉𝑔) compared to the nodes in
𝑉𝑔. In the next subsection, we shall represent a set of oncogenes
using𝑉𝑔and target combinations using𝑉𝑠. Consequently, a positive
PEN-diff value for a target combination set indicates that these
targets exert relatively less influence on the rest of the network
compared to the oncogenes, which is desirable due to off-target
effects. Also, note that although in this paper we use𝑉𝑔to represent
oncogenes, panacea is flexible to represent other types of nodes
(e.g., biomarkers, disease-related nodes) as 𝑉𝑔. The framework can
be easily applied to all such variations of 𝑉𝑔.
4.3
Profiling Drug Target Combinations
We now present the algorithm to profile the known target combi-
nations in a cancer signaling network by exploiting PEN distance.
It is composed of the following four phases.
Phase 1: Target-aware cancer-specific signaling network con-
struction. Given that cancer is a complex disease involving differ-
ent genes and proteins for various types (e.g., breast, colorectal) and
that drug targets differ by cancer type, we first extract a subnetwork
from the reduced human signaling network (Table 1) corresponding
to a specific cancer type 𝐶and the known targets for 𝐶(Section 2.3).
Algorithm 1 outlines the procedure. Given the reduced signaling
network 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸), a cancer type 𝐶, a set of known targets 𝑋𝑡for
𝐶from the Anticancer Fund database [28], a set of oncogenes 𝑋𝑔
from COSMIC Cancer Gene Census database [31], and a configurable
path length threshold 𝑑(𝑑= 5 by default), the algorithm searches
for paths with length less than 𝑑between each pair of a known
target 𝑢∈𝑋𝑡and an oncogene 𝑣∈𝑋𝑔in 𝐺. The nodes in each
such path 𝑝(𝑢, 𝑣) and their edges are added to a path set 𝑃𝐶and
then used to extract the output subnetwork 𝐺𝐶from 𝐺. That is, the
subnetwork encompasses all nodes associated with the oncogenes
and targets for 𝐶, along with the intermediate nodes that link them.
Example 4.4. Consider the reduced human signaling network
in Figure 2. Assume that we are interested in breast cancer. Then
the target-aware, cancer-specific signaling network constructed
by Algorithm 1 is depicted in Figure 4 (partial view). The color
coded nodes depict the oncogenes and targets relevant to breast

cancer. Table 2 reports the features of target-aware, cancer-specific
signaling networks for four different cancer types.
Phase 2: PEN distance computation. Given the constructed
target-aware cancer-specific signaling network 𝐺𝐶, this phase com-
putes the PEN distance between all pairs of nodes in the network
by exploiting Definition 4.1. The key step here is the computation
of PPR values of pairs of nodes. Since this phase incurs a one-time
cost for a specific signaling network, we calculate the exact PPR
values. It produces the PEN distance matrix P, which contains the
PEN distance values for all pairs of nodes in 𝐺𝐶.
Example 4.5. Consider the target-aware, breast cancer-specific
signaling network in Figure 4. The PEN distance matrix involving
some of the node pairs is shown Table 3. Observe that there are
multiple paths from various nodes to PIK3CA, resulting in low PEN
distance between these pairs. In contrast, TP53AIP1 and the other
nodes exhibit high distance, as there are very few (if any) paths
linking them to TP53AIP1.
Phase 3: PEN-diff computation phase In this phase, we uti-
lize the PEN distance matrix P to compute the PEN Diff (Defini-
tion 4.3) for 𝑘-node combinations in 𝐺𝑐w.r.t. the oncogenes and
non-oncogenes. Algorithm 2 outlines the procedure. Consider the
set of oncogenes𝑋𝑔in𝐺𝑐and a combination size parameter 𝑘(𝑘> 1).
For each 𝑘-nodes pair of 𝑉𝑐, denoted as 𝐻𝑘,𝑖, we compute the aver-
age PEN-distance of the nodes in 𝐻𝑘,𝑖with the nodes in 𝑋𝑔(Line 3).
Similarly, we calculate the average PEN-distance with the nodes in
𝑉𝐶−𝑋𝑔(Line 4). Finally, the difference between these two values
is used to compute the PEN-diff of 𝐻𝑘,𝑖, which is then stored in the
PEN-diff hash table 𝐷(Line 5).
Example 4.6. The PEN-diff values of two 2-node combinations
in Figure 4 are shown in Table 4. Notably, the PEN-diff values are
positive. The nodes FGFR2 and PIK3CA are both targets of the
drug Fulvestrant, a hormone treatment for advanced breast cancer.
This pair has an average PEN distance of 2.4313 with oncogenes
and 3.1732 with other nodes, indicating that they are, on average,
significantly more connected to oncogenes than to the rest of the
network. In contrast, the nodes FGFR2 and TP53AIP1 are not targets
of the same drug (i.e., not a target combination), resulting in a

Phase 4: Target combination profiling. The PEN-diff hash table
𝐷generated in the preceding phase is exploited in this phase to
profile known target combinations in 𝐺𝐶. Algorithm 3 outlines the
procedure. Given 𝐷, a set of known targets 𝑋𝑡for the cancer 𝐶,
and the number of buckets 𝑁𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡, it first groups the 𝑘-node com-
binations in 𝐷according to their PEN-diff values (Line 5). Recall
that 𝐷contains the mapping between a 𝑘-node combination and
its PEN-diff value. Specifically, the groupBy procedure generates
equi-width 𝑁𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡(by default 𝑁𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡= 5) buckets based on the

PEN-diff values and assigns each combination in 𝐷to the appro-
priate bucket 𝑏𝑖= [𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥]. That is, a node combination 𝑐is
assigned to a bucket 𝑏𝑖if 𝐷[𝑐] > 𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛and 𝐷[𝑐] ≤𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥. Node com-
binations within each bucket are sorted by their PEN-diff values
in descending order (i.e., a lower rank indicates greater similarity
in average connectivity or influence between 𝑉𝑔and rest of the
nodes). The known target combinations in 𝐷, denoted as 𝐾, are
extracted from 𝐹(Line 6). Then the percentage of known 𝑘-target
combinations in a specific bucket is computed by counting the
number of known target combinations in the top-𝑚percentage of
node combinations by varying 𝑚∈1, 10, 20, 50 (Line 7-9). This is
used to construct the delta-histogram (Line 10). The 𝑋-axis of the
delta histogram represents the buckets, while the 𝑌-axis indicates
the percentages of known 𝑘-target combinations in each bucket for
different values of 𝑚. The [𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥] values of the bucket with
the highest coverage are returned as the target profile thresholds
𝛿𝑚𝑖𝑛and 𝛿𝑚𝑎𝑥(ties are broken arbitrarily). We define the cover-
age of a bucket as the percentage of known target combinations
in the top-50% of its node combinations. These values for a spe-
cific cancer-type network and the delta histogram can be used to
prioritize 𝑘-target combinations. It is important to note that we
emphasize the percentage of known target combinations among all
known target combinations in a bucket, rather than among all node
combinations, since the size of the latter can vary across different
cancer types and buckets.

majority of the known targets are found in the first bucket. Specif-
ically, the bucket [−0.0045, 0.4301] has the highest coverage of
known target combinations for all values of 𝑚. Hence, these val-
ues are returned as 𝛿𝑚𝑖𝑛and 𝛿𝑚𝑎𝑥, respectively, along with the
delta histogram. Additionally, most known target combinations fall
within the top 1% of the first bucket, and for the remaining𝑚values,
there are no known target combinations beyond those in the top
1%. As a result, the bars in the first bucket are of equal length.
4.4
An Application of Delta Histograms
The delta histograms characterize the influence of known target
combinations on oncogenes in comparison to rest of the nodes in a
signaling network. This information is valuable for various down-
stream applications, including the discovery of novel target combi-
nations. In this subsection, we will provide an intuitive overview
of how delta histograms can be used to efficiently predict novel
target combinations in a large cancer signaling network.
First, for a given cancer type, we choose the target pruning
threshold and range constraint based on the delta histogram. Specif-
ically, we can observe the distribution of the known target combi-
nations and select appropriate bucket(s) for further analysis. Then
we select all 𝑘-node combinations whose PEN-diff values satisfy
the range constraint and rank them accordingly. Users can then
select the top-𝑚candidates based on their requirements. This prior-
itized list of target combination candidates can be further examined
using a multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm to predict
novel target combinations. As we shall see in the next section, this
delta histogram-guided approach can significantly reduce the size
of the candidate node combination space for MOO compared to
other network property-based methods. This, in turn, enables the
development of target combination prediction techniques that are
well-suited for large, noisy signaling networks.
Example 4.8. Consider the delta histogram of breast cancer in Ex-
ample 4.7. Given that the first bucket [−0.0045, 0.4301] has the high-
est coverage, one may use the range constraint 𝑃Δ[𝑉𝑠,𝑉𝑔] ≤0.4301
to prioritize candidates for target combination discovery. Alterna-
tively, one can examine one or more buckets with fewer known
target combinations but higher PEN-diff values to identify potential
novel candidates. The delta histogram provides the flexibility to
choose bucket(s) based on specific objectives related to target com-
bination discovery. Section 5.4 presents a case study to demonstrate
the benefits of delta histograms.

PERFORMANCE STUDY
panacea is implemented using Python. We shall now present the
key performance results of panacea. All experiments are performed
on a 64-bit Windows machine with 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM)
i7-1250U CPU(1.10 GHz) and 32.0 GB of main memory.
5.1
Experimental Setup
Datasets. We use the four types of cancer signaling networks in
Table 2. We use the sets of oncogenes and known targets as detailed
in Section 2. We set 𝛼= 0.2, 𝑘= 2, and 𝑁𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡= 5 for our
experiments. Specifically, we set 𝑘= 2 because most literature on in
silico target combination discovery primarily focuses on identifying
2 or 3 target combinations for combination therapy [10, 15, 34]. We
set 𝑁𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡= 5 as it gives a good balance between the number of
buckets and the distribution of known target combinations among
them. We set 𝑚∈{10, 20, 40, 50}.
Baselines. We compare panacea with the following baselines.
• PPR-diff: Recall that a key motivation for introducing PEN
distance is that we cannot effectively use PPR to profile
known target combinations. Therefore, in this baseline, we
use PPR (Section 2.4) values of the node pairs in 𝐺𝐶to cal-
culate the average difference instead of PEN-diff.
• Distance-diff: We leverage network distance between a pair
of nodes 𝑠and 𝑡in 𝐺𝐶(i.e., the length of the shortest path
from 𝑠to 𝑡) in lieu of PEN distance to compute the average
difference. Note that distance has been exploited by several
recent techniques for target/drug combination discovery [8,
15]. Additionally, it serves as the basis for various network
centrality measures, including betweenness and closeness
centrality.
Note that we do not consider PDistance [42] as a baseline as it is
designed specifically for positioning nodes for network visualiza-
tion.
The computation of PPR-diff and Distance-diff is similar to PEN-
diff. Given a signaling network 𝐺𝐶, for a 𝑘-node combination, we
compute the average PPR (resp. distance) to the set to oncogenes
𝑉𝑔and rest of the nodes 𝑉𝐶−𝑉𝑔in the cancer-specific signaling
network. We then find the difference to determine the PPR-diff
(resp. Distance-diff ).

Delta Histograms
We first report the delta histograms generated by panacea and
their characteristics. Figure 5 plots the results. We can make the fol-
lowing observations. Firstly, the buckets with the highest coverage
vary across different cancers. Specifically, for breast and colorec-
tal cancers, the first bucket shows the maximum coverage, while
for bladder and prostate cancers, the buckets [2.0884, 2.6112] and
[0.1432 −0.4712] have the highest coverage, respectively. This
variation is expected given the complexity and heterogeneity of
different cancer types. Note that these buckets include 55.28%-100%
of the known target combinations. Specifically, the buckets with
the highest coverage encompass the majority of known target com-
binations for breast, bladder, and colorectal cancers. Secondly, a
significant portion of the known target combinations (with some
exceptions for breast cancer) exhibit positive PEN-diff values. This
suggests that these known target combinations are more closely
connected to the oncogenes than to the other nodes, indicating they
exert greater topological influence on the oncogenes compared to
the rest. Thirdly, the known target combinations are not always
grouped in buckets with high PEN-diff values (i.e., the rightmost
buckets) for every cancer type. This creates an opportunity to in-
vestigate candidate combinations in buckets with elevated PEN-diff
values for the discovery of novel target combinations.

Comparison of Exploration Space Size
We hypothesize that the size of delta histogram-guided exploration
space is significantly smaller and amenable for downstream analysis.
In this set of experiments, we analyze the size of this exploration
space and compare it to those generated by the baseline strategies.
Size of the maximum-coverage bucket. We consider the buckets
that have maximum (i.e., highest) coverage of known target com-
binations for the four types of cancer. Table 5 reports the number
of candidate 𝑘-size combination in the cancer-specific signaling
network, along with the range constraints (recall from Section 4.4)
for the buckets with maximum coverage, their size |𝑏| (i.e., num-
ber of 𝑘-node combinations), and the coverage of known target
combinations. We note that each cancer-specific signaling network
contains over two million candidate target combinations, making
exhaustive exploration of this space for potential target combina-
tions computationally challenging. However, if one opts to explore
the bucket with maximum coverage, the exploration space is dra-
matically reduced by 99.95%, 99.92%, 99.997% and 69.73% for breast

cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer, re-
spectively. For instance, if one chooses the bucket [−0.0045, 0.4301]
for further analysis in the breast cancer-specific signaling network,
they only need to examine 1, 770 out of a total of 3, 275, 520 candi-
date combinations in the network. This significantly reduces the
exploration space and has the potential to enhance the efficiency
of downstream tasks.
Comparison of worst-case bucket size. The experiment above
highlights the benefit of exploring buckets with maximum coverage.
Note that one may choose to analyze other buckets as well. Hence,
a key question arises: What is the worst-case size of a bucket in
the delta histogram that one may need to explore, and how does it
compare to the buckets generated by PPR-diff and Distance-diff? In
this set of experiments, we shed insights into this question.
We compare the worst-case size of a bucket in the delta his-
tograms of panacea with the corresponding worst-case bucket
sizes in the delta histograms generated by PPR-diff and Distance-
diff, respectively. To this end, we define exploration size ratio (ESR)
as follows.
𝐸𝑆𝑅𝑋= |𝑏𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡,𝑋|
|𝑏𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡,𝑃|
(6)
In the above equation,𝑋∈{𝑃𝑃𝑅−𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓, 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒−𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓, panacea},
𝑃denotes panacea, and 𝑏𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡,𝑀is the bucket with the largest
number of 𝑘-node combinations in the delta histogram generated
by 𝑀. Note that 𝐸𝑆𝑅panacea = 1. The results are shown in Table 6.
Observe that 𝐸𝑆𝑅consistently exceeds 1 across all cancer types for
both PPR-diff and Distance-diff. This indicates that, in the worst
case, significantly larger candidate combinations must be explored
when the delta histograms are generated using network distance
or PPR. This occurs because the PPR-diff and Distance-diff values
for most candidate combinations are clustered within a narrow
range. Figures 6, 7, and 8 plot the distributions of PEN-diff, PPR-
diff, and Distance-diff values for breast and colorectal cancer. We
notice that the distributions of PPR-diff and Distance-diff have a
narrower width compared to PEN-diff. Figure 9 depicts the delta
histograms generated by Dist-diff and PPR-diff for breast cancer. It
is evident that the coverage of the maximum-coverage buckets is
lower compared to panacea. The results are qualitatively similar for
other cancer types, indicating that these baselines are not effective
for profiling known target combinations.
5.4
Can Delta Histograms Aid In-Silico Target
Combination Prediction?
In this section, we undertake a case study to demonstrate the ben-
efits of delta histograms generated by panacea for reducing the
exploration space for in-silico target combination prediction.
We use the results of Hu et al. [15] for identifying synergistic opti-
mal control nodes (OCN) pairs in breast cancer. The result set is avail-
able at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6522545/
bin/41467_2019_10215_MOESM8_ESM.xlsx. Note that it identifies
63 synergistic OCN pairs as candidates for combination therapy.
These pairs involve 28 genes. In our breast cancer signaling net-
work, three of these genes–PSENEN, MAML2, and GNG11–are
missing. As a result, we pruned the OCN pairs involving these
genes, leading to 35 synergistic OCN pairs. We found that all these
OCN pairs are confined to just two buckets in the delta histogram
for breast cancer, rather than being spread across all five buckets:
[0.8647 −1.2993] and [1.2993 −1.7338] (Figure 5). Specifically, the
PEN-diff values for these OCN pairs fall within [1.1446 −1.6398].
Therefore, exploring these two buckets instead of the entire breast
cancer signaling network can significantly aid in the discovery of
all these OCN pairs. Furthermore, it is important to note that the
PEN-diff values of all these OCN pairs are greater than one. This
indicates that these OCN pairs exert relatively less influence on
the rest of the network compared to the oncogenes (i.e., off-target
effects), which is a desirable characteristic, as mentioned earlier.
Thus, our proposed PEN-diff-based model aligns with the synergistic
OCN pairs identified by Hu et al. Additionally, exploring these two
buckets for target combination prediction may uncover novel target
pairs with positive PEN-diff values that were not identified by Hu
et al.
5.5
Impact of Noise
Large signaling networks are inherently noisy, and certain areas
may lack accurate edge information related to cell signaling. In this
experiment, we examine how noise affects delta histograms across
various cancer types. Specifically, we randomly add or remove 1-
5% of the edges in a cancer-specific signaling network and then
generate the delta histograms. We present the results for breast and
prostate cancer, noting that prostate cancer is the most difficult to
profile, with a maximum coverage of 55.28% (Table 5).
Figures 10 and 11 plot the results for breast cancer. Notably, the
shapes of the delta histograms closely resemble those of the original
network (Figure 5) with only the [𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥] values of the buckets
changing. Figures 12 and 13 plot the results for prostate cancer.
Unlike breast cancer, the shape of the delta histograms for prostate
cancer is affected by noise. While the shapes remain similar with a
1% addition or removal of edges, they change with a 5% modification,
leading to the emergence of an additional bucket. Importantly, in all
cases, there is a dominant bucket with high coverage. In summary, the
shape of the delta histogram varies by cancer type, with some being
influenced by the noise in the underlying signaling network, which
is expected due to the complexity and heterogeneity of cancer.

RELATED WORK
Significant research has been dedicated to data profiling [2], with
a primary emphasis on creating various techniques to efficiently
uncover statistics and metadata (e.g., dependencies, correlations)
from data, which can be applied to areas like data cleaning and query
optimization. When it comes to network data, profiling efforts have
mainly concentrated on analyzing the distributions of metrics such
as degree, path length, and different centrality measures, along with
summarizing graph structures [5, 25]. To the best of our knowledge,
none of these studies have specifically addressed the profiling of
disease-related signaling networks.
There is extensive research on efficient computation of PPR with
quality guarantees [40]. In this context, we investigate how two
PPR-based measures, PEN distance and PEN-diff, can be utilized to
profile known target combinations in cancer signaling networks.
Zhang et al. [42] introduced a PPR-based distance measure called
PDistance, designed to enhance graph visualization by strategically
positioning nodes. While PEN distance also uses degree-normalized
PPR, it has a different definition and application than PDistance.

PPR has also been used for analyzing protein-protein interaction

Techniques such as random walks, random walks with restart
(e.g., PPR), and diffusion kernels have been used for network prop-
agation aimed at tasks like function prediction, gene prioritization,
module detection, patient stratification [12]. However, these meth-
ods typically yield scoring vectors or similarity matrices rather than
delta histograms, and they do not focus on profiling known target
combinations. More recently, Pak et al. [27] developed NetGP to
predict drug responses by using drug target information to compute
gene perturbation scores through network perturbation methods.

cally using a distance-based separation measure to assess the prox-
imity of targets. In contrast, our approach employs PEN distance to

examine the relationships between a set of drug targets, oncogenes,
and the remaining nodes in the network.
Ulgen et al. [35] developed a framework for personalized drug
prioritization in PPI networks using random walk with restart. How-
ever, their approach differs from ours in several significant ways.
Firstly, it does not focus on profiling known drug target combina-
tions, which is a unique aspect of our study; instead, it prioritizes
drugs. Secondly, like many existing methods, it relies on “shortest
distance” (network distance) instead of PEN distance. Thirdly, they
use PPI networks rather than signaling networks. Finally, the algo-
rithms differ primarily because they address a different problem
than we do.
Lastly, there is a growing body of research aimed at discovering
synergistic target combinations in silico [9, 10, 15, 33]. However,
these methods struggle to scale to signaling networks with thou-
sands of nodes. There is also considerable research in synergistic
drug combination prediction using various drug features and/or
cell line features [6, 8, 18, 21, 30, 32]. As noted in Section 1, our ap-
proach, panacea, complements these efforts by generating a delta
histogram that can help guide the selection of candidate 𝑘-node
combinations in a cancer signaling network.

CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK
This paper integrates data profiling with cancer signaling networks
and drug targets by introducing the novel influence-driven target
combination profiling problem and presenting panacea as a solu-
tion for large cancer signaling networks. It utilizes two innovative
personalized PageRank-based measures, PEN distance and PEN-
diff, to summarize the distribution of known targets in relation to
their influence on cancer-mutated genes and other nodes in the net-
work through delta histograms. Experimental results show that the
PEN-diff-based profiling outperforms several alternative methods.
This paper represents the first attempt to profile known target
combinations in disease-related signaling networks using Person-
alized PageRank (PPR), opening up several intriguing challenges.
The size of the exploration space in large cancer-specific signaling
networks has been a longstanding challenge, which has limited
existing target (or drug) combination techniques. These methods
often overlook the topological profiles of known combinations and
must operate on small signaling networks or subgraphs. Delta his-
tograms could help guide and narrow the exploration space for
these tasks, making the design of delta histogram-guided target
combination prediction solutions a crucial area for future research.
Additionally, a key aspect of panacea is that it does not rely
on complete signaling network models or specific genomic and
proteomic information, instead adopting a topological approach
based on the assumption that large signaling networks often lack
comprehensive mathematical models and patient data. When partial
data is available for certain regions of the network, it presents an
interesting challenge to profile known targets by exploiting them.
Last but not least, the concept of delta histogram-based profil-
ing of cancer signaling networks can be applied to other “network
diseases” (e.g., diabetes). This approach allows us to characterize ap-
proved target combinations associated with these diseases and lever-
age them for predicting new target combinations. Consequently,
this work opens up a novel avenue for addressing the multi-target
selection problem in various complex diseases.

A
TARGET COMBINATION DISCOVERY IN
DRUG DISCOVERY PIPELINE
The target-based drug discovery pipeline for combination therapy
consists of three key steps: the discovery phase, the preclinical phase,
and the clinical phase. In the discovery phase, potential targets are
identified, screened, and validated, followed by the identification
and optimization of lead compounds for these targets. During the
preclinical phase, these optimized compounds are tested in animal
models to assess their efficacy and safety before moving on to
human trials in the clinical phase. This pipeline typically spans
12–15 years and costs as much as 1 billion USD to bring a single
drug to market [11].
Unfortunately, the drug discovery pipeline has not yielded many
successful new drugs. A significant issue is that novel targets identi-
fied in the discovery phase tend to have a low success rate [29]. Only
a small fraction of these targets advance to preclinical studies [36].
Most combination therapy drugs were originally developed as ef-
fective single agents and were later combined for clinical use [30].
Since drug effects vary with dosage, multiple doses must be tested
for combinations, leading to an exponential increase in possible
combinations. While high-throughput screening (HTS) technology
facilitates the testing of drug pairs at various doses, the combi-
natorial explosion makes it impractical to exhaustively measure
combinations involving more than two drugs. Therefore, it is essen-
tial to develop alternative methods during the discovery phase to
enhance both the efficiency of target discovery and the effectiveness
of the targets identified.
The discovery phase in the drug development pipeline for com-
bination therapy consists of two main components: (a) identify-
ing relevant target combinations and (b) developing therapeutic
compounds (e.g., drugs) that act on these targets. With the rapid
accumulation of experimental and omics data from HTS and the
increasing availability of disease-related signaling networks, there
is a growing focus on data-driven, in silico techniques to predict
effective target combinations [3, 9, 10, 15, 20, 33, 34, 37]. Most of
these methods aim to identify a set of targets that maximizes control
over deregulated genes while minimizing control over unperturbed
genes in a disease context. This approach could enhance the discov-
ery of superior drug combinations, as the identified targets can be
candidates for their potential to guide the network from a disease
state to a healthy one. Thus, in silico target combination discovery
(a.k.a multi-target selection) has the potential to serve as a powerful
discovery and pre-screening platform when integrated with com-
plementary technologies like HTS, ultimately reducing the time
and cost of the drug discovery process [11, 14, 26].
Current state-of-the-art in silico target combination techniques
do not take into account the characteristics of approved target com-
binations. A significant challenge for these methods is the compu-
tational difficulty of evaluating all 𝑘-combinations of nodes in large
signaling networks containing thousands of nodes. Additionally,
there is limited research on systematically guiding the selection of
the most promising node combination candidates for further analy-
sis. Existing approaches typically tackle this intractability challenge
in two ways. First, they often focus on small signaling networks
with only tens to hundreds of nodes [9, 10, 33, 34, 37], such as
the 167-node cancer signaling network examined in [34], which
restricts the discovery of novel target combinations. Second, they
simplify the input network to make the problem more manageable.
For instance, Hu et al. [15] convert the network into a bipartite
graph and analyze 1,000 different structural control configuration
(i.e., a spanning graph with the same node set) to identify optimal
control nodes. However, this simplification process is not informed
by the characteristics of known drug target combinations for spe-
cific cancers. Therefore, it is crucial to develop profile-driven flexible
techniques that can systematically guide the selection of candidate
node combinations in large signaling networks tailored to specific
cancer types for more effective target combination discovery.
