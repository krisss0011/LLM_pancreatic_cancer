Abstract. The in vivo propulsion and monitoring of nanoparticles (NPs) have received 
tremendous achievements in the past decade. Developing functional NPs that can be efficiently 
manipulated inside the human body with a non-invasive tracking modality is critical to clinical 
translation. This study synthesized a photo-magnetically powered nanoparticle (PMN) with a 
Fe3O4 core and gold spiky surface. The Au-nanotips ensure PMNs have a strong light 
absorption in the second near-infrared (NIR) window and produce outstanding photoacoustic 
signals. The Bio-transmission electron microscopy and simulation results prove that the 
assembly of PMNs under a magnetic field further enhances the photothermal conversion in 
cells, contributing to the reduction of ambient viscosity. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) realized 
real-time monitoring of PMN movements and revealed that laser plus magnetic coupling could 
improve intratumoral distribution and retention. The proposed methods exhibit excellent 
potential for the clinical research of cancer nanotherapies.   
1.  Introduction 
Developing micro/nanoparticles has become a further emerging field for minimally invasive 
diagnosis and therapy of diseases [1,2]. These functional therapeutic platforms can accomplish plenty 
of vital tasks for biomedical applications [3], including opening cell membranes, drug delivery, and 
biosensing. One of the most crucial limitations that hinders the in vivo utilization of 
micro/nanoparticles is the efficient propulsion inside the human body aiming to break through the 
biological barriers [4]. To overcome these difficulties, micro/nanoparticles of versatile compositions 
and structures have been designed with different actuation strategies, among which the magnetic field 
(MF), light, and ultrasonic waves are the representative external stimuli most commonly applied [5]. 
Photo-magnetically powered nanoparticles (PMNs) are hybrid nanomaterials that can obtain energy 
from the laser and MFs [6,7]. PMNs are composed of a strong light absorption part (e.g., metal or 
polydopamine [8], etc.) and a magnetic response part (e.g., Fe, Ni, or iron oxide [9], etc.) [10]. 
Compared with other manipulation techniques, the MF provides a more facile strategy for the remote 
control of PMNs with no extra functional ligands required [11]. Furthermore, the intense light 
 
 
 
 
 
 
absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) window makes PMNs excellent candidates for photothermal 
therapy and optical IR detection [12,13]. 
Tracking the in vivo locomotion of micro/nanoparticles is another critical point influencing the 
clinical translation [14]. Imaging modality with high spatiotemporal resolution is of great interest in 
monitoring nanotherapeutic activities. PMNs can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
offering outstanding contrast. However, MRI owns a temporal resolution in the millisecond range, 
which needs to be improved for studying various biological events [15], and demands expensive 
infrastructure. Other imaging methods, including ultrasound, optical coherence tomography (OCT), 
fluorescence, x-ray computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography-computed tomography 
(PET-CT) [16], and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [17], have defects of 
deficient contrast, low penetration depth, and radioactive exposure. As a result, a new powerful 
approach that can make up for the above shortages is needed. 
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) measures the ultrasonic signals from the light absorbers irradiated by 
the pulsed laser. The photoacoustic (PA) tracking of medical microbots in vivo was suggested by 
Mariana Medina-S√°nchez‚Äôs group in 2017 [18]. It could reach 150-micrometer resolutions at 2‚Äì3 
centimeter depths [19]. So far, the PA tracking of PMNs has been tested in brain vasculature [20], 
bladder, uterus [21], and tumor models [22,23] of animals, which manifests PMNs as a promising tool 
for clinical theranostics. 
This paper devised a PMN that owned a Fe3O4 core and gold-nanotip-covered shell. We elaborated 
on the feasibility of using PAI to manifest the locomotion of PMNs under the administration of laser 
and MF coupling. The designed PMNs have a broad absorption in the NIR-‚Ö° region due to the 
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and can produce strong PA signals with great 
photostability. Simulation works based on the Bio-transmission electron microscopy (Bio-TEM) 
images of cells with PMNs subjected to dual external stimuli were implemented to reveal the 
photothermal conversion of PMN assembly on microscales. Ex vivo PAI was conducted to test the 
magnetic response of PMNs. Furthermore, continuous in vivo 3D PAI was performed to track the 
intratumoral PMN distribution after injection.  
2.  Materials and methods 
2.1.  Synthesis and characterization of photo-magnetically powered nanoparticles (PMNs) 
2.1.1.  Preparation and characterization of PMNs. The synthesis and characterization of PMNs 
followed the protocols described in our previous paper [24]. The process briefly consisted of 3 steps: 
Firstly, a zinc-doped iron oxide (IO) core was prepared. Secondly, the gold nano-seed (GNS) was 
obtained based on the hydrothermal method. Thirdly, the PMNs were achieved by conjugating the 
GNSs to the surface of the IO. The spiky structures were formed by the GNS at last. The surface of 
PMN was modified to increase its cellular affinity. 
Four basic properties of PMNs were studied after preparation. Firstly, the morphological structure 
of PMN was visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI-Quanta FEG 250, America). 
Secondly, the size of PMN was calculated based on the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 
(JEM-1230, JEOL Ltd., Japan) images. Thirdly, the metallic atom contents in the PMN were 
quantified utilizing the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Thermo Fisher, 
iCAP Q). Fourthly, an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) to near-infrared region (NIR) spectroscopy (Cary 
90 UV-Vis, Agilent Technologies, America) was applied to determine the extinction spectrum. 
    The behaviors of PMNs in the bio-environment under external laser and MF were confirmed using 
Bio-TEM. The PMN solution (100 Œºg/mL, 1mL) was co-cultured with human triple-negative breast 
cancer cells (cell line: MDA-MB-231, 105 cells/well) in a dish for 24 h, and then stimulated by the 
rotating magnetic field (RMF, 260 mT, 10Hz) or RMF with continuous wave (CW) laser (0.5 W/cm2, 
1064 nm) for 5 mins.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.2.  In vitro photoacoustic (PA) signal measurements. Figure 1(a) exhibited the experimental setup 
used for measuring the PA signals of PMNs in vitro. An optical parametric oscillator (Phocus Mobile, 
OPOTEK, Carlsbad, CA) controlled by the computer program sent a pulsed laser of 1200 nm with a 
10 Hz repetition rate and 2-5 ns pulse width. The laser beam was converged via a lens into a spot of 7 
mm diameter owning a fluence of 20 mJ/cm2, which illuminated the PMN solution (1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 
0.0625 g/mL, 0.8 mL) through the opening of a glass tube. The tube was placed on a glass brick in the 
water tank to ensure the opening slightly (~3 mm) beyond the water surface. A needle hydrophone 
(HNC-1500, ONDA, Sunnyvale, CA) was exploited to collect the PA signals stemming from the 
material solution. The hydrophone was placed at 20¬∞ to the horizon and pointed at the center of the 
tube. The PA signals were amplified by 35 dB via an amplifier (5072PR, OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan) 
and stored by an oscilloscope (HDO6000, Teledyne Leroy, USA) at a sampling rate of 2500 MHz and 
64 average times. A continuous PA measurement for 60 seconds was performed to test the 
photostability of PMNs.

characterization of photo-magnetically powered nanoparticles (PMNs). (b) Experimental system for 
the in vivo 3D photoacoustic imaging (PAI) of intratumoral PMN distribution. 
2.2.  Finite element modeling (FEM) simulation of PMNs in bio-environment 
2.2.1.  Electric field. The electric field induced by the interaction between the laser and PMNs was 
simulated using the RF module of COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6. The structure of the PMN was 
modeled using the data obtained from SEM images. The placement of PMNs was set to mimic the 
assembly of PMNs within the cells under the administration of RMF (260 mT, 10Hz) or RMF+laser 
(0.5 W/cm2, 1064 nm). The laser (1064 nm, 0.5 W/cm2) was defined as a plane wave that was incident 
perpendicular to the long axis of the PMN assembly (y direction) and polarized along the axis (x 
direction). The finite element modeling (FEM) simulation was calculated based on an electromagnetic 
wave equation:

significantly greater than that of iron, the material of PMN was set as gold in the simulation. The refractive index 
was referred to the experimental data acquired by Johnson and Christy in 1972 [25]. The physical properties of 
the PMN and ambient water were obtained from the built-in database pre-stored in COMSOL 5.6. 
2.2.2.  Photothermal conversion of PMNs. The thermal field enhanced by the photothermal conversion 
of PMNs was calculated using the heat transfer module and the electromagnetic thermal coupling of 
COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6. The transformation of heat was described as follows:

2.3.  In vivo 3D PA imaging (PAI) of PMN distribution in tumors.  
Animal tumor models were established by implanting human triple-negative breast cancer cells 
(MDA-MB-231) into the groins of female BALB/c athymic nude mice. All nude mice used in this 
study were raised in the specific pathogen-free animal house of Tongji University, obeying the rules of 
the institutional animal care and use committee.  
PA detection was conducted after the nude mouse tumors reached a diameter of 1 cm (~4 weeks). 
The nude mice were divided randomly into 3 groups with 3 mice per group: Control, Laser (1064 nm, 
0.5 W/cm2, 10 mins), and Laser + rotating magnetic field (RMF) (260 mT, 10 Hz, 10 mins). PMN 
solution (20 ŒºL, 20 mg/mL) was intratumorally injected into the center of the tumor tissues. For a 
continuous tracking of the PMN locomotion, we chose 3 time points for PA imaging: before, 
immediately post, and 24-hour post-injection. Figure 1(b) shows the setup utilized for the 3D scan of 
mouse tumors. A custom-built ultrasound and PA dual-modality imaging device (TWPA, Tongji 
University, Shanghai, China & Wisonic, Guangdong, China) was applied with its laser fiber and 
ultrasound transducer being bound to a motorized linear stage (PA050, Zolix, Beijing, China). The 
fiber inclined 45 degrees to obtain the best light diffusion within tumors. A motion controller (SC300-
3A, Zolix, Beijing, China) changed the stage motion to lead the fiber and transducer to move along the 
maximum diameters of tumors. A laser of 808 nm (32 mJ/cm2) was exploited for the in vivo PA 
measurements of this study for the following reasons: First, 808 nm was a frequently used wavelength 
in the NIR window for biomedical investigation. Second, we were uncertain whether the upper energy 
limit of our OPO laser at 1200 nm (20 mJ/cm2) was sufficient to penetrate the whole mouse tumor and 
could produce enough contrast of PMNs. During PA detection, the mice were anesthetized using 
isoflurane (15%) and placed on a lifting table. The imaging was about 40 seconds, and 1 short video 
was recorded for each test. 
2.4.  In vitro real-time PAI of PMN locomotion driven by the magnetic field (MF). 
 Figure 2(a) displays the configuration of devices constructed for the in vitro PA imaging (PAI) of 
PMNs manipulated by the MF. The ultrasound transducer (L22-10-H, Wisonic, Guangdong, China) 
and the self-designed laser outlet were held together by a 3D-printed fixture. A glass tube containing 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the PMN solution (0.5 mg/mL) was placed below the transducer. The magnet was moved at a low 
speed to ensure that PMNs in the tube closely followed its motion. The laser outlet had a square shape 
with evenly distributed fibers. As shown in Figure 2(b), the laser outgoing from the outlet was 
reflected once by a mirror stuck on the fixture and irradiated at a 45-degree angle on the tube. The 
connection of the ultrasound transducer and laser fiber to other equipment was the same as depicted in 
Figure 1(b).

view. (b) Side view. 
2.5.   Data processing methods. 
 The data processing of this study was accomplished in MATLAB 2021a. The PA signal amplitude 
was obtained from the peak-to-peak value for the in vitro PA measurements of PMNs (section 2.1.2).  
For the in vivo 3D PA scanning of nude mouse tumors (section 2.3), the frames of videos were 
extracted and segmented to obtain the ultrasound and PA parts separately. The distribution of PMNs 
within the tumors was quantified according to the following equation [22]:

Where ùëêùëúùë¢ùëõùë° stands for the number of pixels. ùêº2CB-D and ùêº8E!-,E<DF are the intensity of the pixel and 
the threshold for PMNs in PA images. ùêº8E!-,E<DF was defined as 40% of the maximal pixel intensity. 
ùëÖùëÇùêº is the region of interest: the inner area of cancer, which is demarcated based on the ultrasound 
images. ùëâ/+1/-! is the volume of the cancer. ùê∑A+B and ùê∑AC1 are the maximal and minimum diameters 
of the cancer. For a clear visualization of PMN distribution in each mouse xenograft, the ultrasound 
and PA images were fused and reconstructed into 3D volume-rendered images using FUJI ImageJ 
software.  
For in vitro PAI of PMN locomotion (section 2.4), the video frames were first segmented and fused 
as described above. Then the images were reprinted in pseudo-color and fabricated into a video.  
2.6.  Statistical analysis 
The statistical analysis in this study was accomplished using GraphPad Prism 9.0. Data were 
provided as mean ¬± standard deviations (SDs) for 3 samples per group. The correlation between the 
PA signal amplitude and the PMN solution concentration was studied via simple linear regression. 
3.  Results 
3.1.  Basic properties of PMNs 
    As shown in Figure 3(a), the PMNs designed in this study owned uniform morphology with a core 
and a spiky shell. The statistical results obtained from the SEM and TEM images displayed that PMNs 
had an average diameter of 509 ¬± 38 nm, with their tips owning a length of 128 ¬± 20 nm and a 24 ¬± 4 
nm diameter at the bottoms. Gold occupied a crucial role in the composition of PMNs (more than 
90%), which acted as a strong light absorber that produced PA contrast. Iron was a small fraction of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PMNs, which ensured the MF control of PMNs. Figure 3(b) exhibits the UV-vis to NIR extinction 
spectrum of PMNs; it represented a broad absorbance peak in the NIR-‚Ö† and NIR-‚Ö° regions. The PA 
signals of PMNs increased linearly with the concentrations. PMNs remained stable within the 
illumination of a pulsed laser (1200 nm, 10 Hz, 20 mJ/cm2) for 60 seconds, as depicted in Figure 3(c) 
and 3(d). These results revealed a great potential for applying PMNs and PAI tracking in cancer 
mechanotherapy in vivo.

3.2.  MF-triggered locomotion of PMNs  
Figure 4 shows the real-time PAI of PMN movements led by the external MF. The captured frames 
proved that MF could manipulate the PMNs efficiently, and the real-time position of PMNs could be 
visualized via PAI. The laser fluence on the left side of the fiber outlet was significantly larger than 
that on the right side. The results indicated that the contrast of PAI could be tuned by adjusting the 
laser energy.

3.3.  Assembly of PMNs in cells under external stimuli 
    The Bio-TEM observation results in Figure 5(a) exhibited that PMNs assembled into short chains in 
cells under the administration of an RMF (260 mT, 10 Hz) for 5 mins. Figure 5(b) shows that 
elongated PMN chains were formed when the RMF and laser (0.5 W/cm2, 1064 nm) were applied 
simultaneously. Simulations of the electric and thermal field were conducted to discover the enhanced 
light interaction contributed by the PMN assembly on the microscale. From the comparison of Figure 
5(c) and Figure 5(d), we discovered that the elongated chain could induce a stronger electric field. 
Consequently, the photothermal conversion via PMNs was increased under the dual external stimuli, 
as shown in Figures 5(e) and Figure 5(f).

3.4.  Longitudinal monitoring of PMN distribution in tumors 
Figure 6(a)-(c) represents the continuous PA tracking results of intratumoral PMN distribution. The 
quantified results were shown in Figure 6(d) according to equation (8) and equation (9). The lifted 
PMN distribution of the laser group at 0 h was because of the extended injection position. However, 
the distribution soon reduced to the baseline due to the high tumor interstitial pressure [26]. Tumors 
subjected to the CW laser (0.5 W/cm2, 1064 nm) and RMF (260 mT, 10 Hz) for 10 mins had greater 
increases in PMN distribution after 24-hour injection compared to those of the control and the laser 
groups.

4.  Discussion 
The study of functional NPs is at an expanding stage with the growing demands of precision 
medicine. The manipulation of NPs provides an efficient technique to destroy the pathological tissues 
mechanically, which is feasible for various lesions [27]. The PA method has the advantages of non-
invasiveness, non-radiation, and high penetration depth, which is quite suitable for the in vivo tracking 
of NPs. Therefore, the application of NPs with PAI tracking shows excellent potential for the clinical 
transformation of cancer therapy. 
This study developed a novel NP with a Fe-Au core-shell structure. This PMN can respond 
simultaneously to the laser and MF as verified by the PA detection and ex vivo real-time PAI. The 
gold nano-tip-covered shell of the PMN has two critical functions that benefit cancer therapy: Firstly, 
the destructive pressure exerted on the ambient tissues is enhanced [7]. Secondly, the photothermal 
conversion is increased, which was proved by the simulation works; this can reduce the bio-
environment viscosity [28]. PMNs in cells subjected to the laser and RMF assembled into elongated 
chains compared to those under only RMF as shown by the bio-TEM observations; this suggested that 
the in vivo moving ability of PMNs was improved. Then, the continuous 3D PAI of nude mouse 
xenografts was performed to quantify the PMN distribution. The intratumoral volume proportion of 
PMNs under the administration of dual external stimuli was greater than that of no stimuli or only 
laser; it indicated that the coupling of laser and MF could enhance the locomotion and retention of 
PMNs within tumors, which offered a feasible strategy to benefit cancer therapy. 
Our research is still incomplete, and more effort needs to be made in our future works. First, we 
contrive to design different MFs to precisely control PMNs; this can further minimize the invasiveness 
and improve the effect of cancer mechanotherapy. Second, we plan to use PAI to monitor the dynamic 
process of PMN assembling. Third, we intend to utilize PAI to analyze the rotational motion of PMN 
chains under RMF. These two works aim to determine whether the actuated movement of PMNs and 
their assembly can reflect the physical properties of the bio-environment and the destructive power 
exerted on the cancer tissues. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.  Conclusion   
This study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing PAI to monitor the locomotion of PMNs 
propelled by the laser and MF intended for cancer therapy. We synthesized an NP with an iron oxide 
core and a gold-nanotip-covered shell, which has strong light absorption in the NIR-‚Ö° region because 
of the enhanced LSPR effect. The devised PMN is sensitive to the MF, as the ex vivo real-time PAI 
proves, and could produce strong and stable PA signals. The laser and MF coupling effect can 
significantly enhance energy conversion via PMNs. According to the Bio-TEM observation, elongated 
PMN chains were formed in cells subjected to dual external stimuli. As explained by the simulations, 
photothermal conversion was increased when more PMNs were activated to form a longer assembly; 
this can further reduce the viscosity of the bio-environment. The continuous 3D PAI results elaborated 
that the laser and MF coupling can elevate the PMN distribution and retention in mouse tumors after 
injection. The above results confirmed that PMN stimulated by laser-MF coupling with PAI 
monitoring provides a novel platform for precise cancer mechanotherapy with high efficacy.
