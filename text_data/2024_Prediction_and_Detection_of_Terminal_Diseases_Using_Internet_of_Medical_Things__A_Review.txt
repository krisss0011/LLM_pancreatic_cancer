The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in
healthcare, particularly through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, has
significantly advanced the prediction and diagnosis of chronic and terminal diseases. AI-driven
models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Long
Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
accuracy, achieving over 98% in predicting conditions like heart disease, chronic kidney disease
(CKD), Alzheimer’s, and lung cancer, relying on datasets sourced from public platforms like
Kaggle and UCI, as well as private medical institutions and real-time IoMT sources. Despite these
achievements, significant challenges persist. The diversity in data quality, patient demographics,
and data formats from various sources like hospitals and research initiatives poses integration
challenges. Incorporating IoMT data, which is often vast and heterogeneous, adds further com-
plexities, particularly in ensuring data interoperability and robust security measures to protect
patient privacy. AI models often encounter overfitting, demonstrating high accuracy in controlled
environments but struggling with new, unseen data in real-world clinical settings. Moreover,
significant gaps exist in addressing multi-morbidity scenarios, particularly concerning rare and
critical diseases like dementia, stroke, and various cancers. Future research must focus on advanced
data preprocessing techniques to standardize and harmonize diverse data sources, enhancing data
quality and interoperability. Techniques such as transfer learning, and ensemble methods are
essential to improve model generalizability across different clinical settings. Addressing multi-
morbidity in AI models requires a deeper exploration of disease interactions and the development
of predictive models that consider chronic illness intersections. Additionally, creating standardized
frameworks and open-source tools for integrating federated learning, blockchain, and differential
privacy into IoMT systems is critical to ensure robust data privacy and security.
1. Introduction
In the evolving landscape of healthcare technology, ar-
tificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Medical Things
(IoMT) have emerged as transformative forces, revolution-
izing the management of terminal diseases. These advance-
ments enhance diagnostic accuracy, personalize treatment
plans, improve patient monitoring, and optimize palliative
care, significantly impacting patient outcomes and qual-
ity of life. Terminal diseases, such as cancer, advanced
heart failure, and dementia, are incurable conditions that
are likely to result in death [1, 2]. These diseases pose
significant challenges due to their progressive nature and
limited treatment options. A disease that progresses to a
terminal stage typically starts with mild symptoms that can
initially be overlooked or attributed to other conditions. As
the disease advances, these symptoms worsen, gradually
impairing the patient’s daily activities and overall health.

Initially, treatment focuses on slowing disease progression
and effectively managing symptoms. However, as the dis-
ease enters its later stages, including the terminal phase,
curative treatments become less effective. Consequently,
the focus shifts to palliative care, which aims to enhance
the quality of life by alleviating symptoms such as pain,
discomfort, and emotional distress [3, 4]. Advanced-stage
chronic diseases, having progressed to severe stages with
limited treatment options, often profoundly impact both
the patient’s quality of life and life expectancy, ultimately
classifying them as terminal diseases [5, 6]. Advance-stage
organ-based illnesses, such as End-Stage Renal Disease
(ESRD) [7, 8], Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) [9, 10, 11], and End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD)
[12], are also referred to as terminal diseases. They pose
significant challenges due to their progressive nature and
limited treatment options. Patients facing terminal illnesses
often suffer from a heavy burden of symptoms, resulting in
both physical and emotional distress [13, 14].
Having established that chronic diseases at advanced
stages can progress to become terminal illnesses, it is
important to note that chronic diseases are the leading
cause of death in the United States. Heart disease alone
accounts for one-third of all fatalities, with cancer also con-
tributing significantly to annual mortality rates [15, 16, 17].

A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
Cardiovascular diseases lead to the highest number of non-
communicable disease (NCD) deaths, with 17.9 million
fatalities each year [18, 19]. They are followed by can-
cers, which cause 9.3 million deaths, chronic respiratory
diseases, responsible for 4.1 million deaths, and diabetes,
including kidney disease deaths due to diabetes, resulting
in 2.0 million deaths. Collectively, these four categories
of diseases contribute to over 80% of all premature NCD
deaths [18]. Early prediction and detection are key strate-
gies in managing these conditions effectively [20, 21].
By identifying symptoms early, healthcare providers
can initiate timely interventions, personalized treatments,
and supportive care measures to improve patient outcomes
and enhance the quality of life of the patient [22]. Enhanc-
ing end-of-life care for individuals with terminal illnesses
necessitates a focus on employing a multidisciplinary ap-
proach involving algorithms and software applications to
heighten early prediction and detection techniques, ele-
vate patient outcomes, and mitigate healthcare expenses
[23, 24]. Moreover, IoMT datasets play an increasingly
significant role in disease prediction, providing continuous
streams of data on parameters such as heart rate, physical
activity, glucose levels, and medication adherence [25].
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the
Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Medical Things
(IoMT) is revolutionizing healthcare delivery. IoMT con-
nects medical devices, enabling seamless data collection,
aggregation, and analysis. When combined with AI tech-
nologies, this interconnected network facilitates advanced
decision-making within healthcare systems, leading to sig-
nificant improvements in patient outcomes [26]. AI al-
gorithms can analyze the vast amounts of data collected
by IoMT devices to provide personalized and accurate
diagnoses. For instance, wearable devices can continuously
monitor vital signs, and AI can detect anomalies in real
time, alerting healthcare providers to potential health is-
sues before they become critical [27]. However, challenges
accompany this innovative approach, including ensuring
the availability of comprehensive datasets and address-
ing concerns regarding data privacy and security within
IoMT systems [28]. Efforts to overcome these challenges
are crucial to realize the full potential of AI and IoMT
in revolutionizing healthcare delivery and ensuring safer,
more efficient, and personalized patient care.
The scope of this systematic literature review focuses
on advancements in the prediction of chronic and terminal
diseases, particularly through the application of Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. We
will explore the effectiveness of these methodologies in
predicting diseases such as liver cancer (hepatocellular
carcinoma - HCC), lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, de-
mentia, advanced renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular
disease (CVD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD). Additionally, our review will explore how
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technologies are used
for data collection, aggregation, and analysis, while also
addressing data privacy and security in IoMT implemen-
tation. Our ultimate goal is to offer insights into state-of-
the-art approaches for predictive healthcare systems and to
explore future innovations and directions within the field.
The contribution of this review paper addresses key
issues in the field of chronic and terminal disease prediction
using ML and DL models. It examines which chronic and
terminal diseases have been effectively predicted, guiding
future research and clinical applications. It also explores
the datasets and sources used in predictive models, em-
phasizing the importance of data quality and availability
for developing robust and accurate models. Additionally,
the paper identifies the most promising ML and DL tech-
niques for accurate and reliable predictions, informing the
development of future predictive systems. Furthermore, it
investigates the types of IoMT technologies employed and
the privacy concerns associated with data collection and
deployment, providing important insights into the infras-
tructure needed for efficient and secure implementation.
The structure of the remainder of this paper is orga-
nized as follows: Section. 2 addresses the methodology of
the survey. Section. 3 discusses AI-IoMT- Based models
specifically designed for predicting these conditions. Sec-
tion. 4 provides a global discussion of the survey results
and findings. Section. 5 identifies gaps in the current liter-
ature. Section. 6 outlines future research directions. Finally,
Section. 7 presents the conclusions drawn from this study.
2. Methodology
2.1. Background of the Study
Early methods of disease prediction and detection re-
lied heavily on clinical observation and basic diagnostic
tools, such as physical examination and rudimentary lab-
oratory tests. Healthcare providers assess patients’ symp-
toms, medical histories, and visible signs of illness to make
diagnoses, often based on their clinical experience and
intuition [29, 30]. In a scenario of hypertension, the health
practitioner considers the individual’s age, family history
of hypertension, multiple monitored blood pressure read-
ings, lifestyle, and high-sodium diet, and the person is iden-
tified as being at risk for hypertension [31]. However, these
traditional approaches had significant limitations such as
subjectivity, variability in diagnostic accuracy, and a lack
of standardized protocols [32]. Challenges such as misdi-
agnosis, delayed diagnoses, and limited treatment options
prompted advancements in diagnostic techniques and tech-
nologies [33]. Over time, laboratory assays have become
more sensitive and efficient, allowing for rapid analysis
of samples and the detection of disease-related biomark-
ers [34, 35]. Similarly, advancements in medical imaging
have led to detailed visualizations of internal structures,
enhancing diagnostic accuracy and facilitating prompt in-
tervention [36, 37]. Screening initiatives have broadened
their focus to include populations at higher risk, employing
advanced algorithms to identify diseases sooner and im-
prove outcomes across various conditions [38]. Challenges

A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
affecting laboratory and scanning diagnostic methods, such
as false positives, false negatives, and the demand for
personalized health services, have prompted the adoption
of AI technologies in clinical practice [39, 40]. These
technologies provide improved accuracy, efficiency, and
personalized care in disease detection and patient manage-
ment [41].
However, despite advancements in healthcare technol-
ogy, research into predicting and diagnosing chronic and
terminal diseases confronts notable challenges, particularly
regarding data quality and dimensionality. [42, 43], device
reliability and interoperability, and advanced algorithms
[44], the difficulty in symptom-based prediction [45] and
the under-utilization of healthcare data due to privacy
issues [46], challenges such as inference attacks, differ-
ential privacy, adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model
and data tampering, and compliance with data protection
regulations make safeguarding data privacy and security in
AI applications essential, thereby reducing the availabil-
ity of datasets [47]. Similarly utilizing IoMT devices to
detect and diagnose chronic diseases presents significant
data privacy and security challenges. These devices collect
sensitive patient data, making them vulnerable to cyber-
attacks that could compromise patient confidentiality [48].
Implementing robust data security measures is essential to
protect patient information and ensure the reliability and
safety of chronic and terminal disease diagnoses via IoMT
devices [49, 50].
2.2. Data Availability for AI-Based IoMT
Chronic and Terminal Disease Prediction
Datasets essential for AI-based disease prediction are
available in both public and private repositories, serving
as fundamental resources for IoMT system research and
development. However, datasets specifically tailored for
IoMT applications are typically inaccessible to the public
due to stringent privacy regulations that govern medical
data. For instance, regulations such as the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in
the United States impose strict guidelines on the collection,
storage, and sharing of sensitive health information [51,
52]. These regulations prioritize patient confidentiality and
aim to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of personal
health data. As a result, researchers and developers often
work with anonymized or aggregated datasets to comply
with these regulations while still advancing IoMT tech-
nologies and applications [53, 54].
Meanwhile, publicly accessible datasets relevant to
IoMT or medical IoT are available on platforms such as
Kaggle, UCI, and through public institutions, providing
valuable resources for advancing IoMT technologies. For
instance, Rash et al. (2022) utilized data from UCI sources
to develop a predictive model for diseases such as breast
cancer, diabetes, heart attack, hepatitis, and kidney disease.
They employed Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to
extract features from these datasets and achieved high
accuracy rates with their ANN model, with 98.23% for
breast cancer and 98.90% for kidney disease, surpassing
other algorithms tested [55] while private datasets typi-
cally originate from medical centers, hospitals, research
institutions, and occasional collaborations with private
entities. David et al. (2021) utilized federated learning for
distributed model training, leveraging a private dataset of
600,000 patient records to develop a deep learning-based
multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN) for early
chronic illness detection, achieving high accuracy, low
error rates, and high precision [56].
Integrating data from multiple and diverse sources
presents significant challenges such as data inconsistency,
heterogeneity, unstructured formats, quality issues, seman-
tic discrepancies, scalability concerns, privacy and security
risks, real-time integration difficulties, and high costs and
resource requirements [57]. To data consistency a uniform
data integration approach is essential, followed by data pre-
processing to address issues such as missing or duplicate
data, normalization, and data accuracy. Certain diseases
require specialized datasets for accurate prediction, driven
by factors such as disease complexity, rarity, or the need for
specific data modalities. For instance, chronic conditions
often necessitate longitudinal datasets that track patients’
health outcomes over extended periods. The Cancer Imag-
ing Archive (TCIA) exemplifies this need as it houses a vast
repository of cancer-related imaging and associated data
for the U.S. National Cancer Institute. With 30.9 million
radiology images from about 37,568 subjects, organized
by tumor type, TCIA provides comprehensive resources
including analytic results and clinical data [58]. Another is
the National Institutes of Health, NIH dataset containing
82 abdominal CT scans focused on the pancreas, enhanced
with contrast for improved visualization and featuring a
resolution of 512 × 512 pixels. It includes scans from
53 male and 27 female subjects, aged between 18 and
76 years. Among them are 17 healthy kidney donors and
additional patients without pancreatic lesions. For precise
labeling, a medical student manually annotated each CT
slice under the guidance of an experienced radiologist [59].
The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
database is designed to identify and track the progres-
sion of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) employing various data
collection modalities, including MRI for structural brain
imaging, PET for metabolic and amyloid plaque imaging,
clinical and neuropsychological assessments for cognitive
evaluation, biomarker analyses from cerebrospinal fluid
and blood samples, and genetic data. This comprehensive
dataset facilitates early diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and
pathophysiological studies while enhancing clinical trial
methodologies [60]. Similarly, OASIS-3 is a longitudinal,
multimodal dataset on normal aging and Alzheimer’s
disease from WUSTL Knight ADRC, spanning 30 years.
It includes 1,378 participants aged 42-95, with 755 cog-
nitively normal and 622 cognitively impaired individuals.
The dataset offers 2,842 MRI sessions, over 2,157 PET
A.T Otapo et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
scans with multiple tracers, and 451 Tau PET sessions, all
anonymized with normalized dates [61].
In addition, the MIMIC-III database is a comprehen-
sive, single-center repository containing detailed patient
information from critical care units at a large tertiary care
hospital. The database is openly accessible and includes
a wide range of data such as vital signs, medications,
laboratory results, care provider observations and notes,
fluid balance, procedure and diagnostic codes, imaging
reports, hospital length of stay, and survival data. [62]. Fur-
thermore, [63] unveiled approximately forty-eight public
databases on biomedical datasets associated with chronic
illnesses, describing each dataset’s characteristics such as
therapeutic areas covered, sample size, publication year,
and available features like socio-demographic, clinical,
physical activity, time-series, and psychometric data. Addi-
tionally, the report highlights whether the dataset is stored
in an archival repository with a Digital Object Identifier
(DOI), if there is a related publication of its utilization,
and if comprehensive ethics statements and anonymization
details are included in the data release. Further points of
interest include the accessibility of the datasets, poten-
tial usage restrictions, data quality assessments, and any
collaboration opportunities offered through the datasets.
Extractions from these datasets and other relevant dataset
sources provide comprehensive insights into publicly avail-
able biomedical information for chronic diseases including
cancer, diabetes, heart diseases, brain disorders, and more
across a wide spectrum. This initiative aims to raise aware-
ness about the wealth of resources available for studying
chronic diseases, as outlined in Table 6. providing details
such as year of release, disease area, dataset name, partici-
pant numbers, data type, and sources for each study.
2.2.1. Comparative Analysis of Predictive
Performance of Selected Datasets
Alzheimer’s disease prediction using ADNI-MRI datasets
The progression and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD) have been enhanced through imaging modalities and
machine learning. A study using MRI data showed that an-
alyzing the hippocampus (H), entorhinal cortex (EC), and
middle temporal cortex (MTC) provided strong predictive
performance, with the EC as the most effective predictor,
achieving AUC values of 0.86, 0.85, and 0.82 for 1, 2, and
3-year predictions, respectively [64]. Another study com-
bined MRI and PET data with discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) and VGG16, using a vision transformer to classify
fused images, achieving 81.25% and 93.75% accuracies for
MRI and PET, respectively [65]. A comparative analysis
proposed an ensemble model (XGB + DT + SVM) that
achieved 95.75% accuracy [66]. Additionally, a CGAN
model using MRI and PET data improved classification
accuracy to 94% by extracting and fusing structural and
metabolic features[67]. Table 1. shows the summary of
these approaches to Alzheimer’s disease prediction using
ADNI-MRI datasets.

Alzheimer’s disease prediction using OASIS 3-MRI
datasets. Recent studies on Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
detection using OASIS 3-MRI data have explored various
advanced methods to improve accuracy and reliability. One
approach combines CNN, RNN, and LSTM models with
Bagging to enhance performance, achieving an accuracy
of 92.22% compared to 89.75% without Bagging [68].
Another study employs an ensemble voting method, sur-
passing traditional techniques with an impressive 96.4% ac-
curacy and 97.2% AUC on the OASIS dataset [69]. A third
study focuses on CNNs integrated with Transfer Learning
and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), demon-
strating significant accuracy improvements of up to 40.1%
over existing methods [70]. Additionally, a novel approach
combines clinical, MRI segmentation, and psychological
data using nine machine learning models, with Random
Forest achieving the highest performance at 98.81% accu-
racy, and employs SHAP for model explainability [71]. Ta-

Liver disease prediction using UCI Indian Liver Pa-
tient dataset (ILPD). Advancements in liver disease pre-
diction have leveraged machine learning techniques to en-
hance diagnostic accuracy. One study applied various clas-
sification algorithms using WEKA on liver patient data,
achieving a maximum accuracy of 74.2% [72]. Another
model focused on predicting the probability of liver disease
progression using logistic regression, achieving 72.4% ac-
curacy, 90.3% sensitivity, and 78.3% specificity with the
ILPD dataset [73]. A third study compared SVM and lo-
gistic regression, noting that SVM achieved 88% accuracy,
though both algorithms showed decreased performance
with PCA and SMOTE preprocessing [74]. Additionally,
a novel approach utilized ensemble learning and advanced
preprocessing methods on the ILPD dataset, with the Extra
Tree classifier and Random Forest achieving high accu-
racies of 91.82% and 86.06%, respectively [75]. Finally,
a comprehensive evaluation of twelve machine learning
algorithms on the BUPA Liver Disease dataset found De-
cision Tree to be the most effective, with an accuracy of
86.67% [76]. Table 3. shows summary of approaches to
liver disease prediction using UCI Indian Liver Patient
dataset (ILPD).

A.T Otapo et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier
Page 5 of 37
A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
are "AI", "IoMT", "Chronic Disease", and "Prediction".
Additionally, filters were applied to focus on journal ar-
ticles, conference papers, and reviews within relevant
subject areas such as Computer Science, Medicine, and
Engineering.
Furthermore, various recent literature surveys on AI
and IoMT applications in chronic disease prediction and
management are assessed highlighting several critical gaps
in each of the related survey papers. Souza-Pereira et
al.’s (2020) survey paper lacks focus on major chronic
and terminal diseases in clinical decision support systems.
Similarly, Xie et al.’s (2021) paper lacks broader inclu-
sion of key ML techniques and other chronic diseases.
Ahsan et al.’s (2022) paper does not sufficiently integrate
the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with ML-based
diagnostic systems, particularly for major chronic and ter-
minal diseases. Anilkumar et al.’s (2023) work lacks the
utilization of advanced AI techniques and IoMT in multi-
chronic disease prediction. Ajagbe et al.’s (2024) paper
lacks the application of IoMT and deep learning techniques
to both pandemics and chronic diseases. Lastly, Merabet
et al.’s (2024) paper lacks detail on the integration of data
privacy and security in AI and IoMT applications. These
gaps highlight the necessity of our survey paper to fill these

be assessed due to inaccessible full texts and lack of re-
sponse from authors within the study period. Furthermore,
486 articles did not meet our inclusion criteria based on
the keywords "Prediction and Detection" and "Chronic or
Terminal Disease". Ultimately, 67 full-text papers met the
primary inclusion criteria, with 20 full-text papers on the
final inclusion criteria focusing on AI-IoMT-based models
for predicting single or multiple chronic and terminal dis-
eases.

disease (CVD) is the most frequently covered disease with
16 papers, followed by chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
multiple diseases, each with 10 papers. Alzheimer’s disease
and liver disease have 9 and 7 papers, respectively. Other
conditions, such as pancreatic disease, lung disease, stroke,
and dementia, have fewer papers, ranging from 2 to 6. Ad-
ditionally, 34 papers use machine learning (ML) models,
and 33 papers use deep learning (DL) models.
3. AI-IoMT-Based Model for Predicting
Chronic and Terminal Diseases
This section explores the significant influence of ML,
DL, and IoMT on healthcare, focusing on disease pre-
diction and management. It encompasses conditions such
as dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease
(CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) , and liver, lung, and pancreatic diseases
[18, 19]. Integrating these algorithms within the framework
of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) underscores the
creation of accurate predictive models while emphasizing
data privacy and security measures. In the Machine Learn-
ing approaches section, essential ML techniques such as
XGBoost and Random Forest are central for precise disease
prediction and management. Ensemble methods like Gradi-
ent Boosting and Bagging further enhance predictive accu-
racy by combining multiple ML models, thereby increasing
reliability across diverse healthcare datasets. Conversely,
the Deep Learning section highlights the transformative
impact of DL models such as Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and
variations like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). CNNs
excel in extracting features from imaging technologies such
as MRI and CT scans, while RNNs analyze time-series
data to monitor disease progression and detect early indi-
cators. The integration of IoMT explores their combined
potential in enabling real-time monitoring and personalized
healthcare solutions. Robust encryption protocols and se-
cure data transmission mechanisms ensure patient privacy
and confidentiality, addressing ethical concerns inherent in
healthcare data management.

3.1. ML Techniques Deployed for Chronic and
Terminal Disease Prediction
Disease prediction research has advanced significantly
by integrating cutting-edge machine learning (ML) algo-
rithms, sophisticated feature extraction methods, and ro-
bust privacy measures, ensuring high accuracy and se-
cure data handling across diverse healthcare datasets. This
comprehensive exploration covers cardiovascular diseases
(CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, liver,
lung, and pancreatic diseases, as well as multiple diseases.
CVD prediction employs advanced ML techniques like
Bagging-Fuzzy-GBDT and Spark MLlib within Internet of
Medical Things (IoMT) infrastructures, providing high ac-
curacy while maintaining robust data privacy. CKD/ESRD
prediction utilizes algorithms such as XGBoost and AN-
FIS for precise identification of disease stages and risk
factors. Dementia and Alzheimer’s prediction leverages
ML models like Random Forest and Fuzzy Rule-Based
Systems, using neuroimaging and wearable sensor data for
high accuracy. Liver, lung, and pancreatic disease predic-
tion uses algorithms like XGBoost and Federated Deep
Extreme Machine Learning, demonstrating superior sen-
sitivity, specificity, and generalizability. Multiple disease
prediction integrates optimized techniques such as ANN-
PSO and Multilayer Perceptron, achieving exceptional ac-
curacy and efficiency.
In the following subsections, we will provide a detailed
analysis of each family of chronic and terminal diseases
prediction using machine learning models
3.1.1. CVD (Heart Disease) Prediction
The landscape of heart disease prediction research
showcases advanced methodologies, diverse datasets, and
critical privacy measures to improve accuracy and data se-
curity in healthcare. Each study offers unique insights and
innovations, shaping the future of personalized medicine.
Zhang et al. (2018) introduced a Privacy-Preserving Dis-
ease Prediction (PPDP) scheme using Single-Layer Percep-
tron (SLP) classifiers, securing medical data in cloud envi-
ronments while achieving strong predictive performance
[91]. Adewole et al. (2021) developed an IoMT Cloud-
based Personalized Healthcare Model (CPHM) integrating
SVM, Naïve Bayes, and KNN on a large-scale Kaggle
dataset, emphasizing scalability and data efficiency with
robust security measures like digital watermarking [92].
Yuan et al. (2022) presented an AI-Based Heart Disease
Prediction Model using the Bagging-Fuzzy-GBDT algo-
rithm, demonstrating high accuracy and privacy strategies
within IoMT infrastructures [93]. Ed-daoudy et al. (2024)
utilized Spark MLlib and algorithms like RF and SVM in a
scalable architecture supporting real-time data processing
and secure patient data handling [94]. Asif et al. (2023)
explored ensemble learning techniques with Extra Tree
Classifier, RF, XGBoost, and CatBoost, enhancing heart
disease prediction through rigorous model optimization
and validation [95]. Ogunpola et al. (2024) achieved sig-
nificant accuracy using ML classifiers expecailly with XG-
Boost on datasets from Mendeley and Kaggle, emphasizing
privacy measures like encryption and differential privacy in
IoMT for real-time health monitoring [96].
3.1.2. CKD/ESRD Prediction
The prediction of kidney disease stages and associated
risk factors has been extensively explored using various
A.T Otapo et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier
Page 8 of 37
A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
data mining and machine learning algorithms. E. A. Radya
and A. S. Anwar (2019) employed multiple algorithms, in-
cluding Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and
Radial Basis Function (RBF), to predict chronic kidney dis-
ease (CKD) stages. Their study, using a dataset of 361 CKD
Indian patients from the UCI machine learning repository,
found that the PNN algorithm exhibited particularly high
accuracy across different CKD stages [97]. Md. A. Islam et
al. (2020) identified risk factors for CKD using algorithms
such as Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random
Forest (RF), and Linear Regression (LR). Their research
highlighted that the Random Forest algorithm achieved the
highest accuracy at 98.8858%, with hemoglobin identified
as a significant risk factor for CKD [98].
In a large-scale study, Z. Segal et al. (2020) used
the XGBoost algorithm to predict end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) risk from over 20 million medical insurance claims
from a major U.S. health insurance company. The XG-
Boost model demonstrated high performance, achieving
a C-statistic of 0.93, sensitivity of 0.715, and specificity
of 0.958 [99]. P. Ventrella et al. (2021) evaluated the
progression of CKD using data from Vimercate Hospital’s
Electronic Medical Records (EMR). They applied various
machine learning algorithms, including ExtraTrees clas-
sifier, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks,
and Logistic Regression. The ExtraTrees classifier showed
high accuracy in predicting the need for dialysis in CKD
patients, with accuracies of 0.94 for two classes, 0.91 for
three classes, and 0.87 for four classes [100]. K.H. Lee et
al. (2022) focused on predicting ESRD risk among sepsis
survivors with CKD using algorithms like Random Forest,
Extra Trees, XGBoost, LGBM, and Gradient Boosting
Decision Tree (GBDT). The GBDT algorithm achieved
the highest area under the receiver operating characteris-
tic curve (AUC) of 0.879. Their study initially identified
112,628 CKD patients using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and,
after applying exclusion criteria, enrolled 11,661 eligible
sepsis survivors with a history of CKD [101].
Lastly, Murugesan G et al. (2022) integrated fuzzy
logic with neural network capabilities through the ANFIS
algorithm to analyze patient data related to various CKD
risk factors. Their model achieved an accuracy of 93.75%,
with high sensitivity, specificity, and precision rates [102].
3.1.3. Dementia and Alzheimer’s Prediction
The studies present significant advancements in pre-
dicting dementia and Alzheimer’s disease using various
machine learning models and datasets. Miled et al. (2020)
employed a Random Forest (RF) model to predict dementia
using routine care electronic medical records (EMR) data,
achieving a generalizable model with 77.43% accuracy,
76.01% sensitivity, and 74.16% specificity. Their dataset
included both structured data like prescriptions and diag-
noses, as well as unstructured data such as medical notes,
encompassing features like age, gender, and race [103]. El-
Sappagh et al.(2021) developed a two-layered model using
RF classifiers, Decision Trees, and Fuzzy Rule-Based Sys-
tems to predict cognitive states and Alzheimer’s progres-
sion. They achieved cross-validation accuracies of 93.95%
and 87.08% in the first and second layers, respectively,
using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI). Their model emphasized interpretabil-
ity and trustworthiness with the SHAP framework [104].
The study by Yingjie Li et al. (2020) employs Principal
Analysis through Conditional Expectation (PACE) to ex-
tract functional principal component scores from sparse
and irregularly spaced measurements. This methodology
achieved an overall sensitivity of around 80%, specificity
above 70%, accuracy around 75%, and AUC above 80%.
Notably, the entorhinal cortex (EC) was identified as the
best predictor with AUCs above 0.83 for both 1-year and
2-year advanced predictions, utilizing data from the AD-
NIMERGE file, which includes MRI data and correspond-
ing clinical information for subjects with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) [64].
Further advancing the methodology, Chatterjee et al.
(2022) utilized a combination of Support Vector Machine
(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression,
and Naive Bayes. Their approach achieved the highest
accuracy of 96.43% in classifying Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD). The study was based on the OASIS project data,
including longitudinal and cross-sectional brain MRI data.
This dataset consisted of 150 patients aged 18 to 96 years,
with 72 patients categorized as having no dementia and 64
patients classified as having dementia at their first visits
[69]. Khan et al. (2022) integrated multiple models such
as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Gradi-
ent Boosting (GB), XGBoost (XGB), and Support Vector
Machine (SVM) with various kernels. They proposed an
ensemble model combining XGB, Decision Tree (DT),
and SVM, which outperformed all other models with an
efficiency of 95.75%. Their dataset comprised 2127 MRI
(T1 and T2 weighted) images from the ADNI website, cate-
gorized into three classes: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Control Normal (CN)
[66]. Jahan et al. (2023) compared nine popular machine
learning models for Alzheimer’s prediction, demonstrating
high accuracy scores ranging from 94.51% to 98.94% using
the OASIS-3 dataset, which includes extensive longitudinal
neuroimaging, cognitive, clinical, and biomarker data. Ad-
ditionally, they innovated with the use of wearable sensor
bands for continuous data collection, processed through a
mist layer for real-time analysis [71].
3.1.4. COPD, Lung, Liver, and Pancreatic Disease
Prediction
M. Moll et al. (2020) developed a Machine Learning
Mortality Prediction (MLMP) model for chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease (COPD) using Cox regression and
random survival forest techniques. The MLMP model sur-
passed existing models like BODE and ADO in predict-
ing all-cause mortality across two large COPD cohorts.
It was developed using data from 2,632 participants in
A.T Otapo et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier
Page 9 of 37
A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
the COPDGene Study and validated on 1,268 participants
from the ECLIPSE Study, achieving a C index of at least
0.7 [105]. In the realm of liver disease prediction, S.
Rajesh et al. (2020) employed five ML algorithms—KNN,
Naïve Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and SVM—to
predict Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The study used
two datasets, HCC STo from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository and a Kaggle dataset, comprising 49 attributes.
Random forest and KNN achieved the highest accuracies
of 79.46% and 79.04%, respectively, with random forest
reaching 80.64% without cross-validation [106]. For lung
disease prediction, S. Abbas et al. (2023) implemented a
Fused Weighted Federated Deep Extreme Machine Learn-
ing (FDEML) model to predict lung cancer. This model
integrated federated learning and deep extreme machine
learning techniques, achieving a high accuracy of 96.30%.
The study addressed data fragmentation and privacy con-
cerns by employing federated learning, allowing collab-
orative model development without sharing sensitive pa-
tient data. The dataset comprised 309 cases from IoMT
sensors, supplemented by 231 records, highlighting the
significance of IoMT-based data in enhancing prediction
accuracy [107].
In the realm of liver disease prediction, Barus et al.
(2022) focused on employing supervised machine learning
models, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
Logistic Regression (LR). They used the Indian Liver
Patient Dataset (ILPD), which contains 583 patient records
with 11 features each. In their preprocessing stage, they ap-
plied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Synthetic
Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to evaluate
their impact on the performance of the machine learning
models. Initially, without PCA and SMOTE, LR achieved
an accuracy of 70%, while SVM reached 88%. After incor-
porating PCA and SMOTE, the accuracy of LR decreased
to 64%, and SVM’s accuracy slightly dropped to 87%. This
indicates that the preprocessing techniques did not enhance
and even slightly reduced the performance of the models
in this context [74]. Md et al. (2023) adopted a different
approach by leveraging various ensemble learning algo-
rithms to improve the accuracy of liver disease prediction
using the same ILPD dataset. They explored models such
as Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Bagging, Random Forest,
Extra Tree, and Stacking. The results were promising,
with Gradient Boosting achieving a testing accuracy of
91.82% and Stacking ensemble attaining 86.06%. These
findings highlight the superiority of ensemble learning
methods in enhancing predictive accuracy, outperforming
the single models used in other studies [75]. Likewise,
Kumar et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive evaluation
using a broad spectrum of machine learning models on the
ILPD dataset. Their study included Decision Tree (DT), K-
Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
AdaBoost (AB), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting
(GB), XGBoost (XGB), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive
Bayes (NB), Extra Tree (ET), LightGBM (LGBM), and
SVM. Among these, the Decision Tree model exhibited
robust performance, with an accuracy of 86.67%, precision
of 0.87, recall of 0.87, and F1-Score of 0.86. This suggests
that DT is a viable and effective model for liver disease
prediction, offering balanced and reliable metrics across
various performance indicators [76].
In addition, Warda M. Shaban (2023) in Liver Pa-
tients Detection Strategy (LPDS) employs machine learn-
ing classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes (NB),
Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) on a train-
ing set to classify patients and determine infection status
through data preprocessing, feature selection, and clas-
sification phases. The LPDS model’s performance met-
rics include an accuracy of 89.5%, sensitivity of 91.2%,
specificity of 87.3%, F1 score of 0.89, and AUC of 0.92.
Additionally, the KNN classifier obtained the highest clas-
sification accuracy of 99.1% on the test dataset. The dataset
used is the Kaggle Liver dataset with a total of 441 records
[108]. Similarly, Ruhul Amin et al. (2023) in their study,
combines Factor Analysis (FA) with Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) for feature selection and classification.
The model uses machine learning techniques such as Ran-
dom Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic
Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), and Boosted Regression Trees
(BRT) to predict and diagnose liver diseases. The system
achieves an accuracy of 88.10%, precision of 85.33%, recall
of 92.30%, F1 score of 88.68%, and an AUC score of
88.20%. The study’s results outperform existing studies by
0.10-18.5%. Further exploration and fine-tuning of model
parameters are recommended to improve the AUC score.
The dataset used is the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)
from the UCI machine learning repository, consisting of
583 observations with ten liver function-related features
and one target output [109].
In the realm of pancreatic disease, Li et al. (2018)
developed a Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) model for
pancreatic cancer that involves three main steps: pancreas
segmentation, feature extraction and selection, and classi-
fier design. The segmentation process uses Simple Linear
Iterative Clustering (SLIC) on CT pseudo-color images
from the General Image Processing (GIP) method. Fea-
ture selection and combination are performed using Deci-
sion Tree-Principal Component Analysis (DT-PCA), and
a hybrid model combining Hierarchical Feature Bagging-
Support Vector Machine-Random Forest (HFB-SVM-RF)
is used for classification. The model achieved an accuracy
of 96.47%, a sensitivity of 95.23%, and a specificity of
97.51%. It was evaluated using the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) dataset, obtaining a mean Dice coefficient of
78.9% and a Jaccard index of 65.4%. The dataset comprised
PET/CT data from 80 patients, each with approximately
1700 DICOM images, and the labels were confirmed by
three nuclear medicine experts [77]. W. Muhammad et
al. (2019) focused on predicting pancreatic cancer risk
using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. This study
utilized data from the NHIS and PLCO trials, incorporating
18 personal health features to develop and train the model
A.T Otapo et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
achieving high sensitivity and specificity, with an AUC of
0.85 for the test dataset and 0.86 for the training dataset
[78].
In a related application, Y. Zhou et al. (2022) developed
predictive models for the severity of acute pancreatitis
(AP) using five ML algorithms: logistic regression (LR),
support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), random
forest (RF), and XGBoost. Data preprocessing included
Minmax scaling, one-hot encoding, and handling missing
values with the MissForest package. XGBoost showed su-
perior performance with an AUC of 0.906, high accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, and an F1 score of 0.764 [110].
B. Kui et al. (2022) also tackled the prediction of acute
pancreatitis severity using ML algorithms such as decision
tree, random forest, logistic regression, SVM, CatBoost,
and XGBoost. Addressing missing data and imbalanced
classes with KNNImputer and SMOTE, XGBoost achieved
the best performance with an AUC of 0.81 and an accuracy
of 89.1%. This study involved an international cohort of
1184 patients for model development and 3543 for valida-
tion, utilizing data from multiple centers to enhance model
generalizability. Additionally, the study developed an easy-
to-use web application to improve model accessibility and
usability [111].
3.1.5. Multiple Diseases Prediction
N.K. Sbehara et al. (2015) conducted a study on the
classification of thyroid, hepatitis, and heart diseases using
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models enhanced by Bird
Mating Optimization (BMO) and Firefly Algorithm (FFA).
Their research demonstrated that MLP-BMO generally
outperformed MLP-FFA, especially for heart and liver
diseases, as evidenced by Mean Squared Error (MSE) com-
parisons. Specifically, the MSE for liver diseases showed
MLP-FFA with a range from 2.8892 to 4.1277 (average
2.9456, standard deviation 0.4425), whereas MLP-BMO
had a range from 2.8002 to 4.0714 (average 2.9802, stan-
dard deviation 0.3534) [112].
Akkem Yaganteeswarudu (2020) conducted a study on
multi-disease prediction using machine learning, Tensor-
Flow, and Flask API, with a thorough parameter analysis to
optimize disease effect detection. The study utilized Python
pickling for saving and loading model behavior and incor-
porated various machine learning and deep learning tech-
niques, including logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, SVM,
decision tree, and random forest algorithms. Notably, lo-
gistic regression achieved a 92% accuracy rate for diabetes
analysis, random forest yielded 95% accuracy for heart
disease classification, and SVM reached 96% accuracy
for cancer detection. Additionally, TensorFlow convolu-
tional neural networks were employed for diabetic retinopa-
thy analysis, achieving 91% accuracy. The study’s model
demonstrated impressive performance with high accuracy
rates across different diseases. The datasets used included
the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset for diabetes analysis, over
150 GB of image data from the UCI machine learning
repository for diabetic retinopathy prediction, heart disease
patient data from Cleveland, Hungarian, and Switzerland,
and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set for
cancer prediction and live data sets from corresponding
hospitals [113].
P. Singh et al. (2021) presented a diagnostic model for
heart disease and multi-disease conditions that integrates
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and beetle foraging
behavior for optimization within a five-layer structure gov-
erned by fuzzy rules. Evaluated via MATLAB, the BSO-
ANFIS model achieved impressive results, with an accu-
racy of 99.1% and precision of 99.37% for heart disease
classification, and an accuracy of 96.08% and precision of
98.63% for multi-disease classification. The study suggests
potential improvements through further accuracy investi-
gation and the integration of diverse data types such as
images, audio, or video. The heart disease dataset was
sourced from Kaggle, while the multi-disease dataset was
from USA healthcare services [114].
J. Rash et al. (2022) focused on predicting five chronic
diseases—diabetes, breast cancer, hepatitis, heart disease,
and kidney disease—using an Artificial Neural Network
(ANN) optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
achieving a peak accuracy of 99.67%, surpassing other
benchmark methods and demonstrating faster processing
times compared to Random Forest (RF), deep learning, and
Support Vector Machine (SVM). Specifically, ANN-PSO
outperformed traditional methods like Logistic Regres-
sion (LR: 68.97% accuracy), SVM (98.23% accuracy), K-
Nearest Neighbors (KNN: 94.69% accuracy), Naive Bayes
(NB: 97.35% accuracy), and Decision Trees (DT: 95.58%
accuracy). The datasets utilized were obtained from online
sources like Kaggle, Dataworld, Github, and the UCI ma-
chine learning repository, ensuring a diverse and compre-
hensive data foundation for the study [55].
Table 7 summarizes all the thirty-four studies that apply
various ML techniques such as RF, DT, LR, XGBoost,
SVM, KNN, NB, LGBM, GBDT, ANN, etc., to predict and
analyze chronic diseases. Each study is categorized by dis-
ease type and ML model used, with reported performance
metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, ROC
AUC, and F1-score. Dataset descriptions encompass di-
verse sources from medical imaging to clinical records. No-
tably, integration with Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)
data and stringent data privacy measures are highlighted
across studies to protect.
3.2. DL Techniques Deployed for Terminal
Disease Prediction
The integration of deep learning algorithms with the
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) transforms healthcare
diagnostics and disease management, especially for chronic
and severe conditions like cardiovascular diseases, chronic
kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, stroke, COPD, and liver dis-
ease. These technologies use algorithms such as Convolu-
tional Neural Networks (CNNs), Enhanced Deep Learning

to analyze medical imaging data precisely, help healthcare
providers detect subtle abnormalities more accurately. In-
novations like EDCNN and DLMNN refine standard CNN
architectures, enhancing their ability to interpret complex
medical data patterns. AHDCNN and HFDNN models
combine deep learning with fuzzy logic or adaptive learn-
ing mechanisms, allowing nuanced decision-making in
diagnostics. The IoMT enables continuous monitoring and
real-time analysis of patient data for early detection and
timely intervention in chronic diseases.
In the following subsections, we will provide a detailed
analysis of each family of chronic and terminal diseases

3.3. CVD (Heart Disease) Prediction
The studies in this subsection underscore the transfor-
mative potential of deep learning and IoT in CVD-Heart
Disease prediction and diagnosis. Using algorithms like
CNNs, DLMNN, Bi-LSTM, and hybrid models, they show
significant improvements in accuracy, specificity, and sen-
sitivity. IoMT enables continuous monitoring and real-time
analysis, crucial for early detection. Emphasis on data secu-
rity through encryption enhances patient privacy and trust.
Y. Pan et al. (2020) introduced an Enhanced Deep Learn-
ing Assisted Convolutional Neural Network (EDCNN) for
precise heart disease prediction and diagnosis, achieving
an impressive accuracy of 97.51%, with sensitivity and
specificity scores of 93.51% and 94.9%, respectively. Uti-
lizing clinical data from the UCI repository, including

mization Algorithm (CFOA) for heart disease prediction
using the Hungarian Heart Disease dataset, achieving an
accuracy of 92%, outperformed traditional Artificial Neu-
ral Networks (ANN) and demonstrated superior sensitivity,
specificity, and f-measure. The study emphasizes using a
network of body sensors to collect and analyze vital signs
such as breathing rates, blood pressure, pulse, and body
temperature. This collected data is then transmitted to a
healthcare application where it is stored and analyzed for
medical purposes. Secure data transmission via PDH-AES

volutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, achieving
over 97% training accuracy and 96% test accuracy on
the Cleveland heart disease dataset.Recommendations in-
cluded integrating wearable sensors and expanding param-

[117]. A. Kumar et al. (2022) explored various models,
including Naive Bayes, SVM, k-NN, CNN, and ANN,
for early heart attack prediction. The CNN model outper-
formed others with an accuracy of 98%, precision of 97%,
and an average F-score of 98%. Using the UCI dataset,
suggesting higher performance of deep learning models
[118]. Similarly, S. M. Nagarajan et al. (2022) developed
a model combining Decision Trees (DT), SVM, Random
Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB) into an ensemble clas-
sifier with a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN).
The model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% with
original features and 95.34% with extracted features across
ten different medical datasets,suggesting higher perfor-
mance of deep learning models [119]. S. Manimurugan
et al. (2022) proposed a two-stage classification model
using hybrid linear discriminant analysis with modified
ant lion optimization for sensor data and a hybrid Faster
R-CNN with SE-ResNet-101 for echocardiogram images.
The model achieved up to 99.15% accuracy for image clas-
sification utilizing the Cleveland dataset.The study high-
lighted IoMT’s role in securely collecting and transmitting
sensor data to the cloud. Data privacy was maintained by
storing medical data in a secure cloud database [120]. A.
A. Nancy et al. (2022) combined a fuzzy system with a
Bi-LSTM model for heart disease risk prediction, achiev-
ing performance metrics ranging from 98.03% to 98.90%.
Utilizing augmented Cleveland and Hungarian datasets
up to 100,000 records, the study stressed the need for
robust encryption, access controls, and ethical guidelines
to ensure patient data privacy, highlighting the pivotal role
of IoMT in remote patient monitoring and real-time data
transmission to the cloud [121]. L. Kumar et al. (2023)
utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on
ECG signals and patient clinical data, achieving a 98.5%
accuracy rate. The research dataset for heart disease pre-
diction includes data from 2015 to 2020, covering a total of
316,980 individuals. This includes 2,976 individuals with
heart failure, 18,203 individuals closely connected to heart

A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
3.3.1. CKD/ESRD
Several notable studies have investigated the use of
advanced methodologies for kidney disease prediction and
diagnosis. G. CHEN et al. (2020) utilized an Adaptive Hy-
bridized Deep Convolutional Neural Network (AHDCNN)
integrated with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for
early detection of chronic kidney disease. This approach
achieved high precision and recall ratios, with an F1-score
indicating balanced performance, and demonstrated 80%
successful segmentation of kidneys using data from the
DeepLesion database. The IoMT implementation allowed
for remote tracking and monitoring of patients, transform-
ing medical supervision into telemedicine [125]. Similarly,
M. U. Nasir et al. (2022) developed a deep learning frame-
work employing transfer learning techniques and optimiza-
tion algorithms (SGDM, ADAM, RMSPROP) combined
with IoMT and blockchain for early kidney cancer predic-
tion. Their model attained a training accuracy of 99.8% and
prediction accuracy of 99.20%, leveraging data augmenta-
tion and transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy
and reduce misclassification rates. The dataset included
3300 augmented samples across three grades, with IoMT
and blockchain enhancing data quality and security [126].
In another study, K. Kumar et al. (2023) focused on a
hybrid fuzzy deep neural network (FDNN) for early-stage
prediction of chronic kidney disease, integrating fuzzy
inference systems with neural networks. This Hybrid Fuzzy
Neural Network (HFNN) demonstrated superior accuracy
(99.23%) compared to existing methods (97.46%), partic-
ularly in managing CKD comorbidities and focusing on
hypertension values. The dataset consisted of 5617 records
from Changhua Christian Hospital, utilizing cameras as
sensor for patient images for disease detection [127]. Mean-
while, D. M. Alsekait et al. (2023) proposed a two-level
prediction model using pretrained models (RNN, GRU,
LSTM) in Level 1 and a metalearner (SVM) in Level 2
for stacking ensemble techniques. This model used the
Chronic Kidney Disease dataset from the UCI machine
learning repository, containing 400 cases with various fea-
tures, and employed feature selection and preprocessing
methods like chi-square test, recursive feature elimination,
and handling of missing values to improve the prediction
model. The RNN Layer2 achieved the highest performance
metrics, with the proposed model’s Layer2 also demon-
strating high performance [128].
3.3.2. Alzheimer’s and stroke Prediction
In predicting diseases such as Alzheimer’s and stroke,
models like LSTM RNNs and deep neural networks, em-
ploying techniques such as dropout, regularization, and
optimization algorithms like Adam have achieved high
accuracies in predicting the diseases, utilizing datasets
from national health surveys and ensuring real-time data
processing and enhances the reliability of medical prog-
nostics. T. Wang et al. ( 2018) in Alzheimer’s disease
prediction utilizing dataset from the National Alzheimer’s
Coordinating Center (NACC), involving 5432 patients in
a two-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent
neural network (RNN) with 100 hidden units per layer was
utilized. Techniques included learning rate decay, mov-
ing average decay, L2 regularization, and the Adam Op-
timizer. Data preprocessing involved mean, median, and
mode imputation, normalization, and encoding. Key fea-
tures were Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Geriatric De-
pression Scale (GDS), and Functional Activities Question-
naire (FAQ), achieving superior performance metrics of
Accuracy: 0.9906 ± 0.0043; PPIA: 0.9894 ± 0.0074; SPIA:
0.9912 ± 0.0039 [129]. Dua et al. (2020) explored the
use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) models. Each model underwent Bagging to re-
duce variance, and the Bagged models were then com-
bined using a weighted average ensemble technique. This
approach led to individual model accuracies of 89.75%,
with the ensemble model achieving an impressive accuracy
of 92.22%. The datasets used were OASIS-1, containing
cross-sectional MRI data of 416 subjects, and OASIS-
2, which includes longitudinal MRI data of 150 subjects
[68]. Similarly, Jungyoon Kim and Jihye Lim (2021) used
dataset from from the Korea National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (KNHANES), with 7031 participants
aged over 65 to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model
with four hidden layers (30 neurons each) for dementia
prediction using ReLU activation for hidden layers and
a sigmoid function for the output. Techniques included
0.4 dropout probability, Adam optimization, binary cross-
entropy, and a learning rate of 0.001. Scaled Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) was used for data preprocess-
ing, achieving Performance metrics of AUC: 85.5%, Re-
call: 68.6%, Specificity: 82.1%, Precision: 5.%, Accuracy:
81.9% [130].
Building on these techniques, Y-A Choi et al. (2021)
utilized various deep learning models (LSTM, Bidirec-
tional LSTM, CNN-LSTM, CNN-Bidirectional LSTM) for
stroke prediction using on real-time EEG sensor data vali-
dated using five-fold cross-validation.The CNN-Bidirectional
LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy (94.0%), pre-
cision (94.6%), and F1-score (94.1%) [131]. Chui et al.
(2022) adopted a novel approach by enhancing CNN
models through transfer learning to incorporate domain
knowledge from diverse datasets, and using a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate additional data
for minority classes. This combination improved the de-
tection model’s accuracy by 2.85–3.88%, 2.43–2.66%, and
1.8–40.1% in different scenarios. They utilized the OASIS-
1, OASIS-2, and OASIS-3 datasets, which included 416,
150, and 1098 participants respectively, and covered a
wide range of classes from Normal to Moderate AD [70].
Odusanmi et al. (2023) employed a multimodal fusion-
based approach using discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
to analyze data, optimized through transfer learning with
a pre-trained neural network (VGG16). The final fused
image was reconstructed using inverse discrete wavelet
transform (IDWT). This method achieved an accuracy of

A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
81.25% for AD/EMCI and AD/LMCI in MRI test data,
and 93.75% for AD/EMCI and AD/LMCI in PET test
data. Their study utilized sMRI and FDG-PET images
from the ADNI database, focusing on participants aged
60 to 70 years from the ADNI2 baseline cohort, including
approximately 50 early EMCI and 50 LMCI participants
[65].
On Stroke Prediction, Elbagoury et al. (2023 present
a GMDH-type polynomial network with linear activation
functions, achieving a training error of 0.001 and operating
within a mobile AI smart hospital platform. The model,
leveraging feature scaling techniques for data preprocess-
ing and GMDP deep learning models for feature extraction
from EMG signals, demonstrates high accuracy (96.85%)
in predicting EMG signals. The study utilizes datasets
including the EMG Lower Limb Dataset and mHealth
Dataset, integrating IoMT technology for real-time anal-
ysis and prediction of heart and stroke conditions, thereby
showcasing advanced AI applications in healthcare [132].
3.3.3. COPD, Lung, Liver and Pancreatic Disease
Prediction
In a study by C.T. Wu et al. (2021), researchers de-
veloped a deep neural network (DNN) to predict acute
exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder
(AECOPD), achieving over 90% accuracy. The DNN used
45 features including physiological, environmental, and
lifestyle data from training dataset consisted of 5600 data
points. Evaluation metrics on a test dataset showed high
performance with an F1 score of 0.9323, precision of
0.9393, specificity of 0.9253, sensitivity of 0.9452, AU-
ROC of 0.9699, and accuracy of 0.9357. (IoMT) devices
such as wearables and home sensors are used for automated
data input. To ensure privacy, the system used HTTPS
and encryption protocols, restricting data access to verified
medical providers, thus maintaining confidentiality and
integrity [133]. Conversely, the study by S. L. Jany Shabu
et Al. (2023) employs a deep neural network with residual
connections and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS) for lung cancer detection and prediction, utilizing
the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The deep neural
network includes padding, pooling, dropout, convolution
layers, 16 residual units, and two fully connected layers
to enhance efficiency and performance. ANFIS combines
fuzzy systems’ learning skills with neural networks’ cogni-
tive abilities, improving prediction accuracy and resource
utilization. The FES-LC model achieves an accuracy of
94.2% in lung cancer detection and prediction, with a
mean absolute error ranging from 52.3% to 62.12% across
iterations. It recommends using the FES-LC alongside
simulations and the MNP approach for accurate lung cancer
detection. The dataset used is a privately sourced balanced
lung tumor dataset [134].
Similarly, the study by T.A. Khan et al. (2023) focused
on Google Net Transfer Learning (TL) model applied in
private edge clouds for lung cancer disease prediction,
trained on a dataset of 25,000 images of lung and colon
cancer tissues. The performance of the model was mea-
sured using accuracy, misclassification rate, precision, re-
call, specificity, and F1-score, achieving a high accuracy
of 98.8%, thereby outperforming previous methodologies.
The TL approach was enhanced through data collected
from IoMT devices in hospitals, aiming to improve pre-
diction accuracy while preserving patient privacy in smart
healthcare 5.0 environments. Additionally, the model in-
corporated a Federated Learning (FL) approach to ensure
data privacy, where data was collected from multiple hos-
pitals and transferred to a central database securely using
IoMT devices [135]. Hefu Xie et al. (2024) proposed model
integrates a fully connected neural network for basic patient
features and a convolutional neural network for capturing
temporal patterns in patient data. The combination allows
automatic learning of complex patterns and abstract fea-
tures in highly dynamic medical data associated with acute
liver failure (ALF). This deep learning model integrates
fully connected and convolutional neural networks, out-
performing traditional machine learning methods such as
Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Decision
Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting
in terms of accuracy and generalization, achieving 94.8%
accuracy. The dataset includes diverse patient indicators
like age, gender, weight, obesity status, blood pressure,
cholesterol levels, hepatitis status, and family history of
hepatitis [136].
For pancreatic disease, Asaturyan et al. (2019) em-
ployed a methodology using 3D techniques on MRI and
CT scans for pancreatic segmentation. Their approach in-
volves three main steps: enhancing the pancreas region,
applying 3D segmentation using max-flow and edge de-
tection techniques, and removing non-pancreatic contours.
The model achieved a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient
(DSC) of 79.3 ± 4.4%. They evaluated their method on
two MRI datasets containing 216 and 132 image volumes,
achieving mean DSCs of 79.6 ± 5.7% and 81.6 ± 5.1%,
respectively. Additionally, they used a dataset containing
82 CT image volumes for their analysis [79]. Hu et al.
(2021) introduced the DSD-ASPP-Net architecture, which
integrates DenseASPP with saliency-aware modules for
automatic pancreas segmentation. This advanced architec-
ture achieved an average Dice-Sørensen Coefficient (DSC)
of 85.49 ± 4.77%, surpassing the performance of previous
methods. They evaluated their approach on the public NIH
pancreas dataset and a local hospital dataset, demonstrating
its robustness and effectiveness in clinical settings [80].
3.3.4. Multiple Disease Prediction
Just as machine learning models can be trained on
datasets to predict multiple diseases, deep learning models
can perform even better due to their advanced capabil-
ities in handling complex data, extracting intricate fea-
tures, and improving accuracy in disease prediction and
diagnosis.Researchers have developed sophisticated mod-
els combining deep learning techniques, such as convo-
lutional neural networks and ensemble learning, with IoT

frameworks to improve accuracy and efficiencyleveraging
synthetic data generation, optimization algorithms, and se-
cure data handling to predict various conditions, including
heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer’s,etc. In this
study of S. Thandapani et al. (2023), a pandemic support
system was developed utilizing various deep convolutional
network architectures, including ResNet (50, 100, 101)
and VGG (16, 19) to train datasets comprised CT and X-
ray images from diverse sources like Kaggle, GitHub, and
hospitals, enhanced by generating synthetic data using the
Keras image data generator. To address individual model
bias, a major voting classifier was employed, aggregating
the results from multiple models to improve classification
accuracy. ResNet 101 and VGG 19 achieved the highest
accuracies for CT and X-ray images, respectively. The
system’s IoMT implementation integrated sensors attached
to patients, allowing real-time monitoring via the internet
and cloud technology [137]. A. S. Prakaash et al. (2022)
presented a multi-disease prediction model leveraging en-
semble learning with weighted RBM features, combin-
ing classifiers such as DNN, SVM, and RNN. The ASR-
CHIO algorithm was employed to optimize parameters,
significantly enhancing prediction accuracy. The model
outperformed traditional algorithms, achieving high F1-
scores, MCC, specificity, and NPV. Datasets from vari-
ous sources, including Kaggle and UCI, covering diseases
like COVID-19, EEG Eye State, Epileptic Seizure, Stroke
Prediction, Heart, and Diabetic Retinopathy, were utilized.
The advanced optimization techniques employed ensured
the model’s robustness and efficiency in predicting multiple
diseases accurately [138].
N. Nigar et al. (2023) focused on diagnosing chronic
diseases such as COVID-19, pneumonia, diabetes, heart
disease, brain tumors, and Alzheimer’s using five pre-
trained deep CNN models: VGG16, VGG19, ResNet,
DenseNet, and Inception-v3. These models were trained
with hyperparameter optimization and the XGBoost al-
gorithm, with data preprocessing and augmentation en-
hancing their performance. Evaluations based on accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score demonstrated varied success
rates across different diseases. The study utilized real-time
datasets from Kaggle and other sources and implemented
an IoMT framework to connect medical devices and sen-
sors, employing enhanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography
(ECC) to ensure patient data privacy [26]. M. K. Chowdary
et al. (2023) utilized a combination of machine learn-
ing algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient
Boosting, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM, KNN)
and deep learning (VGG19 CNN) to predict diseases like
heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, liver disease, kidney
disease, malaria, and pneumonia. The model demonstrated
high accuracy for various diseases, with SVM, Random
Forest, and VGG19 showing exceptional performance met-
rics. Datasets from sources like Kaggle, NIH, and medical
centers were employed, highlighting the algorithms’ po-
tential in predicting multiple diseases with high precision
and reliability. Techniques like ROC analysis were used
to evaluate performance, showcasing the robustness of the
model [139].
Anusha Ampavathi and T. Vijaya Saradhi (2021) de-
veloped a hybrid deep learning model using the JA-MVO-
RNN + DBN algorithm, implemented in MATLAB, for
predicting multiple diseases, including diabetes, hepatitis,
lung cancer, liver tumor, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and
heart disease. The predictive models demonstrate high
performance with the following highest figures: Diabetes:
Precision 0.97753, MCC 0.93528; Hepatitis: Precision
0.98684, MCC 0.84824; Lung cancer: Precision 0.97297,
MCC 0.81523; Liver tumor: Precision 0.97753, MCC
0.93528; Alzheimer’s disease: Precision 1.0, MCC 0.94403
[140].
R. Daid et al. (2021) employed a deep learning-based
multi-layer convolution neural network using TensorFlow
and Keras for the early detection of diseases such as heart
disease, stroke, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and depres-
sion. The methodology included data preprocessing, nor-
malization, and augmentation. The model achieved high
accuracy and precision across different training and test
splits. The dataset comprised chronic symptoms, illness
severity, diagnosis information, and environmental factors
from 600,000 patients, providing a comprehensive basis for
robust predictive modeling [56].
Table 8 summarizes thirty-three studies that apply var-
ious deep learning (DL) techniques, including VGG19
CNN, NN, RNN, DBN, LSTM, GoogleNet, VGG16 CNN,
ResNet, and Inception, to predict and analyze chronic dis-
eases. Each study is categorized by disease type and ML
model used, with reported performance metrics such as Ac-
curacy, Sensitivity, Specificity, ROC AUC, and F1-score.
Dataset descriptions encompass diverse sources from med-
ical imaging to clinical records. Notably, integration with
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) data and stringent data
privacy measures are highlighted across studies to protect
patient information.
3.4. Comparative Analysis of Technologies Used
Across Different Disease Types
Significant advancements in cardiovascular, chronic
kidney, and Alzheimer’s predictions underscore the ef-
fectiveness of ML and DL models. Yet, diseases like
COPD, dementia, stroke, and certain cancers remain un-
derexplored, signaling critical areas for future research,
especially in understanding disease comorbidities.
3.4.1. Heart Disease Prediction
Heart disease remains a leading cause of global mortal-
ity, underscoring the critical importance of early detection
and treatment. Machine learning (ML) models, such as
XGBoost, and deep learning (DL) models, like EDCNN,
have proven highly effective in predicting heart disease.
XGBoost stands out for its exceptional accuracy and pre-
cision in cardiovascular studies. Its strength lies in its
ability to handle large, complex datasets with numerous

A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
features, manage missing data effectively, and avoid over-
fitting—common challenges in medical data analysis.
On the other hand, EDCNN and Faster R-CNN com-
bined with SE-ResNet-101 demonstrate high precision in
image-based predictions. These deep learning frameworks
excel at extracting intricate patterns from imaging data,
which is vital in cardiology for detailed visualization. For
instance, XGBoost models (A. Ogunpola et al., 2024)
achieve impressive F1 scores of 98.71%, highlighting their
robustness in managing cardiovascular data complexities
[96]. Similarly, deep learning models such as HLDA-
MALO, integrated with Faster R-CNN (S. Manimurugan
et al., 2022), achieve even higher precision, with F1 scores
reaching up to 99.02%, reflecting their advanced feature
extraction capabilities [120].
3.4.2. Chronic and End-Stage Kidney Disease
Kidney diseases, particularly chronic and end-stage
renal disease, require continual monitoring and early pre-
diction to prevent progression and manage treatments ef-
fectively. DL Models like Stacking Ensemble (involving
RNN, LSTM, GRU, and SVM) excel due to their ability
to learn temporal dependencies and complex patterns in
patient data over time, which is crucial for monitoring kid-
ney function and disease progression. Probabilistic Neural
Networks (PNN) have shown promising results, particu-
larly in early stages of kidney diseases. PNNs are adept at
classifying complex patterns and are beneficial in settings
where diagnosis is based on a clear set of measurable
stages. Advanced DL ensembles (D. M. Alsekait et al.,
2023) report near-perfect metrics (99.69% across accuracy,
precision, recall, F1 score), highlighting their potential in
precise renal function analysis [128].
3.4.3. Alzheimer’s, Dementia and Stroke Prediction
Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia pose
significant challenges due to their progressive nature and
the subtle onset of symptoms. The Random Forest (RF)
algorithm has proven effective in predicting Alzheimer’s,
largely because of its ensemble approach, which adeptly
handles diverse data types and is resilient to overfitting—a
common issue with the heterogeneous and noisy datasets
typical in Alzheimer’s research. RF has demonstrated
impressive accuracy in Alzheimer’s prediction, achieving
98.81% as reported by S. Jahan et al. (2023) [71]. However,
models for dementia exhibit greater variability, highlight-
ing the need for more targeted model development.
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) combined with scaled
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) offer a sophisticated
approach to dementia prediction by leveraging dimension-
ality reduction to emphasize the most pertinent features.
This method addresses the complex, multifactorial nature
of dementia and has achieved an accuracy of 81.9%, as
detailed by Jungyoon Kim and Jihye Lim (2021) [130].
Furthermore, hybrid architectures like the Stacked
CNN and Residual Feedback GMDH-LSTM models, used
in stroke prediction, illustrate the potential of combining
different model types to enhance predictive performance.
These hybrid models demonstrate deep learning’s ability to
manage acute medical events with high accuracy, achieving
99% accuracy according to Elbagoury et al. (2023) [132].
3.4.4. COPD and Lung Cancer
Both diseases benefit significantly from advanced imag-
ing techniques, which are enhanced by DL models capable
of detailed image analysis. Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
show substantial efficacy in diagnosing COPD by analyz-
ing complex patterns in pulmonary imaging data, which
often includes subtle signs that precede clinical symptoms.
IoMT-enabled GoogleNet with transfer learning offers a
cutting-edge approach for lung cancer prediction, com-
bining the strengths of deep learning with real-time data
acquisition capabilities of IoMT devices. Recent models
demonstrate significant advancements, with DNNs achiev-
ing over 92% accuracy in COPD prediction (C.T. Wu et
al., 2021) [133] and hybrid models reaching up to 98.8% in
lung cancer diagnostics (T. A. Khan et al. 2023) [135].
3.4.5. Pancreatitis and Liver Disease Prediction
Acute conditions like pancreatitis and liver diseases
require rapid and accurate prediction to enhance treatment
outcomes. XGBoost excels in feature extraction, helping
identify the most relevant features from the dataset, a
crucial capability for acute pancreatitis prediction as it en-
hances prediction accuracy. Additionally, XGBoost’s scal-
able nature makes it efficient with large datasets, using gra-
dient boosting to build trees sequentially, which is effective
for handling complex datasets and missing values. Study
by (Zhou et al.,2022) [110] demonstrated XGBoost’s high
performance, achieving an AUC of 0.906.
Li et al. (2018) and Xie et al. (2024) rely on the
strength of Hybrid models in combining advantages of the
combining models. Li et al. (2018) utilized a hybrid model
that integrates Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HFB),
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)
leveraging the strengths of each method and achieved ac-
curacy of 96.47%, sensibility of 95.23% and specificity of
97.51% [77]. Hybrid deep learning models, which combine
fully connected neural networks (FCNs) with convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), as proposed by (Xie et al. 2024),
are highly effective at extracting both basic and complex
features from medical data. These hybrid models can han-
dle large and diverse datasets efficiently by leveraging the
strengths of CNNs for spatial data and FCNs for more
abstract feature extraction, making them suitable for large-
scale medical data, demonstrating superior generalization
capabilities, reaching an impressive accuracy of 94.8%.
[136].
3.4.6. Multiple Disease Prediction
Selecting the right model is crucial for predicting mul-
tiple diseases, especially with diverse datasets and chal-
lenges in feature extraction, dataset management, perfor-

those by (N. Nigar et al., 2023) and (R. Daid et al., 2021)
are most effective for comorbidity prediction.
N. Nigar et al. (2023) advanced chronic disease diag-
nosis by combining five pretrained deep CNNs-VGG16,
VGG19, ResNet, DenseNet, and Inception-v3. These mod-
els excel in feature extraction due to prior large-scale
dataset training, discerning complex medical data patterns.
Hyperparameter optimization and the XGBoost algorithm
further enhance performance and accuracy. Data prepro-
cessing, augmentation, and real-time datasets from Kaggle,
integrated with the IoMT framework, ensure high perfor-
mance and generalizability. However, success rates vary
across diseases, indicating a need for additional fine-tuning
for consistent results [26].
Similarly, R. Daid et al. (2021) demonstrated excep-
tional performance with a deep learning-based CNN model
trained on a dataset of 600,000 patients. This model ef-
fectively handles large data volumes and captures intri-
cate disease patterns through hierarchical feature extrac-
tion, ensuring high predictive accuracy and generalizability
across diseases. The model integrates various data types,
including symptoms and environmental factors, for accu-
rate predictions. Its performance, however, could be influ-
enced by dataset representativeness and balance, requiring
adaptability to diverse demographics and evolving medical
conditions to maintain high performance [56].

4. Discussion
Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed
medical diagnostics, offering unprecedented capabilities in
the prediction and management of chronic and terminal
diseases. By utilizing diverse and comprehensive datasets,
AI models have improved in accuracy and generalizabil-
ity, influencing clinical decision-making processes across
various medical fields.
Dataset Challenges and Variability: The utilization
of comprehensive datasets from reputable sources like
the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC),
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) enables
AI models to generalize across diverse populations and
clinical conditions. However, the diversity and heterogene-
ity in these datasets present significant challenges:
1. Data Quality and Consistency: Differences in data
collection protocols, patient demographics, and measure-
ment standards can lead to variations in data quality. These
inconsistencies can adversely affect model performance,
resulting in unreliable outputs and compromised repro-
ducibility across different healthcare settings. Incomplete

or noisy data can further skew model training, potentially
leading to biased predictions. Advanced data harmoniza-
tion techniques, such as transfer learning and domain adap-
tation, are increasingly important. These methods help
adapt models developed in one domain to perform effec-
tively in another, thereby reducing performance degrada-
tion when applied to new data. Data imputation algorithms
are also crucial for addressing issues related to missing
data, ensuring that models are trained on comprehensive
and representative datasets.
2. Overfitting Risks: Models trained in controlled en-
vironments with clean and curated data may exhibit high
accuracy but often fail to replicate these results in real-
world scenarios. This discrepancy, known as overfitting,
occurs when models learn patterns specific to the training
data, including noise, rather than generalizable features.
To mitigate overfitting, robust validation frameworks are
necessary. Techniques like k-fold cross-validation, adver-
sarial validation, L1 and L2 regularization, dropout layers
in neural networks, and early stopping during training
can help prevent models from becoming overly complex

and narrowly tailored to the training data. Computational
Complexity and Efficiency While encryption and other se-
curity measures are essential for protecting sensitive patient
data, they introduce additional computational overhead.
For instance, encryption in models, such as Single-Layer
Perceptrons for heart disease prediction, can significantly
increase computational demands. This added complex-
ity can hinder the scalability of AI solutions and limit
their deployment in real-time clinical settings, where quick
decision-making is essential. To address this, homomor-
phic encryption can be utilized, allowing computations
on encrypted data without decrypting it, thus preserving
privacy while enabling robust data analytics. Addition-
ally, lightweight cryptographic algorithms are beneficial
in environments with limited processing power, such as
SecureIoMT (Internet of Medical Things) devices, which
collect and transmit sensitive health data.
Model Complexity and Deployment Challenges: Ad-
vanced models, like the two-stage architecture used by
Manimurugan et al. for heart disease prediction, achieve
high accuracy through sophisticated techniques. However,
their complexity often requires substantial computational
resources and expertise, which may not be available in all
clinical settings. The complexity of these models can also
make them difficult to interpret, posing challenges for in-
tegration into clinical workflows and decision-making pro-
cesses. To overcome these challenges, model simplification
and knowledge distillation techniques can be employed,
where simpler, more efficient models learn to replicate the
performance of larger, more complex models. Additionally,
edge computing offers a practical solution by processing
data locally on SecureIoMT devices, reducing the need
to transmit large volumes of sensitive data to centralized
servers and enabling faster, real-time decision-making.
Data Security in Diverse Environments: Implement-
ing robust security measures across varied healthcare sys-
tems is crucial for protecting patient data. The use of end-
to-end encryption, zero trust architectures, and multi-factor
authentication can significantly enhance data security.
These measures ensure that data is protected from unau-
thorized access at all points, especially in environments
utilizing SecureIoMT devices. Behavioral biometrics can
further enhance security, ensuring that only authorized
personnel can access critical data. However, these security
systems require significant infrastructure and maintenance,
which can be challenging to implement uniformly across
diverse healthcare settings. The diversity in healthcare
environments, from advanced to resource-limited, adds
complexity to the deployment of standardized security
measures, potentially hindering the widespread adoption
of AI technologies.
Mitigating Limitations for Broader Application: To
ensure broader and more effective application of AI in
healthcare, several strategies can be adopted:
1. Enhancing Data Interoperability: Improving the in-
teroperability and integration of data from various sources,
including SecureIoMT devices, is essential. These devices
generate vast amounts of real-time data, necessitating so-
phisticated systems for efficient data management. Stan-
dards for data formatting and communication protocols are
crucial for seamless data integration into AI models.
2. Improving Generalizability and Reliability: To com-
bat overfitting and enhance model reliability, techniques
such as cross-validation, robust regularization, and en-
semble learning are important. These approaches ensure
that models are accurate and applicable in diverse clinical
environments, improving their robustness.
3. Standardizing Data Privacy Techniques: Consistent
implementation of advanced data privacy methods, such as
blockchain and differential privacy, is critical. These tech-
niques protect patient data while ensuring compliance with
regulations and maintaining trust. Standardization across
healthcare systems facilitates data sharing and collabora-
tion, enhancing the utility and reliability of AI models.
In conclusion, while AI holds promise in improving
medical diagnostics through enhanced prediction capa-
bilities, significant challenges such as dataset variability,
overfitting and technical complexities must be addressed
to ensure broader and more reliable application in clinical
practice. Efforts to mitigate these limitations are crucial
for advancing the effectiveness and scalability of AI-driven
healthcare solutions.
5. Gaps in the Literature
Data Quality and Generalizability: AI models rely
heavily on diverse datasets for training and validation.
A.T Otapo et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier
Page 18 of 37
A.T Otapo et al. Prediction and Detection of Terminal Diseases Using Using Internet of Medical Things: A Review
However, the variability in data quality, patient demo-
graphics, and data formats poses a significant challenge
to the generalizability of these models. This variability
is evident in datasets from different sources, including
hospitals, clinical studies, and research initiatives like
the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
[131, 104, 129, 71]. The inconsistent data quality and
diverse patient profiles can lead to models that perform well
in specific settings but fail to generalize across different
populations and clinical environments.
Complexity of Integrating IoMT Data: The rise of In-
ternet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, such as wearable
health monitors and implantable sensors, introduces new
layers of complexity. These devices continuously generate
vast amounts of real-time patient data, which must be
accurately integrated into AI models. The challenges lie
in ensuring interoperability between different devices and
systems, managing data standards, and handling the high
volume of data effectively. The integration of IoMT data
necessitates sophisticated data management strategies to
ensure seamless incorporation into predictive models and
clinical workflows.
Overfitting and Model Robustness: Overfitting re-
mains a significant issue in the development of AI models
for healthcare. Models often achieve high accuracy in con-
trolled, curated environments but struggle to maintain per-
formance when applied to new, unseen data in real-world
clinical settings [96, 98]. This gap highlights the need
for robust model validation techniques and approaches to
ensure that AI predictions are reliable and applicable in
diverse clinical scenarios.
Addressing Multi-Morbidity Scenarios: While AI mod-
els have seen substantial development in predicting and
diagnosing common diseases like cardiovascular disease
and chronic kidney disease, there is a notable lack of focus
on multi-morbidity scenarios, especially those involving
rare and critical diseases such as dementia, stroke, and
various cancers. These conditions often interact with other
chronic illnesses, complicating diagnosis and treatment.
The development of AI models that can effectively account
for these interactions and provide accurate predictions in
complex clinical scenarios remains underexplored and is
critically needed.
Standardization and Optimization of Data Privacy
Techniques: The protection of sensitive patient data is
paramount, particularly in the context of AI-driven health-
care solutions that often rely on cloud-based infrastruc-
tures. However, there is an inconsistent implementation of
advanced data privacy techniques such as federated learn-
ing, blockchain, encryption, and differential privacy across
healthcare systems. This inconsistency leads to variations
in data protection standards and computational efficiency.
The integration of IoMT devices further complicates the
scenario, as these devices continuously collect sensitive
patient data. Ensuring robust security measures, including
secure transmission protocols and endpoint security, is es-
sential to prevent unauthorized access and maintain patient
confidentiality. By addressing these challenges comprehen-
sively, healthcare systems can enhance trust in AI-driven
technologies while safeguarding patient data integrity and
regulatory compliance.
6. Future Research Directions
As the field of predictive modeling in healthcare contin-
ues to evolve, several key areas present promising opportu-
nities for advancement. Addressing these areas can signif-
icantly enhance the efficacy and applicability of predictive
models in clinical settings. Future research should focus on
the following directions:
1. Exploration of Multi-Disease Models: There is a
significant opportunity to develop predictive models that
can address multiple diseases concurrently, particularly
in environments characterized by prevalent comorbidities.
This includes focusing on multi-morbidity scenarios, such
as the interaction between rare and critical diseases like de-
mentia, stroke, and various cancers, and their intersection
with chronic illnesses.
2. Enhancement of Data Interoperability: Effective pre-
dictive models rely on the quality and integration of data
from diverse sources. To address this, advanced data pre-
processing techniques are essential. This includes imple-
menting robust protocols for data cleaning, transformation,
and harmonization to standardize data formats and quality,
especially when integrating data from the Internet of Med-
ical Things (IoMT) devices.
3. Focus on Model Explainability: As predictive mod-
els grow in complexity, maintaining their interpretability
for practitioners becomes crucial. Research should aim at
developing methods to make these sophisticated models
more understandable, thereby bridging the gap between
technical efficacy and clinical usability. This includes ad-
dressing overfitting and generalizability challenges by em-
ploying techniques like transfer learning and ensemble
methods, which can improve model performance across
various data sources, including those generated by IoMT
devices.
4. Integration of Advanced Data Privacy Techniques:
Standardizing the implementation of advanced techniques
such as federated learning, blockchain, and differential
privacy is imperative. This can be achieved through the
creation of open-source tools and frameworks to simplify
the integration of these methods into IoMT systems, aiding
in the management of large datasets from diverse devices.
The effort should focus on scaling these techniques to facil-
itate real-time, collaborative analysis across decentralized
networks while ensuring data integrity and transparency.

7. Conclusion
The fusion of machine learning (ML) and deep learning
(DL) with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has
significantly advanced the field of medical diagnostics. ML
algorithms like XGBoost and Random Forest are pivotal in
achieving high accuracy levels, noted at over 98% for dis-
eases such as heart disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD),
Alzheimer’s, and lung cancer. These algorithms excel in
handling structured data, performing well in environments
where large volumes of historical data aid in predictive
analysis.
DL techniques, including Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent
Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs), have shown exceptional
promise in interpreting complex patterns in data, particu-
larly useful in forecasting conditions like stroke and demen-
tia. Their high accuracy, exceeding 99% in some studies, is
largely due to their proficiency in processing sequential and
image data, which is often gathered in real-time from vari-
ous medical sensors integrated within IoMT frameworks.
These breakthroughs leverage cloud-based analytics
and real-time data from medical sensors, enhancing the
ability to predict and diagnose diseases such as kidney and
lung cancer. This integration not only improves the speed
and accuracy of diagnostics but also helps in continuous
patient monitoring, crucial for chronic and terminal disease
management.
Despite these technological advancements, the integra-
tion of AI and IoMT is not without challenges. Variability
in data quality and sources, often compounded by the com-
plexities inherent in IoMT devices, presents significant hur-
dles. These include: (i) Data Management and Integration:
The diversity of data types and sources requires robust data
management and integration systems. Effective handling
of this data is crucial to ensure that the predictive models
are both accurate and scalable across different healthcare
settings; (ii) Overfitting and Generalization: Overfitting
remains a significant challenge, where models trained on
specific datasets perform well in controlled tests but fail to
generalize to broader, real-world applications. This issue is
particularly pronounced in the context of multi-morbidity
scenarios and rare diseases, where data can be sparse and
highly specific; (iii) Navigating Multi-Morbidity Scenar-
ios: Diseases often do not occur in isolation. The ability
to predict and diagnose multiple conditions simultane-
ously, or to understand how one disease may influence the
progression of another, is still an area needing extensive
research and innovative modeling approaches.
Ensuring the privacy and security of patient data is
paramount. With the increasing use of IoMT devices that
continuously collect patient data, establishing standardized
and optimized privacy measures is critical to maintaining
patient trust and ensuring compliance with stringent health-
care regulations. The challenges include: (i) Standardiza-
tion Across Platforms: Uniform data privacy standards that
can be implemented across various platforms and devices
are essential. This standardization helps in safeguarding
data integrity and ensuring seamless interoperability be-
tween different systems; (ii) Optimized Data Privacy Mea-
sures: Employing advanced techniques such as federated
learning, blockchain technology, and differential privacy
can help in enhancing the security and privacy of patient
data, minimizing the risk of breaches while maintaining the
utility of the data for medical analysis.
The graphical abstract depicted on the first page of
our review paper highlights essential elements, including
dataset availability, privacy protocols, and the use of ma-
chine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models such
as XGBoost, CNNs, and LSTM networks for predicting
conditions like heart disease, CKD, Alzheimer’s, and lung
cancer. It explores the integration of diverse datasets from
platforms like Kaggle, UCI, private institutions, and IoMT
sources. The figure also addresses issues related to data
interoperability, model generalization, and the necessity
for advanced methods like transfer learning and ensemble
techniques, while emphasizing the need for strong privacy
and security measures for IoMT systems. Additionally, it
outlines future research directions, provides an analysis of
each section, identifies existing gaps, and proposes future
directions.
