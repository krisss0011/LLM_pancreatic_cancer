Abstract 
 
Automatic melanoma segmentation is essential for early 
skin cancer detection, yet challenges arise from the 
heterogeneity of melanoma, as well as interfering factors 
like blurred boundaries, low contrast, and imaging 
artifacts. While numerous algorithms have been developed 
to address these issues, previous approaches have often 
overlooked the need to jointly capture spatial and 
sequential features within dermatological images. This 
limitation hampers segmentation accuracy, especially in 
cases with indistinct borders or structurally similar lesions. 
Additionally, previous models lacked both a global 
receptive field and high computational efficiency. In this 
work, we present the XLSTM-VMUNet Model, which 
jointly capture spatial and sequential features within 
derma-tological images successfully. XLSTM-VMUNet 
can not only specialize in extracting spatial features from 
images, focusing on the structural characteristics of skin 
lesions, but also enhance contextual understanding, 
allowing more effective handling of complex medical 
image structures. Experiment results on the ISIC2018 
dataset demonstrate that XLSTM-VMUNet outperforms 
VMUNet by 1.25% on DSC and 2.07% on IoU, with faster 
convergence and consistently high segmentation perfor-
mance. Our code of XLSTM-VMUNet is available at 
https://github.com/FangZhuoyi/XLSTM-VMUNet. 
1. Introduction 
As the largest organ in the human body, the skin acts as 
the primary barrier against ultraviolet radiation, safe-
guarding the body from its detrimental effects [1]. The 
2023 global cancer statistics indicate that malignant skin 
lesions account for tens of thousands of deaths each year  
[2]. Notably, melanoma, a highly aggressive type of skin 
cancer, is rapidly becoming one of the fastest-increasing 
cancers around the world [3,4,5,6,7]. Segmentation plays a 
vital and challenging role in the workflow for automated 
skin lesion analysis [8]. In recent years, a large number of 
computer-assisted segmentation techniques have been 
developed for medical images. However, segmenting 
medical image automatically and accuratelly is a literally 
challenging task because these images are inherently 
complex and rarely contain simple linear features [9]. Over 
the past decade, numerous studies have focused on the 
develop-ment of efficient and robust segmentation 
methods for medical imaging. Among these contributions, 
U-Net [10,11,12] stands out as a seminal work that first 
illustrated the efficacy of encoder-decoder convolutional 
networks with skip connections for medical image 
segmentation, and it has also yielded promising outcomes 
in various image translation tasks. Since the inception of 
U-Net [16], a number of significant modifications have 
emerged [13,14,15], particularly within the domain of 
medical imaging, including variants such as U-Net++ [17], 
3D U-Net [18], V-Net [19], and Ynet [20]. Additionally, 
UneXt  [21], Rolling-UNet [22], HEA-Net [23] and U-
MLP [24] incorporate hybrid methodologies that combine 
convolu-tional operations with multi-layer perceptrons 
(MLP) to enhance the performance of segmentation 
networks, thereby facilitating their application in resource-
limited point-of-care settings. Recently, a variety of 
networks leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNN) [25,26,27,28,29] and Vision Transformers (ViT)  
[30] have been employed to augment the U-Net archi-
tecture for medical image segmentation. These networks 
have proven effective in addressing global context and 
long-range dependencies within the segmentation tasks. In 
comparison to CNN, ViT typically exhibits enhanced 
learning capabi-lities on large-scale medical image seg-
mentation datasets [31], attributed to its incorporation of 
the self-attention mechanism [32,33,34]. However, the 
quadratic complexity associated with the self-attention 
mechanism, coupled with the substantial number of tokens, 
results in significant computational overhead when applied 
to large-scale skin lesion image segmentation tasks that 
involve high spatial resolutions [35,36,37,38]. The unre-
solved trade-off bet-ween achieving a global receptive 
field and maintaining high computational efficiency drives 
the need for a novel architecture tailored for large-scale 
skin lesion image segmentation, which aims to retain the 
intrinsic benefits of the standard self-attention mechanism, 
including global receptive fields and dynamic weighting 
parameters. 
State Space Models (SSM) [39,40,41,42] have attracted 
significant interest owing to their computational efficiency  
Mamba [43], a novel SSM within the realm of natural 
 
When Mamba Meets xLSTM: An Efficient and Precise Method with the XLSTM-
VMUNet Model for Skin lesion Segmentation

language processing (NLP) [44,45], has emerged as a 
highly promising method for modeling long sequences 
with linear complexity [46]. Due to its advantages over 
conventional foundational architectures, Mamba holds 
significant potential as a visual foundational architecture 
[47,48]. It has been actively utilized across various 
computer vision tasks [49], contributing notably to the field 
of medical image segmentation [50]. Inspired by Mamba, 
Vision Mamba [51] and Visual Mamba [52] were the 
pioneering implementations of this model in the visual 
domain, achieving very impressive results. Furthermore, 
several researchers have adapted it for medical image 
segmentation, resulting in innovations such as VM-Unet 
[53], U-Mamba [54], H-vmunet [55], Swin-Umamba [56], 
nnMamba [57], Mamba-UNet [58], LightM-Unet [59] and 
UltraLight-VM-UNet [60]. Particularly, SkinMamba [61] 
facilitates expert knowledge exchange across different 
levels in a global state and achieves high-frequency 
restoration and boundary prior guidance. 
However, the challenges remaining in skin lesion 
segmentation have not been solved completely. For 
instance, existing models exhibit limitations in simul-
taneously capturing spatial and sequential features, which 
hampers their ability to comprehensively understand the 
information within skin lesion images. Additionally, these 
models lack contextual understanding, making it 
challenging to establish long-range dependencies when 
processing skin lesion images. Previous methods also 
struggle to achieve precise segmentation in the presence of 
ambiguous boundaries or similar structures, resulting in 
inadequate extraction of detailed spatial features, par-
ticularly in addressing subtle structures and lesion 
boundaries. Furthermore, these methods find it difficult to 
balance global receptive fields with high computational 
efficiency. 
Recently, the Extended Long Short-Term Memory 
(xLSTM) [62] architecture represents a significant advan-
cement in language modeling, demonstrating potential to 
compete with Transformer and State SSM. By optimizing 
the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
[63,64,65,66,67], xLSTM effectively manages long-range 
dependencies while maintaining linear com-putational and 
memory efficiency [68,69]. Similar to models such as ViT 
in the field of computer vision, xLSTM offers a powerful 
alternative in the evolving landscape of medical image 
segmentation [70,71,72]. Vision-LSTM [73] employed a 
generic computer vision backbone that uses xLSTM blocks 
as its core components. xLSTM-UNet [74] proposed the 
xLSTM-enabled U-Net image segmentation network that 
can perform both 2D and 3D medical image segmentation 
tasks and achieves state-of-theart (SOTA) results. 
In this paper, we propose the XLSTM-VMUNet model, 
which combines Mamba with xLSTM for efficient skin 
lesion segmentation. Through a carefully designed archi-
tecture, our model excels in feature extraction, memory 
retention, adaptability, and nonlinear modeling. First, we 
leverage Mamba for deep spatial feature extraction using a 
multi-layer convolutional and pooling network to pro-
gressively capture essential features from skin lesion 
images. The integration of residual connections enhances 
feature transfer efficiency and improves processing 
capability for complex lesion patterns, establishing a 
robust basis for xLSTM. Following feature extraction, we 
input spatial features into xLSTM to utilize its long-term 
and short-term memory mechanisms. xLSTM processes 
sequential data while preserving crucial contextual infor-
mation via a detailed state update mechanism. Specifically, 
we designed gating mechanisms that allow the model to 
selectively retain key features during skin lesion pro-
cessing, maintaining segmentation performance across 
varying lesion types. To boost adaptability, we incor-
porated structured input processing in xLSTM, including a 
BlockDiagonal structure, to address diverse skin lesion 
types. This dynamic feature adjustment enables the model 
to adapt flexibly to the varying characteristics and 
distributions of different lesion categories, a crucial 
capability given the diverse morphology and sizes found in 
skin lesions. Finally, for feature fusion, we implemented a 
multi-level feature integration mechanism, combining 
Mamba-extracted features with xLSTM’s output through 
concatenation and weighted fusion. This strategy enhances 
segmentation accuracy and improves pattern recognition. 
We employed cross-validation during validation to ensure 
stability and reliability across different skin lesion datasets. 
In summary, the following are the major contributions 
of our work: 
 
◆ 
We introduce the XLSTM-VMUNet model, which is 
designed to efficiently extract and integrate both 
spatial features and temporal information within skin 
lesion images. By leveraging the strengths of xLSTM 
in modeling long-range dependencies and temporal 
dynamics, our XLSTM-VMUNet model significant-
ly improves the accuracy and robustness of the se-
gmentation process. 
◆ 
We propose a multi-level feature integration me-
chanism to effectively combine the features extracted 
by Mamba with the processing results of xLSTM. 
The feature linking and weighted fusion ensures that 
feature information at different levels can be fully 
integrated, which significantly improves the accuracy 
of the model for skin lesion seg-mentation and 
enhances the ability of the model to capture complex 
patterns. 
◆ 
We conduct extensive experiments conducted on the 
ISIC2018 skin lesion segmentation dataset, demon-
strating that XLSTM-VMUNet outperforms SOTA 
(state-of-the-art) methods across Dice and IoU 
metrics, with faster convergence and consistently 
high segmentation perfor-mance.

2.1. Medical image segmentation 
Medical images play a pivotal role in aiding healthcare 
providers in diagnosis and treatment decisions [75,76]. 
Interpretation relies on radiologists' expertise, which is 
time-intensive and subjective, influenced by experience 
and training [77]. Therefore, integrating computer-aided 
systems has become crucial to ensure efficient, objective, 
and consistent analysis of medical images [94,95,96]. 
Image segmentation, a key process in medical physics, is 
essential for identifying tumors or lesions by partitioning 
an image into homogeneous regions for extracting 
diagnostic information [97,98,99]. Advanced techniques 
have been developed to address the limitations of 
traditional methods, significantly improving both accuracy 
and efficiency in medical image analysis [80,81,82,100]. 
Since the introduction of U-Net, several variants have 
been proposed to enhance its performance. U-Net++ [17] 
replaces traditional cropping and concatenation with dense 
convolutions, improving feature fusion and reducing 
information loss. Attention-U-Net [102] integrates atten-
tion mechanisms to focus on relevant regions and suppress 
irrelevant information. Res-U-Net [101] introduces resi-
dual blocks to stabilize feature transfer and improve deep 
network training. Dense-U-Net [103,104] employs Dense-
blocks for efficient feature reuse and better multi-scale 
information capture. U-Netv2 [105] uses an innovative 
skip connection mechanism to refine feature fusion and 
improve integration across scales. 
2.2. Mamba 
Mamba, based on the SSM [39], provides a more 
efficient alternative to transformers in medical image 
analysis [40]. With linear time complexity, it processes 
longer sequences faster, reduces memory usage, and excels  
in multimodal data integration, enhancing diagnostic 
accuracy and patient outcomes [41,42].  
Vim (Zhu et al., 2024a) [51] is a Mamba-based archi-
tecture that processes image patch sequences, using 
position embeddings and a class token. The sequence is 
then passed through Vim blocks with both forward and 
backward SSM paths. VMamba (Liu et al., 2024g) [52] 
enhances Mamba’s 1D scanning by introducing the Cross-
Scan Module (CSM), which scans image patches in four  
directions and applies selective SSMs to capture cross-
directional dependencies. The sequences are merged back 
into the original 2D layout. It uses stacked VSS blocks with 
down-sampling, where the vanilla VSS block replaces 1D 
convolution with 2D depthwise convolution and incor-
porates SS2D with layer normalization. PlainMamba 
(Yang et al., 2024a) [83] is a non-hierarchical architecture  
optimized for multi-scale fusion, multi-modal integration, 
and hardware efficiency. It processes 2D patches with 
depthwise convolutions and adapted selective scanning 
using zigzag and direction-aware updates.  
LocalMamba (Huang et al., 2024e) [106] resolves local 
token dependency issues by dividing the image into local 
windows for directional selective scanning (SSM), while 
maintaining global SSM. It also uses spatial and channel 
attention before patch merging and optimizes scan 
directions for each layer to improve efficiency. Efficient-
VMamba (Pei et al., 2024) [107] combines Efficient 2D 
Scanning (ES2D) with atrous sampling and a convolutional 
branch for global and local feature extraction, processed by 
a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block [108]. The output 
forms the EVSS block, with EVSS in early stages and 
Inverted Residual blocks in later stages. 
2.3. xLSTM 
The xLSTM [62] model marks a significant break-
through in the field of sequence modeling, offering a 
powerful alternative to established architectures like 
Transformer and SSM, which have dominated machine 
learning applications in natural language processing and 
computer vision. Building upon traditional Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM) networks [63,64,65,66,67], 
xLSTM introduces key innovations that enable efficient 
capture of long-range dependencies, all while maintaining 
linear computational complexity and memory efficiency. 
This makes xLSTM particularly well-suited for scenarios 
involving large-scale datasets and high-dimensional inputs, 
where conventional RNN models often encounter scal-
ability and performance limitations.  
xLSTM presents a promising alternative to traditional 
convolutional methods in medical image segmentation, a 
field that demands high precision and effective multi-scale 
feature integration. The Vision-LSTM model [73] exem-
plifies this approach by embedding xLSTM blocks into a 
general-purpose computer vision architecture, improving 
the model's ability to capture both spatial and temporal 
dependencies within medical images. This integration 
enhances feature representation, enabling more accurate 
differentiation of subtle patterns, such as tumor structures 
and organ boundaries. 
Furthermore, the xLSTM-UNet architecture [74], which 
integrates xLSTM units with the U-Net framework, has 
demonstrated outstanding performance in both 2D and 3D 
medical image segmentation tasks. By harnessing 
xLSTM's ability to model long-range dependencies, 
xLSTM-UNet enhances the network's capacity to capture 
global contextual information, thereby improving seg-
mentation accuracy, particularly in complex cases with 
intricate anatomical structures or heterogeneous tissue 
types.

3. Method 
Firstly, we introduce selective state space models (S6). 
Then, we describe the VSS block and the xLSTM block. 
Finally, we ascensively elaborate on the core structure: the 
XLSTM-VMUNet Model. 
3.1. SSM 
SSM is a core class of framework in deep learning for 
processing sequential data. These models aim to map an 
input sequence, denoted as 𝑥(𝑡), from a real vector space 
𝑅𝐿 to an output sequence 𝑦(𝑡) within the same space, 
while leveraging an intermediate latent state ℎ(𝑡)  also 
within 𝑅𝑁. The system dynamics are governed b a series of 
linear transformations, as outlined in the corresponding set 
of equations: 
{ℎ′(𝑡) = 𝐴ℎ(𝑡) + 𝐵𝑥(𝑡)
𝑦(𝑡) = 𝐶ℎ(𝑡)
,
(1) 
where 𝐴, 𝐵, and 𝐶 are system matrices of suitable 
dimensions that govern the state transition dynamics, the 
influence of the input, and the mapping to the output, 
respectively. These matrices are defined as 𝐴∈ℝ𝑁×𝑁, 𝐵∈
ℝ𝑁×1, and 𝐶∈ℝ𝑁×1. 
For practical implementation, the continuous-time 
model is discretized using a zero-order hold approximation, 
converting the system matrices 𝐴 and 𝐵 into their discrete 
counterparts over a sampling period ∆. The discretized 
system is represented as: 
{𝐴= 𝑒∆𝐴
𝐵= (∆𝐴)−1(𝑒∆𝐴−𝐼) ∙∆𝐵.
(2) 
The resulting equations for the discrete model are given 
by: 
{ℎ𝑡= 𝐴ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝐵𝑥𝑡
𝑦𝑡= 𝐶ℎ𝑡
.
(3) 
To improve efficiency, the entire sequence output can be 
computed simultaneously using a global convolution, 
boosting both scalability and speed. This is formulated as: 
{
𝑦= 𝑥⨂𝐾
𝐾= (𝐶𝐵, 𝐶𝐴𝐵, … , 𝐶𝐴
𝐿−1𝐵),
(4) 
where ⨂ denotes the convolution operation, 𝐿 represents 
the sequence length, and 𝐾 is the kernel derived from the 
SSM, 
specifically 
tailored 
for 
efficient 
sequence 
processing. 
3.2. Selective State Space Models (S6) 
The linear time-invariant state-space model treats all 
tokens equally, neglecting dynamic content importance. 
Prioritizing more relevant tokens and adjusting attention 
accordingly is more effective for complex inputs. 
Mamba integrates a selectivity mechanism into the state-
space model, creating Selective State Space Models (S6). 
It applies the SSM independently across each channel of an 
input sequence with batch size 𝐵, length 𝐿, and 𝐷 channels. 
In Mamba, the matrices 𝐵, 𝐶, and ∆ are input-dependent, 
allowing adaptive behavior. The discretization process 
with the selectivity mechanism is as follows: 
{
𝐵= 𝑠𝐵(𝑥)
𝐶= 𝑠𝐶(𝑥)
∆= 𝜏𝐴(∆+ 𝑠𝐴(𝑥))
,
(5) 
where 𝐵∈ℝ𝐵×𝐿×𝑁, 𝐶∈ℝ𝐵×𝐿×𝑁 and ∆ ∈ℝ𝐵×𝐿×𝐷. 𝑠𝐵(𝑥) 
and 𝑠𝐶(𝑥) are linear functions that project the input 𝑥 into 
a N-dimensional space, while 𝑠𝐴(𝑥) projects the hidden 
state dimension 𝐷 linearly into the desired dimension, 
connected to the RNN gating mechanism. These compu-
tations transform ∆, 𝐵, and 𝐶 into input-dependent func-
tions of length 𝐿, converting the time-invariant model into 
a time-varying one and enabling selectivity. 
  The parameter ∆ is expanded to (𝐵, 𝐿, 𝐷), giving each 
token in a batch a unique input-dependent control. A larger 
step size for ∆ prioritizes the input, while a smaller one 
emphasizes the stored state. Parameters 𝐵 and 𝐶 become 
input-dependent, refining the control between input 𝑥, state 
ℎ, and output 𝑦. While 𝐴 remains independent, its rele-
vance to the input is introduced via ∆'s data dependency. 
With dimension 𝑁, 𝐴 adapts across SSM dimensions, 
enabling precise generalization. 
3.3. VSS Block 
The VSS Block, derived from VMamba, is central to 
XLSTM-VMUNet. After Layer Normalization, the input 
splits into two branches: one applies a linear layer, the 
other adds depthwise separable convolution and uses the 
2D-Selective-Scan (SS2D) module. The branches are fused, 
normalized, and merged with a residual connection, using 
SiLU as the activation. 
SS2D unfolds the input in four directions, processes it in 
the S6 block, and merges it back, enhancing selectivity by 
adjusting parameters to capture key features and reduce 
noise. Figure 2 reveals the scan expanding operation and 
the scan merging operation in SS2D.

The scan merging operation in SS2D.  
3.4. xLSTM Block 
3.4.1. sLSTM Block 
The sLSTM Block extends the traditional LSTM archi-
tecture by introducing exponential gating and norma-
lization states to enhance the control over information 
storage and flow.  
⚫ Memory Cell and State Update 
The memory cell is updated as follows: 
{𝑐𝑡= 𝑓𝑡𝑐𝑡−1 + 𝑖𝑡𝑧𝑡
𝑧𝑡= 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑊𝑧𝑥𝑡+ 𝑅𝑧ℎ𝑡−1),
(6) 
where 𝑐𝑡 is the memory cell at time step 𝑡, 𝑓𝑡 and 𝑖𝑡 are the 
forget and input gates respectively, 𝑧𝑡 is the candidate 
memory, controlled by 𝑊𝑧 and 𝑅𝑧. 
Normalization state update: 
𝑛𝑡= 𝑓𝑡𝑛𝑡−1 + 𝑖𝑡,
(7) 
where 𝑛𝑡 is the normalization state that balances the 
contribution of the forget and input gates. 
The hidden state is computed as: 
{ℎ𝑡= 𝑜𝑡𝑐𝑡
𝑛𝑡
𝑜𝑡= 𝜎(𝑊𝑜𝑥𝑡+ 𝑅𝑜ℎ𝑡−1)
,
(8) 
where 𝑜𝑡 is the output gate, controlling the final output ℎ𝑡. 
Normalizing 𝑐𝑡 by 𝑛𝑡 ensures numerical stability. 
⚫ Projection and Residual Connection 
The hidden state is further processed through up-
projection, non-linear transformation, and down-projection: 
{  
  𝑦𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡= 𝑊𝑢𝑝−𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡ℎ𝑡
𝑦𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡= 𝑊𝑢𝑝−𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡ℎ𝑡
𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑= 𝐺𝐸𝐿𝑈(𝑦𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡)
𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑡= 𝑊𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛(𝑦𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡∙𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑)
.
(9) 
The final output includes a residual connection: 
𝐹= 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑡+ 𝑥,
(10) 
where 𝐹 represents the final output. 
3.4.2. mLSTM Block 
The mLSTM Block augments memory capacity by 
extending the memory cell from a scalar to a matrix, 
thereby enabling more complex storage and representation.  
⚫ Matrix Memory and Key-Value Storage 
The memory cell is updated in matrix form: 
{
 
 𝐶𝑡= 𝑓𝑡𝐶𝑡−1 + 𝑖𝑡𝑣𝑡𝑘𝑡
𝑇
𝑘𝑡= 1
√𝑑
𝑊𝑘𝑥𝑡+ 𝑏𝑘
𝑣𝑡= 𝑊𝑣𝑥𝑡+ 𝑏𝑣
,
(11) 
where 𝐶𝑡 is the memory matrix, 𝑣𝑡 and 𝑘𝑡 are the value and 
key vectors respectively, 𝑊𝑘, 𝑊𝑣 are the weights for 
generating key and value vectors, 𝑏𝑘, 𝑏𝑣 are the biases. 
⚫ Memory Retrieval and Normalization 
To retrieve information from the matrix memory, 
mLSTMBlock uses a query vector 𝑞𝑡: 
{
 
 ℎ𝑡= 𝑜𝑡⨀
𝐶𝑡𝑞𝑡
𝑚𝑎𝑥(|𝑛𝑡
𝑇𝑞𝑡, 1|)
𝑞𝑡= 𝑊𝑞𝑥𝑡+ 𝑏𝑞
𝑛𝑡= 𝑓𝑡𝑛𝑡−1 + 𝑖𝑡𝑘𝑡
,
(12) 
where 𝑞𝑡 is the query vector and 𝑛𝑡 is the normalization 
state. 
The matrix-based memory update and the retrieval 
mechanism significantly enhance the model’s ability to 
capture complex temporal relationships. By effectively 
managing and retaining information across time steps, it 
preserves long-term dependencies. This dynamic memory 
adjustment improves the model's capacity to model 
intricate temporal patterns, which is crucial for tasks 
involving sequential data, where understanding complex 
dependencies is essential for accurate modeling. 
3.5. XLSTM-VMUNet 
3.5.1. VSSM Feature Extraction 
The architecture integrates the VSSM with the xLSTM 
component through the XLSTM-VMUNet framework.  
The Visual Structured State Model (VSSM) is respon-
sible for extracting deep spatial features from the input 
image. Given an input image 𝑥∈ℝ𝐻×𝑊×𝐶, VSSM utilizes 
multiple convolution and pooling layers to progressively 
extract essential features. 
For a given layer 𝑙, let 𝐹(𝑙) denote the feature map after 
convolution. The convolution operation in VSSM is 
defined as: 
𝐹(𝑙) = 𝜎(𝑊(𝑙)⨂𝐹(𝑙−1) + 𝑏(𝑙)),
(13) 
where 𝑊(𝑙) represents the weight matrix of layer 𝑙, 𝑏(𝑙) is 
the bias term for layer 𝑙, ⨂ denotes the convolution 
operation, 𝜎 is the activation function (e.g., ReLU), and 𝑥 
is the input image. 
Through these layered convolutions, VSSM produces a 
set of multi-scale spatial features, denoted as {𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(1) ,
𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(2) , … , 𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(𝐿) }, where each 𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(𝑙)
 spatial information at 
different scales, providing rich representations for subse-
quent sequence modeling. 
3.5.2. Sequence Modeling with xLSTM 
Following spatial feature extraction, the xLSTM net-
work is employed to model long short-term dependencies. 
Let the spatial features from VSSM be 𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀=
{𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(1) , … , 𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(𝐿) }, where each 𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(𝑙)
 represents a timestep 
in the sequence. 
The xLSTM state update equations are: 
{
 
 
 
 𝑖𝑡= 𝜎(𝑊𝑖∙𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(𝑡)
+ 𝑈𝑖∙ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑖)
𝑓𝑡= 𝜎(𝑊𝑓∙𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(𝑡)
+ 𝑈𝑖∙ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑓)
𝑜𝑡= 𝜎(𝑊𝑜∙𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(𝑡)
+ 𝑈𝑜∙ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑜)
𝑔𝑡= 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑊𝑔∙𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀
(𝑡)
+ 𝑈𝑔∙ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑔)
,
(14) 
where 𝑖𝑡, 𝑓𝑡 and 𝑜𝑡 denote the input gate, forget gate, and 
output gate at timestep 𝑡 respectively, 𝑔𝑡 represents the 
candidate state, 𝑊𝑖, 𝑊𝑓, 𝑊𝑜, 𝑊𝑔 are weight matrices for the 
gates, 𝑈𝑖, 𝑈𝑓, 𝑈𝑜, 𝑈𝑔 are weight matrices associated with 
the hidden state ℎ𝑡−1 from the previous timestep, 𝑏𝑖, 𝑏𝑓, 𝑏𝑜, 
𝑏𝑔 are bias vectors, 𝜎 is the sigmoid activation function. 
The cell state 𝑐𝑡 and hidden state ℎ𝑡 are updated as 
follows: 
{𝑐𝑡= 𝑓𝑡⨀𝑐𝑡−1 + 𝑖𝑡⨀𝑔𝑡
ℎ𝑡= 𝑜𝑡⨀𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑐𝑡)
,
(15) 
where 𝑐𝑡 is the cell state at timestep 𝑡, ℎ𝑡 represents the 
hidden state at timestep 𝑡, ⨀ denotes the element-wise 
multiplication, 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ is the hyperbolic tangent activation 
function. 
This gating mechanism enables xLSTM to selectively 
retain or forget spatial features, which is critical for 
preserving long-term dependencies and contextual infor-
mation across sequential image data. 
3.5.3. Multi-level Feature Fusion 
The model employs a multi-level feature fusion 
mechanism to combine the spatial features from VSSM and 
temporal features from xLSTM, resulting in a compre-
hensive representation. Let 𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀 be the spatial feature 
map from VSSM, and 𝐻𝑥𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 be the hidden state output 
from xLSTM. The fused feature map 𝐹𝑓𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 is given by: 
𝐹𝑓𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛= 𝛼∙𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀+ 𝛽∙𝐻𝑥𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀,
(16) 
where 𝐹𝑓𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 represents the fused feature map that 
combines spatial and temporal information, 𝛼 and 𝛽 are 
fusion weights, determining the contributions of 𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀 and 
𝐻𝑥𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 to the fused feature, 𝐹𝑉𝑆𝑆𝑀 captures spatial 
structure, and 𝐻𝑥𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 captures sequential and memory-
dependent features. 
This fusion strategy enables the model to capture 
complex patterns across both spatial and temporal domains, 
enhancing segmentation performance on challenging data. 
3.5.4. Loss function 
The introduction of XLSTM-VMUNet is designed to 
evaluate the potential benefits of combining Mamba with 
xLSTM for more efficient skin lesion segmentation. In this 
context, we focus solely on the most fundamental loss 
functions, namely Binary Cross-Entropy and Dice loss 
(denoted as BceDice loss), for the skin lesion segmentation 
task. These loss functions are formally represented in 
Equations 17. 
𝐿𝐵𝑐𝑒𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒= 𝜆1𝐿𝐵𝑐𝑒+ 𝜆2𝐿𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒,
(17) 
{
  
  𝐿𝐵𝑐𝑒= −1
𝑁∑[𝑦𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑦̂𝑖) + (1 −𝑦𝑖)𝑙𝑜𝑔(1 −𝑦̂𝑖)]
𝑁
𝑖=1
𝐿𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒= 1 −2|𝑋∩𝑌|
|𝑋| + |𝑌|
, (18) 
where 𝑁 denotes the total number of samples, 𝑦𝑖, 𝑦̂𝑖 
respectively signify the true label and prediction. |𝑋| and 
|𝑌| represent the ground truth and prediction, respectively. 
𝜆1, 𝜆2 refer to the weights of loss functions, which are both 
set to 1 by default. 
4. Experiments 
4.1. Dataset   
The dermoscopic images utilized for both training and 
evaluation were derived from the ISIC 2018 Machine 
Learning Challenge (ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis for 
Melanoma Detection) [109,110,111]. The training dataset 
consists of 8,010 samples, which are categorized into seven 
distinct disease classes. For the evaluation phase, a subset 
of 161 samples was selected from the original training set 
[112,113,114]. The lesion images were sourced from the 
HAM10000 dataset, which is publicly accessible via both 
the archive gallery and standardized API endpoints. 
Throughout the ISIC 2018 challenge, image data, along 
with corresponding diagnostic information and ground-
truth labels, were made available for download. The 
competition is organized around three separate tasks, each 
addressing different facets of skin lesion analysis, 
providing a comprehensive evaluation of model perfor-
mance in melanoma detection: 
- Task 1: Lesion Segmentation,  
- Task 2: Lesion Attribute Detection, 
- Task 3: Disease Classification. 
In this study, we focus on Task 1 of the ISIC 2018: Skin 
Lesion Analysis for Melanoma Detection grand challenge. 
4.2. Implementation Details   
The images from the ISIC2018 dataset are preprocessed 
to a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels before being fed into 
the model. Training is conducted with a batch size of 8, 
utilizing the AdamW optimizer [92] with an initial learning 
rate of 1 × 10−3. In order to facilitate dynamic learning 
rate adjustments throughout the training process, a Cosine- 
AnnealingLR scheduler [93] is employed. All experiments 
are conducted on a single NVIDIA TESLA A100-PCIE-
40GB GPU for 150 epochs, providing the computational 
power necessary for efficient training and evaluation.

4.3. Results 
Segmentation performamnce. In order to demonstrate the 
effective of our proposed approach, we conducted a 
comparative analysis of XLSTM-VMUNet against other 
state-of-the-art methodologies. Specifically, they include 
R2U-Net [84], Attention R2U-Net [89], Attention-U-Net 
[102], U-Net [16], U-Net++[17], Swin-U-Net [85], Res-U-
Net [101][, CaraNet [86], FANet [90], PraNet [87], VM-
UNetv2 [88], UltraLight VM-Unet [60], TransUNet [91], 
VM-UNet [53], SkinMamba  [61] and UNeXt [21]. 
Table 1 provides a comparative analysis of the results on 
the ISIC2018 dataset, demonstrating that the proposed 
XLSTM-VMUNet outperforms other models, particularly 
in terms of the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 
Intersection over Union (IoU). The model training process 
is illustrated in Figure 3, while Figure 4 presents a visual 
comparison of the segmentation results. 
 
 
Figure 4. Visualized segmentation results of the proposed 
XLSTM-VMUNet against other state-of-the-arts over the 
ISIC2018 dataset 
 
From the Figure 4, it is evident that the proposed 
XLSTM-VMUNet model exhibits a markedly improved 
sensitivity to fine lesion details compared to conventional 
methods. By effectively capturing multi-scale contextual 
information and leveraging temporal dependencies, 
XLSTM-VMUNet is able to detect subtle variations in 
lesion characteristics, thereby improving the accuracy and 
precision of lesion delineation. This capability is 
particularly critical in medical image analysis, where 
accurate segmentation of lesions is essential for reliable 
diagnosis and treatment planning. 
Ablation study. We conducted an ablation study on the 
ISIC2018 dataset to examine the effectiveness of our 
modules under various configurations as summarized in 
Table 2. The trend plot of the four versions of our XLSTM-
VMUNet Model is shown in Figure 5. Comparison of Dice 
and IoU values across XLSTM-VMUNet versions is 
shown in Figure 6.

From Figure 5 and Figure 6, we can indicate that 
combining VM-UNet with xLSTM shows outstanding 
performance in converging quickly and maintaining 
optimal segmentation performance among the four 
versions of our XLSTM-VMUNet Model. 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, we propose the XLSTM-VMUNet model 
and demonstrate the benefits of effectively combining 
Mamba with xLSTM: XLSTM-VMUNet can not only 
focus on extracting spatial features from images, especially 
the structure and characteristics of skin lesions, but also 
enhance the model’s contextual understanding, allowing it 
to better handle complex structures in medical images. This 
dual integration significantly improves the accuracy of skin 
lesion segmentation and enhances the model’s compu-
tational efficiency. Experimental results indicate that on 
the ISIC2018 dataset, XLSTM-VMUNet outperforms 
UNeXt with a 0.70% improvement in the DSC metric and 
a 0.88% improvement in the IoU metric. Compared to the 
baseline model, VM-UNet, XLSTM-VMUNet shows a 
1.25% increase in the DSC metric and a 2.07% increase in 
the IoU metric.
