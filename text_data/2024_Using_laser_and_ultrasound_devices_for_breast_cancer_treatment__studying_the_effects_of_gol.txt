Abstract 
Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. After surgery, 
chemotherapy, and other invasive treatments, hyperthermia is a suitable choice with the minimal 
side effects. In this paper, the treatment of breast cancer using a combination of laser and ultrasound 
irradiation, in the presence of gold nanoparticles, is investigated. In the simulations, the breast tissue is 
represented as a multilayer structure and the tumor is supposed to consist two parts: a superficial 
section and a deeper region. In the initial stage, the superficial parts of the tumor, which also contain gold 
nanoparticles, are exposed to a continuous laser for 50 seconds followed by a cooling period of 20 seconds. 
Then, for deeper sections, ultrasound irradiation is utilized. The results indicated that the tissue 
necrosis volume was enhanced by the application of nanoparticles. Furthermore, it was 
demonstrated that the combinational application of both of laser and ultrasound irradiation could 
eradicate both the superficial parts of the tumor and the deep parts.

1. Introduction 
Cancer is a cellular-level disease that originates from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells 
and can spread to other areas of the body1. Among all types of cancers, breast cancer is the most 
common and the most dangerous cancer in women worldwide2. With a global mortality rate of 1 
per 5,000 patients, breast cancer has a relatively high mortality rate3. There are numerous factors 
that contribute to the development of breast cancer.  It is believed to be the result of the interaction 
of genetic factors with environmental factors4. There are different methods to treat breast cancer 
such as surgery5, radiation therapy6, hormone therapy7, ultrasound irradiation8, and 
chemotherapy9. Generally, for a malignant tumor that spreads outside the breast and lymph nodes, 
hormone therapy and chemotherapy are preferable choices3. In addition, there are two common 
methods of surgery, mastectomy, in which the entire breast is removed, and lumpectomy, in which 
only some parts of the breast are removed, however, the mentioned methods are invasive and have 
side effects such as hair loss, weight gain, menopause, osteoporosis and other complications3. 
Among all common non-invasive methods, laser therapy and ultrasound radiation, which are both 
based on hyperthermia, have the fewest side effects and are often recommended10,11. In 
hyperthermia treatment, the temperature is increased up to 40 degrees Celsius, which causes tumor 
necrosis with minimal damage to healthy tissue12. The main challenge of hyperthermia method is 
to create a temperature above 40 degrees Celsius and focus it on the tumor. In recent years, 
nanoparticles have been proposed for this purpose. As reported in a lot of literatures, the addition 
of nanoparticles significantly improves the treatment of various cancers. It should be noted that 
the use of nanoparticles has a considerable effect on destroying tumor cells and reducing the 
damage to surrounding tissues13,14. 
Several studies have been conducted on the treatment of breast cancer with hyperthermia. For 
instance, X. Ma et al.15 used Fe3O4-Pd Janus nanoparticles for efficient cancer therapy. They 
showed that Fe3O4-Pd Janus nanoparticles demonstrated significantly high magnetic-photo heating 
efficiency and enhanced ROS generation, enabling effective tumor regression. They also presented 
dual-modal MRI/PA imaging signal enhancement, allowing precise imaging-guided therapy with 
high spatial resolution and accuracy. Furthermore, Burke et al.16 examined the combination of 
multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. Their 
research showed rapid tumor regression and long-term survival in a mouse model, providing a 
promising treatment strategy for breast cancer. In addition, Sharma. D et al.17 investigated the 
effect of varying hyperthermia and ultrasound-stimulated microbubble (USMB) treatment 
parameters on tumor cell death and vascular disruption in breast cancer therapy. They 
demonstrated that combining USMB with hyperthermia enhanced tumor cell death and reduced 
vascular density in breast tumor xenografts. They also highlighted the role of prolonged ultrasound 
pulses and increased ultrasound exposure in enhancing particle penetration and tumor response. 
Hassan et al.18 performed numerical simulations and analytical calculations to compare the 
interaction of therapeutic ultrasound with a multilayer tissue at different frequencies and 
stimulation times, by focusing on calculating the temperature in different tissues. According to 
their research, the highest temperature observed in the tumor was 45.5°C at a frequency of 1.5 
MHz, which was favorable in destroying the cancerous cells without causing significant damage 
to surrounding tissues. Analytical results represented that the highest temperature predicted in the 
tumor was 47.77°C, and the two solutions were considered to be in good agreement.  
It has also been reported that the integration of different therapeutic methods can produce 
promising results in the treatment of tumor cells. In 2022, Kabiri and Rezaei19 examined the 
effectiveness of combining nanoparticle-mediated laser emission and microwave irradiation in treating liver 
cancer and showed that integrating these two modalities could considerably enhance the efficiency and 
accuracy of each of methods. In the present study, the synergistic effect of combining laser 
photothermal therapy with ultrasound irradiation is investigated through FEM simulation and it is 
shown that this intelligent integration of methods can help the necrosis of tumors with complex 
morphology.  
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1 breast cancer model 
In this research, the breast is modeled as a multi-layered hemisphere3 including epidermis, 
papillary dermis, reticular dermis, fat and gland containing a tumor. The radius of the breast is 
assumed to be 65 mm. Moreover, the tumor is assumed to have an arbitrary shape including 
superficial and deep sections. The tumor's width varies from zero to 14.4 mm with the depth of 15 
mm. Figure 1 shows a schematics diagram of the tissue and the tumor designed for the simulation. 
Tables 1 and 2 show the physical properties of tissue, tumor and blood. 
In the present simulation, finite element method (FEM) solves all of the equations and due to the 
luge number of elements in 3 dimensions and limitations of the solver for calculating this models, 
the axial symmetry is considered for this geometry. In this paper, ultrasound beam is produced by 
an acoustic transducer. Figure 2 shows the geometry of the tissue under the acoustic irradiation. It 
should be noted that in figure 2, both the tissue and the acoustic transducer are immersed in water. 
The transducer is a bowl-shaped element with a focal length of 62.64 mm, including an aperture 
with radius of 35 mm, and a hole with the radius of 10 mm in the center. The frequency of the 
transducer is 1 MHz20.  
In this simulation, three lasers with the similar wavelength of 796 nm and various laser powers of  
2W/cm2, 0.5W/cm2 and 0.25W/cm2 utilized19. It sould be mentioned here for avoiding side effects 
we use more accurate laser with less powers and in real experiments one laser can be used several 
times. The laser is countinious laser with the exposure time of 50 s and cooling time of 20 s. Table 
3 shows the optical poperties of the tissue containing the tumor. Moreover, for controlling the 
produced temperature by ultrasound, it radiate to tumor for 60s and then it turn off for 10s. This 
process continues for 10 min. 
In addition, for increasing the heating absorption, gold nanoparticles are added to the medium. The 
nanoparticles are assumed to be homogeneously destributed in the tissue. In this simulation, the 
absorption and scattering coeffient of nanoparticles are 121/cm and 5/cm, respectively21.

Thermal cancer treatment plays a significant role in the field of the clinical applications. This kind 
of treatment causes alteration of the tissue temperature to achieve the thermal ablation of tumors. 
In this procedure, an ultrasound transducer, a laser beam, or microwave applies mechanical or light 
energy to tissues, leading to an elevation in temperature and subsequently, causing the demise of 
cancerous cells25. The issue with the physical bioheat problems, is evaluation of the temperature 
profile and the fluence rate distribution in the tumorous region with knowing the governing initial 
and boundary conditions, geometry, heat sources, as well as the thermo physical and optical 
properties of the tissues. Generally, in living tissues, blood perfusion and passage of blood modifies 
the heat transfer. Furthermore, metabolic activity generates heat within the tissue. Therefore, an 
equation is needed for describing the heat transfer in tissue by considering the effects of both blood 
perfusion and metabolism. 
This relation, widely known as Penne’s equation, was first established by Penne (1948) and Perl 
(1962)26,27,28 as below: 
 
where, 𝜌 is density of tissue, 𝑐𝑃 is heat capacity, T is temperature, t is time, 𝑘 is thermal 
conductivity of tissue, 𝜌𝑏 is blood density, 𝜔𝑏 is blood perfusion, 𝑐𝑏 is heat capacity of blood, 𝑇𝑏 
is temperature of blood, 𝑄𝑚𝑒𝑡 indicates the metabolic heat source term, and 𝑄𝑠 is the external heat 
source. Here, there are two heat sources, laser and ultrasound as follow:  
𝐎𝐬= 𝐐𝐋+ 𝐐𝐔𝐒                                                                                                                                              (2) 
In the following sections, each of these heat sources will be analyzed and then inserted into Eq. 
(1) 
  
2.3 Interaction of laser and tissue 
In this research, laser beam is one of the main heat sources for tumor ablation. When an incident 
laser beam enters the medium in direction Ω, part of its intensity is absorbed and another part of 
that is scattered in another direction, 𝛺′. The fraction that is absorbed is shown by 𝜎𝑎 I(Ω) and the 
scattered fraction is indicated by 𝜎𝑠 I(Ω), where 𝜎𝑎 and 𝜎𝑠 are absorption and scattering 
coefficients. For obtaining the energy deposited at each point, one needs to solve the radiative 
transfer equation (RTE). For quasi-static conditions, which are met in the current study, RTE obeys 
the following equation29: 
𝛀. 𝛁𝐈(𝛀) = 𝛔𝐚𝐈𝐛(𝐓) − (𝛔𝐚+ 𝛔𝐬)𝐈(𝛀) + 
𝛔𝐬

In the above equation, 𝐼𝑏 denotes the blackbody intensity, which is derived from the Plank function 
and ϕ (Ω′, Ω) signifies the probability that the beam will scatter from direction Ω′ toward the 
direction Ω. The last term of the right-hand side of this equation accounts for the portion of the 
 𝝆𝒄𝑷
𝝏𝑻
𝝏𝒕= 𝜵⋅(𝒌𝜵)−𝝆𝒃𝝎𝒃𝑪𝒃(𝑻−𝑻𝒃) + 𝑸𝒎𝒆𝒕+ 𝑸𝒔                                (1) 
radiative energy coming from all possible directions which is scattered toward the considered 
direction of propagation. 
Generally, different methods such as discrete ordinates method (DOM), P1-approximation, 
Rosseland approximation, and Beer–Lambert law are employed to solve the RTE. The P1 
approximation stands out as one of the best and the most straightforward methods for solving the 
RTE, utilizing spherical harmonics with the capability of incorporating both isotropic and linear 
anisotropic scattering within its framework. In P1-approximation method, incident radiation is 
defined as30: 
𝐆= ∫
𝐈(𝛀) ⅆ𝛀
𝟒𝛑
                                                                                                                                             (4) 
and, radiative heat flux is expressed as30: 
𝐪𝐫= ∫
𝐈(𝛀)
𝟒𝛑
ⅆ𝛀                                                                                                                                           (5) 
 
By applying G and 𝑞𝑟 to the RTE, it can be rewritten as below30: 
 
𝐈(𝐫, 𝛀̂) = 
𝟏
𝟒𝛑[𝐆(𝐫) + 3q(𝐫). 𝛀̂]                                                                                                    (6) 
 
When the laser beam irradiates into the medium, I in the equation will be consisted of the 
collimated laser beam entering the medium and the diffusion term emerging from scattering within 
the medium. As described by Modest and Tabanfar in Ref.30, in such scenarios, the impact of the 
external radiation field can be taken into account by introducing a source term into the diffusion 
terms. Hence, the simplified version of RTE emphasizes on the diffusion of light due to scattering 
phenomenon, and the source term which directly incorporates the influence of the external 
collimated beam from the laser as bellow30: 
 
𝛁⋅(𝐃𝐏𝟏𝛁𝐆) - 𝛔𝐚(G-4𝜋𝐈𝐛)=0                                                                                                           (7) 
 
here, 𝐷𝑃1is diffusion coefficient in P1-approximation method and is defined as30: 
 
𝐃𝐏𝟏= 
𝟏
𝟑𝛔𝐚+ 𝛔𝐬(𝟑−𝐚𝟏)                                                                                                                            (8) 
 
where, 𝑎1 is the linear Legendre coefficient for the scattering phase function. This coefficient is 
related to anisotropy so that for the case of isotropic scattering a1 equals to zero. 
Then, in the Penne equation, 𝑄𝐿 is the laser heat source which is calculated by the divergence of 
heat flux 𝑞𝑟. That is because the radiative heat flux crossing an element with an area normal to the 
direction of 𝞨 is a result of intensities incident from all directions and it is the divergence of heat 
flux at any point which leads to rising the temperature at that point. It should be stressed that once 
G is characterized at each point, ∇ · 𝑞𝑟 can be found. 
Moreover, addition of gold nanoparticles significantly modifies the optical features of the tissue. 
In this paper absorption and scattering coefficient of gold nanoparticles are 121/cm and 0.5/cm, 
respectively21. 
 
2.4 Interaction of ultrasound with tissue 
As previously mentioned, ultrasound can be considered as a heat source. Here, the absorbed 
acoustic energy is calculated and used as the heat source,𝑄𝑈𝑆 , in Penne’s equation. 
The propagation of the focused ultrasound waves as a time-independent problem follows the 
homogenous Helmholtz equation in 2D axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates as below20:

where, r and z are the radial and axial coordinates, p is the acoustic pressure, and 𝜔 is the angular 
frequency. 𝜌𝑐 is density and 𝐶𝐶 is the speed of sound which are also complex-valued to account 
for the material's damping properties.  
In Helmholtz equation, it is assumed that the acoustic wave propagation is linear and the amplitude 
of the shear waves in the tissue domain are much smaller than that of the pressure waves. 
Therefore, nonlinear effects and shear waves are neglected. 
The acoustic intensity field can also be derived from the acoustic pressure field. Finally, by 
knowing the acoustic intensity field, 𝑄𝑈𝑆  is calculated as below20:   
𝐐𝐔𝐒 = 2𝛂𝐀𝐁𝐂I = 2𝛂𝐀𝐁𝐂|𝐑𝐞(

𝟐𝐩𝐯)|                                                                                              (10)   
here, 𝛼𝐴𝐵𝐶, I, p and v are attenuation coeffient, acoustic intensity magnitude, the acoustic pressure, 
and acoustic particle velocity vector, respectively. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that 
attenuation coefficient of tissue with and without gold nanoparticle is 70 dB/m and 43 dB/m, 
respectively24.   
 
2.5 Thermal damage 
An important concern in research about bioheat transfer is accurate and appropriate thermal 
damage of the diseased tissues without any destruction of the neighboring healthy tissues during 
tumor treatment. Several investigations have demonstrated that tissue damage depends on both of 
the temperature and exposure time. It should be mentioned that as tissue temperature increases, 
the elapsed time necessary to achieve the threshold of damages decreases. The progression of the 
thermal injury can be reasonably approximated by Arrhenius equation. This relation is usually 
utilized for illustrating the rate of the irreversible heating damage of the biological tissues31,32: 
 
𝛀(t) = ∫𝐀

𝐞𝐑𝐓ⅆ𝐭

                                                                                                                           (11) 
 
In the above equation, 𝛺(t) indicates the degree of tissue injury, R is the universal gas constant, A 
is the frequency factor for kinetic expression, and ¬E is the activation energy for irreversible 
damage reaction. The critical value of 𝛺 = 1 is the point when thermal necrosis occurs. Generally, 
two parameters of A and 𝛥E depend on the type of tissue. Here, for the breast tissue A and 𝛥𝐸 are 
1.18×1044 and 3.02×1055, respectively3. 
 
3. Validation of the simulation results 
To validate the accuracy of the proposed model, the results of the ultrasound transducer simulation 
and nanoparticle-mediated laser therapy model are compared with previous literatures.  
It is important to mention that the simulation of laser photothermal therapy with nanoparticles in 
the current model is based on the same model utilized in our previous paper19 on liver cancer 
treatment. In our previous paper, it was shown that under similar conditions, the results of our 
simulations agree well with those obtained by Sony et al21 [see figure 3 of our previous article19]. 
In order to validate the results of the FEM simulation of the ultrasonic probe, the present model is 
compared to the research conducted by Huang et al.33 in 2004. Figure 3 depicts the 2D 
axisymmetric geometry used by Huang et al. in their paper. For validation, the same model with 
similar dimensions, boundary conditions, and physical properties is considered to measure the 
temperature of the tissue phantom at the ultrasound focus. Figure 4 illustrates the heating and 
cooling curves characteristic of this study, along with the results from the experiments and 
simulations conducted by Huang et al. As it is clearly seen in this figure, the data of the present 
model is in complete agreement with the results of the simulations of the previous literature. 
Nonetheless, there is a small difference between the experimental data and the data of the current 
simulation.  These differences can be attributed to some approximations assumed in the simulation, 
while the overall fit to the simulation curve is quite remarkable.

4. Results and Discussion 
This study utilized numerical analysis to examine the tissue's mechanical and thermal response to 
ultrasound and laser exposure in order to determine how adjustable parameters can precisely ablate 
a tumor, while minimizing nociceptive pain and causing no damage to adjacent healthy tissue. 
Usually, it is difficult to remove the tumor without causing harm to the healthy tissues around. 
Therefore, to reduce the possibility of thermal tissue damage, gold nanoparticles are introduced 
into the tumor when it is being exposed to diode laser irradiation. This raises the tumor's 
temperature above normal, while shielding the surrounding healthy tissues. It should be noted that 
the lasers used in this instance are pulsed lasers, meaning they heat up for 50 seconds and cool 
down for 20 seconds. The problem is performed twice, once with and once without the insertion 
of Au nanoparticles, in order to determine the impacts of gold nanoparticles on the enhancement 
of temperature in the tissue. The findings of the comparison are then displayed.  
 
4.1 The effect of Nanoparticles on heating by laser and ultrasound 
To understand the effect of nanoparticles on increasing the temperature of tumor region and the 
amount of necrosis, the problem is solved once with nanoparticles and again without nanoparticles. 
The laser used in this study is a continuous laser with the exposure time of 50s and cooling time 
of 20s.Also the exposure time of US is 60s and its cooling time is 10s. Figures 5 shows the 
temperature of the tissue after laser irradiation, with and without presence of gold nanoparticles 
for 10 min. In the absence of gold nanoparticles, the temperature of the tumor reaches 38°C and 
when gold nanoparticle is injected, the temperature increases to 54°C. And the figure 6 shows the 
volume of necrosis without and again with gold nanoparticles injection to the tumor after 10 min 
of US irradiation.  As it can be seen in the picture 6, injection of gold nanoparticle causes the cell 
death in deep section of the tumor noticeably increase. As well as the depiction of the acoustic 
pressure in the water and tissue domain is given in figure 7.

4.2 Combining focused ultrasound and laser photo thermal therapy 
Figure 6 shows the temperature rise in the tissue after 10 min of receiving laser and ultrasound 
irradiation, simultaneously. As it can be seen in this figure 6, the minimum temperature is 20°C, 
i.e. the body temperature, and the maximum temperature reaches 100°C after 10 minutes of laser 
and ultrasound irradiation together.    
The important issue that determines the successful of method is the fraction of damaged tissue, 
which is presented in figure 7. Figure 7a shows the fraction of the damage after 10 min of laser 
illumination, while figure 7b presents the damage fraction after 10 min ultrasound irradiation. 
Finally, figure 7c illustrates the status when the tissue is simultaneously irradiated by both of laser 
and ultrasound for 10 min.

To check that this method has not damaged the surrounding healthy tissue, the fraction of the 
necrotic tissue along four lines, crossing the tissue model is evaluated at different places. For this 
purpose, two vertical and two horizontal lines are chosen to help us to have a better judgment on 
the damage estimation in both superficial and deep areas. The horizontal lines are positioned at z 
= 54 and z = 60, while the vertical lines are located at r = 6 and r = 10 of figure 8. The necrosis 
fraction along the horizontal and vertical lines are shown in figures 9 and 10, respectively.

areas of tumor. 
 
According to figure 8, the border of the safe region is shown by the yellow color (i.e., necrosis 
fraction equal to 0.7), indicating that there is no serious damage present in the normal sections of 
tissues and the red area indicates damage within the tumor. Therefore, it is obvious that this method 
is both safe and effective for treating cancers.

50, 55 and 60 mm. 
 
In addition, as seen in figure 9, at z=60 mm and at reduced radial distances, wider areas are more 
vulnerable to necrosis because they are near to laser and ultrasound radiations. Moreover, the 
necrosis proportion is minimal at long radial distances in all horizontal lines, demonstrating the 
lack of adverse effects from this treatment approach. 
A similar pattern is seen in figure 10 at various radial distances, with a slight increase at r = 6 mm. 
Furthermore, as this figure makes evident, the necrosis fraction is greater than 0.7 at z > 62 mm, 
indicating that only the tumor areas are damaged and supporting the usefulness of the suggested 
method.

Conclusion 
In this research, the interaction between laser and breast tissue in the presence of gold nanoparticles 
combined with ultrasound irradiation is studied. The FEM (finite element method) simulations 
revealed that this treatment approach could be exceptionally beneficial for treatment of the tumors 
including both superficial and deep regions. Here, the heat generated by the acoustic transducer 
was estimated using the acoustic intensity magnitude. Furthermore, the magnitude of energy 
produced by laser irradiation and absorbed by GNPs was determined by solving the RTE equation. 
For solving RTE equation, P1-approximation was employed which means isotropic and linear 
anisotropic scatterings were both considered. Finally, Pennes’ equation was solved to calculate the 
temperature within the tumor. 
In summary, the results showed that: 1) Gold nanoparticle injection greatly enhanced the 
effectiveness of the photothermal therapy. 2) In the absence of gold nanoparticles, the temperature 
raised just into 38°C after 10 min laser irradiation. 3) With the injection of gold nanoparticles, the 
temperature of laser irradiation increased up to 100°C after 10 min of laser irradiation. 4) 
Moreover, gold nanoparticles caused the temperature rise up to 100°C after ultrasound irradiation. 
5) The effect of gold nanoparticles on enhancing the heating effect of laser was more than 
ultrasound irradiation, and 6) finally, after 10 min irradiation of laser and ultrasound, most parts of 
the tumor undergo necrosis. Hence, it can be concluded the proposed irradiation of laser and 
ultrasound with the aid of gold nanoparticles could help in treatment of cancer with no damage to 
healthy tissue.
