Abstract
Deep learning models have shown immense promise in computational pathology (CPath) tasks, but their performance often suffers
when applied to unseen data due to domain shifts. Addressing this requires domain generalization (DG) algorithms. However,
a systematic evaluation of DG algorithms in the CPath context is lacking. This study aims to benchmark the effectiveness of 30
DG algorithms on 3 CPath tasks of varying difficulty through 7,560 cross-validation runs. We evaluate these algorithms using a
unified and robust platform, incorporating modality-specific techniques and recent advances like pretrained foundation models. Our
extensive cross-validation experiments provide insights into the relative performance of various DG strategies. We observe that self-
supervised learning and stain augmentation consistently outperform other methods, highlighting the potential of pretrained models
and data augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a new pan-cancer tumor detection dataset (HISTOPANTUM) as a benchmark
for future research. This study offers valuable guidance to researchers in selecting appropriate DG approaches for CPath tasks.

1. Introduction
Deep learning (DL) models have shown great potential in
addressing fundamental problems in computational pathology
(CPath) [1, 2] such as histology image classification [3, 4, 5],
tissue segmentation [6, 7, 8], and nuclei detection [9, 10, 11].
Furthermore, leveraging DL, more advanced problems are be-
ing tackled in the field, such as gene expression prediction
[12, 13, 14] and biomarker discovery [15, 16, 17]. Regardless
of the versatility and accuracy of DL models on the training do-
main data, it has also been shown that testing on unseen data
can degrade the performance metrics considerably [18] (see
Fig. 1A) which is a phenomenon usually caused by domain shift
(DS) [19].
Defining a data ‘domain’ as the joint distribution of feature
(X) and label (Y) spaces, domain shift can be characterized
by discrepancies in the joint distribution of features and labels
across source (s) and target (t) domains, that is, Ps
XY , Pt
XY.
According to the Bayes’ theorem, the joint distribution is given
by PXY = PX|YPY = PY|XPX which can be leveraged to describe
DS manifested in various ways [18]:
• Covariate Shift: The feature distributions differ between
the source and target domains, i.e., Ps
X , Pt
X. Example:
Tissue samples scanned using different scanners exhibit
distinct colors and features.
• Prior Shift: The label distributions vary between the
source and target domains, i.e., Ps
Y , Pt
Y. Example: A

model trained on a dataset with a specific proportion of
cancerous to non-cancerous samples is applied to a new
dataset with a different ratio of these classes.
• Posterior Shift: The conditional label distributions differ,
i.e., Ps
Y|X , Pt
Y|X. Example: Subjective labeling in mitosis
detection where different annotators assign different labels
to the same data due to varying interpretations.
• Class-Conditional Shift: The data characteristics for a
specific class differ between the source and target domains,
i.e., Ps
X|Y=y , Pt
X|Y=y. Example: Morphological traits of
cancer cells in early-stage cancers differ from those in late-
stage cancers, leading to variations in the same class across
datasets.
A schematic presentation of different DS types is adopted
from [18] and shown in Fig. 1B.
An ideal way of, addressing domain shifts would involve
training models across all conceivable data distributions. How-
ever, this approach is typically infeasible due to the limited
availability of comprehensive, multi-domain data during the
training phase. Consequently, there is an urgent need for al-
gorithms specifically designed to improve domain generaliza-
tion (DG). DG refers to the capability of a model trained on
data from source domains Ds to perform well on unseen tar-
get domains Dt despite distributional differences (Ps
XY , Pt
XY).
It is important to note that, unlike domain adaptation tech-
niques [20], DG algorithms enhance generalization to novel tar-
get domains without access to target domain data during train-
ing [21, 18].
There remains a critical gap in the utilization of existing DG
algorithms within CPath. Many sophisticated DG algorithms

Figure 1: Domain shift in computational pathology can cause degradation in performance when testing on an unseen dataset (A). Different types of DS are illustrated
in (B) with shapes as classes, colors as features, and each circle as a domain. In (B), covariate shift is presented by changing the color of objects in two different
domains, prior shift happens when the distribution of classes differs between the two domains, and posterior shift is shown when the same objects are labeled
differently by the observers (highlighted shapes), and in class-conditional shift, the color of only one class is changing between domains. Leveraging three different
tasks (C) in this work, we benchmark the performance of 30 domain generalization algorithms (D) in a series of robust cross-validation experiments (E).
have not been systematically explored in this field. Motivated
by this gap, we present a rigorous evaluation of DG methods in
the CPath context. This research aims to benchmark the effec-
tiveness of 30 different DG algorithms (Fig. 1D) on three differ-
ent CPath tasks of various difficulties (Fig. 1C) in a unified and
robust platform through extensive cross-validation experiments
(Fig. 1E). Our goal is to fairly compare existing DG algorithms
to provide insights that could help researchers to select a bet-
ter strategy for their DG needs. To this end, we build on the
DomainBed platform [22] as our main repository of DG algo-
rithms, by including new DG algorithms (CPath-specific algo-
rithms such as stain normalization and stain augmentation, and
more recent approaches such as a pretrained foundation model),
more robust evaluation metric (F1 score), and two new multi-
domain histology image classification datasets.
This work’s
main contributions can be summarized as follows:
• Presentation of a unified and robust framework for bench-
marking DG algorithms in the area of CPath;
• Benchmarking 30 DG algorithms on 3 different tasks in
CPath using the proposed framework;
• Comprehensive and robust cross-validation experiments,
covering 7,560 training-validation runs;
• Making recommendations for selecting effective DG
strategies in CPath; and
• Releasing

In the remainder of the paper, datasets, algorithms, and cross-
validation procedure are described in Section 2, results are pre-
sented and discussed in sections 3 and 4, and finally, paper is
concluded in Section 5.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Datasets and tasks
In this study, we examine three datasets — CAMELYON17
[23], MIDOG22 [24], and HISTOPANTUM — each chosen for
its specific challenges and domain shifts to facilitate a compre-
hensive evaluation of DG algorithms applied to various classi-
fication tasks in CPath.
2.1.1. CAMELYON17
With the CAMELYON17 grand challenge on the detection
of breast cancer metastases in sentinel lymph nodes, a dataset
with the same name has been released which comprises Whole
Slide Images (WSIs) of lymph node resections in breast cancer
patients and their corresponding lesion-level annotations [23].
The provided annotations have been leveraged for the extrac-
tion of a patch-level dataset of metastatic and normal images
of breast cancer. In particular, we used the CAMELYON17
dataset part of the WILDS toolbox [25] (which is designed
to test machine-learning models against significant distribution
shifts) to allow for the reproducibility of the results.

Figure 2: Tasks and datasets used in the benchmarking process: (A) Breast cancer metastasis detection leveraging Camleyon17 dataset [23], (B) Mitosis detection in
MIDOG22 dataset [24], and (C) tumor detection in our proposed HISTOPANTUM dataset. For every dataset, an example from each domain and class is provided.
All the tasks are designed as a binary classification task, where the name and population of positive and negative classes are shown in red and blue color bars,
respectively. The hatched region in each bar represents the fraction of samples used to generate small datasets (see Section 2.1.4).
CAMELYON17 is gathered from various medical centers in
the Netherlands, including Radboud University Medical Cen-
ter (RUMC), Canisius-Wilhelmina Hospital (CWZ), University
Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), Rijnstate Hospital in Arn-
hem (RST), and the Laboratory of Pathology East-Netherlands
(LPON), each representing a unique domain. CAMELYON17
comprises 455,953 image patches, categorized into metastasis
and non-metastasis (normal) classes, with each patch measuring
96 × 96 pixels at a resolution of 0.5 microns per pixel (mpp).
A major challenge presented by CAMELYON17 is the co-
variate shift, primarily caused by variations in imaging equip-
ment and procedures across different centers. These variations
are evident in the noticeable differences in color and texture
among images from various sources as shown in Fig. 2A. De-
spite covariate shift, the dataset is well balanced in label space,
with an equal number of tumor and non-tumor patches in each
domain, effectively eliminating any potential prior shift in label
distribution. The objective nature of the classification task en-
sures that there is no posterior shift, focusing the analysis solely
on addressing the implications of covariate shifts.
2.1.2. MIDOG22
The second task, mitosis detection, involves classifying mi-
totic figures versus mimickers (cells of other types that are
very similar to mitotic figures in appearance), which is a bi-
nary classification task previously explored in the literature
[18, 11, 26, 27].
For this purpose, we utilize the MIDOG22 dataset [24],
which comprises five domains: Canine Lung Cancer, Human
Breast Cancer, Canine Lymphoma, Canine Cutaneous Mast
Cell Tumor, and Human Neuroendocrine Tumor.
From the
original MIDOG22 dataset and based on the annotations pro-
vided, we extract 20,552 image patches, each sized 128 × 128
pixels at a resolution of 0.25 mpp, and categorize them into mi-
tosis and mimicked classes.
MIDOG22 is particularly challenging for achieving DG due
to the presence of all four types of DS: covariate shift is evident
as the images come from different centers using various scan-
ners, leading to variations in color schemes. There is a prior
shift, as different labels are distributed variably across domains,
clearly shown in the dataset Fig. 2B. The task also involves a
posterior shift due to the highly subjective nature of mitosis
labeling. Additionally, class-conditional shifts occur because
different tumor types and species influence the appearance of
non-mitotic regions in the images, significantly varying from
one domain to another. The complexity of this dataset makes it
a rigorous test bed for assessing the DG capabilities of different
algorithms in CPath.
2.1.3. HISTOPANTUM
The last task we address is pan-cancer tumor detection, lever-
aging the HISTOPANTUM dataset that we were releasing in
this study. This dataset captures four different cancer types:
Colorectal (CRC), Uterus (UCEC), Ovary (OV), and Stomach
(STAD), collectively referred to as four domains. During data
curation, we source 40 WSIs for each cancer type from its
related study in The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA)
[28]. For sampling, we make sure to include a variety of tumor
subtypes (adenocarcinoma and mucinous carcinoma), genders,
ethnicities, and centers in order to make the dataset as diverse as
possible. Then, an experienced pathologist (FS) meticulously
annotates tumor and non-tumor regions in the slides, which are
used to extract tumor and non-tumor patches from the WSIs to
form the HISTOPANTUM dataset.
The HISTOPANTUM dataset includes 281,142 patches,
each 512 × 512 pixels at a resolution of about 0.5 mpp which
are subsequently resized to 224×224 pixels during training and
evaluation. HISTOPANTUM patches are classified into two
3
classes: tumor and non-tumor (normal). This dataset presents
three significant types of DS. Firstly, a covariate shift arises
due to images being sourced from different centers using differ-
ent slide preparation and scanning devices, introducing notable
variations in color and stain schemes. Secondly, a prior shift is
observed with a distinct distribution of classes across domains,
as depicted in Fig. 2C. Lastly, the class-conditional shift is evi-
dent as different cancer types influence the appearance of tumor
region in the images (morphology of tumor cells varies signif-
icantly from one tumor to another), while non-tumor regions
remain relatively consistent across domains (for example, the
morphology of stromal and inflammatory regions are very sim-
ilar across different cancer types). Notably, this dataset does not
suffer from the posterior shift, thanks to the objective nature of
the labeling process, eliminating subjectivity in tumor detec-
tion. We are making the HISTOPANTUM publicly available as
a benchmark for pan-cancer tumor detection 2.
2.1.4. Subsampled datasets
In addition to the primary experiments, we conduct a series
of tests to understand how different DG algorithms perform un-
der a low-data budget scenario. This analysis is crucial for ap-
plications where data availability is limited. For this purpose,
we create smaller versions of the original datasets, maintaining
similar distributions but significantly smaller populations.
The reduced (small) datasets are generated by randomly sam-
pling the following percentages of each class in the original
datasets (as hatched regions shown in the bar plots of Fig. 2):
• sCAMELYON17: 1% of the original CAMELYON17
dataset (N=4,560).
• sHISTOPANTUM: 3% of the original HISTOPANTUM
dataset (N=8,434).
• sMIDOG22 : 30% of the original MIDOG22 dataset
(N=6,166).
The sampling percentage in each dataset is set to consid-
erably reduce dataset size while keeping enough samples for
convergence of DG algorithms. The same experimental setup,
model selection strategy, and algorithms used in the original ex-
periments are applied to these smaller datasets. This approach
allows us to directly compare the performance and general-
ization capability of the algorithms in both ‘large dataset’ and
‘small dataset’ scenarios.
2.2. Algorithms
We utilize DomainBed [22] as our main benchmarking tool
because it offers a robust and well-tested platform for fair and
reproducible comparison of different DG algorithms. Further-
more, DomainBed is well maintained and contains the most
number of state-of-the-art DG algorithms implemented in com-
parison to other DG benchmarking tools (such as DeepDG

https://github.com/mostafajahanifar/HistoDomainBed
Figure 3: Benchmarked algorithms categorized into different domain general-
ization methodologies, as introduced in [18]
[29]).
Using DomainBed, we can test different DG algo-
rithms while also controlling algorithms and training hyper-
parameters.
As well as the DomainBed implemented algo-
rithms, we also investigate the two CPath-specific algorithms,
namely stain normalization and stain augmentation, and a self-
supervised learning (SSL) based algorithm in the same struc-
tured experimental setup of DomainBed. Furthermore, we have
also added the F1-score evaluation metric to the platform which
originally included only the Accuracy metric. The code base
for our updated DomainBed platform, called HistoDomainBed,
is available at: https://github.com/mostafajahanifar/
HistoDomainBed.
All the algorithms in our experiments use a standard
ResNet50 [30] model for feature extraction due to its proven
generalization capabilities and popularity. The preferred model
selection strategy in our work is the “training-domain validation
set”, recognized for its effectiveness in different scenarios and
datasets as shown previously in [22]. More information on how
we performed cross-validation experiments using DomainBed
is given in Section 2.3.
In the rest of this section, we introduce the DG algorithms
investigated in this work. Explaining the methodology of each
algorithm is outside of the scope of this work, although we
have categorized these algorithms into 6 distinct categories of
DG methods based on their working principles and the intro-
duction of the categories in [18].
Domain alignment tech-
niques bridge domain gaps by harmonizing feature representa-
tions, employing methods like stain normalization and genera-
tive models. Data augmentation enhances model generalization
through image transformations and generative networks. Meta-
learning enables quick adaptation to new domains or tasks us-
ing techniques like MAML [31]. Tailored model design strate-
4
gies leverage the unique characteristics of histopathology im-
ages with specialized network architectures and loss functions.
Pretraining strategies use self-supervised, unsupervised, and
semi-supervised learning to enhance feature encoding and gen-
eralizability. Regularization strategies prevent overfitting and
improve performance on unseen data by introducing constraints
and penalties. Domain separation learns disentangled domain-
specific and domain-agnostic features.
A chart showing the investigated DG algorithms and their
related category is presented in Fig. 3. For more information on
these categories or related methods, please refer to [18] or the
respective cited articles.
2.2.1. DomainBed algorithms
DomainBed [22], developed by the Facebook Research
group, is a comprehensive PyTorch suite. At the time of writing
this manuscript, it encompassed support for 27 DG algorithms,
10 computer vision datasets, and one CPath dataset (Came-
lyon17 WILDS [25]). The toolkit includes algorithms such as
Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) [32], Interdomain Mixup
(Mixup) [33], Group Distributionally Robust Optimization
(GroupDRO) [34], Conditional Domain Adversarial Neural
Network (CDANN) [35], Learning Explanations that are Hard
to Vary (AND-Mask) [36], Deep CORAL (CORAL) [37], Self-
supervised Contrastive Regularization (SelfReg) [38], Marginal
Transfer Learning (MATL) [39], and Adaptive Risk Mini-
mization (ARM) [40].
It also supports Invariant Risk Min-
imization (IRM) [41], Domain Adversarial Neural Network
(DANN) [42], Style Agnostic Networks (SagNet) [43], Learn-
ing Representations that Support Robust Transfer of Predic-
tors (TRM) [44], Optimal Representations for Covariate Shift
(CAD and CondCAD) [45], Representation Self-Challenging
(RSC) [46], Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) [47], Out-
of-Distribution generalization with Maximal Invariant Predic-
tor (IGA) [48], Variance Risk Extrapolation (VREx) [49], and
Invariance Principle Meets Information Bottleneck for Out-of-
Distribution generalization (IB-ERM) [50]. Additional algo-
rithms include Empirical Quantile Risk Minimization (EQRM)
[51], Spectral Decoupling (SD) [52], Quantifying and Improv-
ing Transferability in Domain generalization (Transfer) [53],
Smoothed-AND mask (SAND-mask) [54], Meta-Learning Do-
main generalization (MLDG) [55], and Invariant Causal Mech-
anisms through Distribution Matching (CausIRL with CORAL
or MMD) [56].
2.2.2. CPath-specific algorithms
Ideally, the same tissue specimens, stained in different lab-
oratories, should yield identical results, but this ideal is often
unattainable. Stain variation can arise from differences in slide
scanners, stain quality and concentration, and staining proce-
dure [57]. Pathologists can easily disregard irrelevant features
(such as stain variation) in a WSI that do not impact their diag-
nosis. However, deep learning models sometimes struggle with
this task [58].
Stain Normalization. A preprocessing step that aligns the color
distributions of histology images to a reference image, counter-
ing discrepancies from varied staining procedures and scanners.
Stain normalization techniques range from linear scaling and
histogram matching to advanced methods by Ruifrok [59], Ma-
cenko [60], and Vahadane [61]. These methods adjust the stain
matrix of source images while maintaining their stain concen-
trations, ensuring color consistency without altering structural
details. In this work, we compare Macenko [60] stain normal-
ization algorithm implemented in TIAToolbox [62]. To this end,
we normalize the stain of all images in all datasets offline, uti-
lizing the same reference image, to maintain training efficiency.
Stain Augmentation (StainAug). A method that involves de-
composing RGB histology images into stain components, per-
turbing them, and recomposing the images to introduce vari-
ability. This technique has proven effective in numerous tasks
and helps improve model generalizability [18, 58, 63].
In
HistoDomainBed, stain augmentation was randomly done on
the fly using TIAToolbox [62].
To this end, the Macenko
method [60] was used to extract the stain matrix and compo-
nents from the RGB image.
It is important to note that both Macenko and StainAug al-
gorithms are employed on top of the Empirical Risk Minimiza-
tion (ERM) [32] approach. In other words, Macenko refers to
the scenario where we use ERM on stain-normalized images
and StainAug is the scenario where the stain augmentation tech-
nique is used during the training of the ERM model on original
images.
2.2.3. Self-supervised learning (SSL)
For our SSL experiments, we use a ResNet50 model pre-
trained on histology images to start each run instead of ini-
tializing the model with ImageNet weights. In particular, we
choose a foundation model from the work of Kang et al. [64]
which has a ResNet50 architecture and is pretrained on 19M
image patches from different studies of TCGA using Barlow
Twin self-supervised learning algorithm [65]. The utilized SSL
algorithm also works on top of the ERM algorithm in our
HistoDomainBed platform.
2.3. Cross-validation and model selection
Gulrajani et al. [22] meticulously examined three distinct
model selection scenarios, which are crucial for determining
how the performance of a model on a validation set can guide
the selection of the best training epoch for application on un-
seen test sets. The scenarios we explore are:
1. Training-domain validation set: This involves pooling a
validation set from all training domains, a standard prac-
tice of training/validation split across domains. The best-
performing model of the validation set is then tested on
hold-out test domains.
2. Leave-one-domain-out validation: In this scenario, one
of the training domains is reserved for validation. The
model that performs best on this holdout domain is then
re-trained on all domains before being applied to the test
domains.
5
3. Test-domain validation set (oracle): This scenario selects
the model that maximizes accuracy on a validation set mir-
roring the test domain’s distribution, albeit with limited
queries. Although this is theoretically not a valid model
selection method due to its reliance on access to the test
domain, in the original DomainBed [22] it was included
for comparative analysis.
Based on findings of the DomainBed study [22], the
“training-domain validation set” model selection scenario con-
sistently yielded the best results on different datasets and using
different algorithms. Thus, we have chosen to adopt this model
selection strategy for our experiments to allow us to minimize
computational demands and focus our resources on evaluating
the effectiveness of the DG algorithms themselves, rather than
delving into various model selection techniques. In our model
selection strategy, we allocate 20% of the training data for val-
idation purposes.
For robust cross-validation, one domain was systematically
left out for testing, and this process was repeated across the
number of domains available in each task (Run 1, 2, 3, ...). An
illustration of the utilized cross-validation process is given in
Fig. 1E, where there are 4 domains and therefore 4 runs, and
in each run data from three domains are used for training and
validation (80%-20%), and 1 domain is left out for testing. All
the metrics reported in this work are based on results of experi-
ments on unseen test domains.
To ensure the reliability of our results, we varied the hyper-
parameters (such as batch size, learning rate, and algorithm-
specific parameters) randomly three times for each experiment.
Each set of hyperparameters was then used to conduct three
independent runs, leading to a total of nine training runs for
each domain and method combination. The working range of
algorithms’ hyperparameters is selected based on convergence
experiments done for each algorithm beforehand. In summary,
this comprehensive cross-validation approach resulted in a to-
tal of 7,560 training-validation runs for both full and small
datasets (P
d∈datasets 9 × 30 × Nd
domains), illustrating the extensive
scale and rigorous nature of our experimental design.
In all the runs, we utilize an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet50
model [30] (except for SSL algorithm which uses histology-
pretrained weights as a starting point), trained for approxi-
mately 30 epochs using an Adam optimizer. All the experi-
ments are performed using 8 NVidia Tesla V100 GPUs on a
DGX2 machine.
3. Results
This section presents the performance metrics of different
algorithms across various datasets. The metrics reported are
binary F1 score and accuracy.
We added the F1 score to
HistoDomainBed to account for the scenarios where the data
is significantly imbalanced, rendering accuracy a sub-optimal
metric. Using Accuracy and F1 Score, we can comprehensively
understand our models’ performance across different domains,
ensuring that our evaluation is robust and reliable.
3.1. Results for full datasets
We present the performance metrics of various algorithms
across full-scale datasets in Table 1. Accuracy and F1 metrics
are reported for each dataset (task) separately as well as for the
average performance across all the tasks. The rows in Table 1
are ordered by the average F1 score across all tasks. In each
column, cells are colored from red to green based on the perfor-
mance values, red indicating worse and green indicating better
performance.
The majority of methods exhibited similar performance, with
average F1 scores ranging from 81% to 85%, except for the
top 2 algorithms. SSL [64] and StainAug [58] methods consis-
tently outperform all other methods on average, both in terms
of F1 score (87.7%, 86.5%) and accuracy (88.9%, 87.4%).
This advantage is particularly pronounced in the MIDOG22 and
HISTOPANTUM datasets. The third-ranking algorithm, ARM
[40], has done relatively worse on the MIDOG22 dataset. Fur-
thermore, the Macenko stain normalization algorithm ranked
6th, outperforming 24 other DG algorithms, but not as good as
StainAug.
All algorithms performed exceptionally well on the CAME-
LYON17 dataset (F1>90%), which can be attributed to the
abundance of data to help the model generalize better and the
relatively simpler nature of the problem. The high performance
across algorithms indicates that the CAMELYON17 dataset
poses fewer challenges in terms of DS. The DS in CAME-
LYON17 is primarily stain variation between different hospi-
tals, making StainAug one of the best candidates to improve
DG in this dataset (as Table 1 shows the highest F1 96.1% for
StainAug).
The tasks associated with the MIDOG22 and HISTOPAN-
TUM datasets are more challenging, involving more significant
domain shifts. Specifically, the performance metrics in the MI-
DOG22 task are generally lower compared to other tasks, re-
flecting the increased difficulty.
Notably, the baseline algorithm, ERM[32], demonstrated
strong performance (ranked 17th), comparable to other SOTA
methods. This suggests that combining simple augmentations
with the ERM approach is sufficient to train a robust classi-
fier. On the other hand, SANDMask [54] and IGA [48] al-
gorithms struggled to converge on the CAMELYON17 and all
datasets, respectively, indicating potential issues in handling
domain shifts or complexities in these tasks.
3.2. Results for Sub-sampled (small) datasets
To investigate how DG algorithms perform under a low-data
budget scenario, we subsample each dataset at different rates
to create smaller datasets (as explained in Section 2.1.4) and
repeat the experiments. The results for these experiments are
reported in Table 2.
Interestingly, SSL and StainAug algorithms are still among
the top 3 performing algorithms with Transfer algorithm [53]
place on the second rank and achieving F1 of 82.8% (almost on
a par with StainAug, F1=82.7%). However, SSL considerably
outperforms other algorithms by gaining the F1 score of 85.4%,
showing an advantage in small-dataset scenarios as has been

shown before for other algorithms based on self-supervised
learning [66].
The majority of SSL superiority is owed to
the performance of sCAMELYON17 and sHISTOPANTUM
datasets.
However, on the hardest DG task using the sMI-
DOG22 dataset, Transfer algorithm [53] gains the highest F1
of 77.9%, considerably outperforming SSL. StainAug does not
perform as high as SSL on sHISTOPANTUM, nevertheless, it
keeps a good performance on sMIDOG22 and sCAMELYON.
On the sHISTOPANTUM dataset, except for the SSL algo-
rithm, most of the other algorithms perform on par.
The baseline ERM algorithm archives impressive results in
the small-scale dataset, outperforming all other algorithms on
the sHISTOPANTUM dataset excluding SSL (F1=87.1%) and
very good performance in the other small datasets. On the other
hand, IGA [48] still struggles to converge on small datasets
whereas the SANDMask [54] algorithm works relatively well
on sCAMELYON17 dataset although it could not converge on
large-scale CAMELYON17 dataset.
3.3. Domain-level performance
We comprehensively evaluate the performance of various al-
gorithms across different domains, the results of which are pre-
sented in Fig. 4 in the form of bar plots. In Fig. 4, each do-
main in every dataset is represented by a uniquely colored bar.
The average performance of all algorithms over each domain
is indicated by horizontal dashed lines in the same color as the
domain. In Fig. 4, algorithms ”IGA” and ”SANDMask” are
excluded due to poor performance and to better visualize the
working performance range of other algorithms.
CAMELYON17. Performance across centers is generally high,
with average F1 scores around 93% to 96%. This is highlighted
by the closely clustered bars and the horizontal dashed lines
at the top of the graph (only a 3.5% difference between the
best and worst domains). Results for CWZ and RUMC cen-
ters are consistently among the highest scores, presumably be-
cause slides from these two centers were scanned using the
same scanner (at RUMC center) and there is a lower domain
shift between these two datasets, hence a model trained on the
data from one of these domains will perform reasonably good

for the other domain too. Furthermore, from Fig. 4B it is evi-
dent that StainAug [58], SD [52], and ERM [32] are among the
most consistent algorithms over different domains whereas the
performance of DAN [42], CDANN [35], CausIRL MMD [56],
and Macenko [60] changes considerably for different CAME-
LYON17 domains.
MIDOG22. In this dataset, performance varies more signifi-
cantly across the different domains (11% difference between
highest and lowest average performance). In particular, based
on the F1 score, the human endocrine cancer is the hardest do-
main (F1=66%) and the canine cutaneous mast cell tumor is
the easiest (F1=77%) for out-of-domain mitosis detection. In-
terestingly, the patterns of different algorithms’ performances
over different domains are similar, i.e., best to worst performing
domains being canine cutaneous mast cell, human breast, ca-
nine lung, canine lymphoma, and human neuroendocrine. The
worst performance on human neuroendocrine can be justified
by three reasons: the tumor type is completely different from
all other domains (class-conditional shift), slides in this do-
main were scanned with a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer XR scan-
ner unlike other datasets that used Aperio or 3DHistech scan-
ners (covariate shift), and the label distribution in this domain
is significantly different from other domains (prior shift). On
the other hand, the performance on the canine cutaneous mast
cell domain is higher because in that case 2 other similar tu-
mor types from the same species and scanner are utilized for
model training, hence model seeing similar data can general-
ize better to this unseen domain. In terms of consistency over
different domains, although the accuracy metric shows consis-
tency for most algorithms (such as SSL in Fig. 4A), F1 score
values tell another story where consistency over different do-
mains drastically decreases for all algorithms. This is mostly
due to an imbalanced class population across different domains
in the MIDOG22 dataset (see Fig. 2B).
HISTOPANTUM. Average accuracy over different domains in
around the same range for CRC, OV, and STAD domains
(around 81%) with a notable accuracy drop for the UCEC do-
main (77%). The F1 score on the UCEC domain is also the
worst among all domains (77% compared to 80-85% for other
domains). This can be accounted for by a prior shift in the
8
label distribution when comparing the UCEC domain with oth-
ers. CRC domain gets the highest performance over because it
shares a similar label distribution and tissue phenotypes appear-
ance (especially with the STAD domain). In HISTOPANTUM,
the SSL algorithm is the best performing and consistent algo-
rithm across all domains, mostly because the utilized SSL al-
gorithm has already seen TCGA slide during its pertaining pro-
cedure. Furthermore, StainAug, ARM [40], CausIRL CORAL
[56] and Transfer [53] algorithms also show decent consistency
and performance over different domains.
4. Discussion
Benchmarking DG algorithms is essential for evaluating their
performance across diverse datasets and scenarios to provide
insights that can increase model robustness in real-world appli-
cations. In this study, we benchmarked various DG algorithms
with different working principles, including SOTA algorithms
from DomainBed collection [22], self-supervised learning [64],
and pathology-specific techniques [60, 58], on datasets with dif-
ferent DS and size properties. Our unified and fair benchmark-
ing process reported both accuracy and F1 scores for compre-
hensive evaluation through robust cross-validation experiments.
At a glance, the average best-performing algorithms are
SSL and StainAug. SSL methods excelled especially on the
HISTOPANTUM dataset, which is the main reason SSL ranked
first in the full-scale dataset (Table 1) and small-scale dataset
(Table 2) scenarios. This is mostly because SSL pertaining was
done on an extensive set of patches extracted from TCGA, the
same source used to curate the HISTOPANTUM dataset. Al-
though the same image patches and labels are not shared be-
tween HISTOPANTUM and the dataset used during pertain-
ing of SSL, the SSL has indirect access to the test data in
HISTOPANTUM and already has seen the possible variation of
image data within HISTOPANTUM. Therefore, the evaluation
of SSL on HISTOPANTUM is more of a “domain adaptation”
exercise rather than “domain generalization” and comparing its
performance (F1=91.7%) with the rest of the algorithms (such
as ARM and StainAug with F1 scores of 88.6% and 87.3%,
respectively) is not fair.
Nevertheless, SSL shows excellent
performance in CAMELYON17, MIDOG22, and the low-data-
budget scenario of the sCAMELYON17 dataset. However, that
is not the case with the sMIDOG22 dataset where there are all
sorts of DS and data shortage problems.
CPath-specific algorithms–stain augmentation (StainAug)
and stain normalization (Macenko)–outperform most complex
DG algorithms in the literature while being simple and easy
to implement. In particular, StainAug excelled in the CAME-
LYON17 and MIDOG22 datasets. StainAug helps the model
to learn more stain-invariant feature representations from the
image during the training by randomly tweaking the stain in-
formation on the fly.
Considering stain variation as a con-
founding factor, StainAug can be thought of as a causal ap-
proach for DG in CPath as it helps to learn features that are
irrelevant to stain variation, hence achieving outstanding re-
sults on the CAMELYON17 dataset where the main DS is co-
variate shift (or changes in stain appearance). Macenko stain
normalization algorithm has also shined in the CAMELYON17
and HISTOPANTUM tasks where stain variation is the domi-
nant DS. Specifically, in the small dataset scenario of sCAME-
LYON, Macenko outperforms all other algorithms (except SSL)
and ranks second. However, we should note that stain normal-
ization methods add another preprocessing step to every CPath
pipeline that uses them and sometimes are not stable in practice
[67, 18]. Therefore, we suggest using stain augmentation over
stain normalization when training models on H&E images.
To gain a deeper understanding of how algorithm perfor-
mance varies between small and full dataset regimes, we plot
their rankings based on F1 and Accuracy metrics over small
and full datasets in Fig. 5. Each point on the plot represents an
algorithm, with its x-axis position indicating its rank in the full
dataset regime and its y-axis position indicating its rank in the
small dataset regime. The color of each point reflects the per-
formance difference between the two dataset sizes. Algorithms
located along the diagonal line performed similarly in both the
full and small dataset regimes. Examples of such algorithms
based on F1 score in Fig. 5 include SSL [64], StainAug [58],
Macenko [60], ANDMask [36], EQRM [51], and RSC [46]
among others. Conversely, some algorithms showed improved
performance rankings on smaller datasets, evident from their
positions below the diagonal line. Notable examples include
Transfer [53], VREx [49], and SagNet [43]. Ideally, algorithms
that are versatile and perform consistently across different data
conditions are desirable. Therefore, algorithms close to the di-
agonal line and lower left corner of plots in Fig. 5 (such as SSL
and StainAug) are more suitable ones to investigate regardless
of the size of the dataset at hand.
As mentioned before, in CAMELYON17 and HISTOPAN-
TUM, most algorithms perform well due to the large amount of
data and simpler domain shifts. However, the level of perfor-
mance for all algorithms drops on MIDOG22, which encom-
passes all kinds of DS. In the large-scale MIDOG22 dataset,
SSL and StainAug showed the best performance in terms of
F1 score, whereas in the small-scale sMIDOG22 dataset, SSL
is not among the top-performing algorithms. Instead, Transfer
[53] and SD [52] algorithms achieve high F1 scores along with
StainAug. Alternatively, focusing on the accuracy metrics ob-
tained for the MIDOG22 dataset, we can see that the EQRM
algorithm [51] is very promising. Although we have found that
SSL and StainAug are generally good options to consider for
DG applications, there is no one “best” algorithm that fits all
the situations. Depending on the dataset size, the types of DS
in the dataset, and the difficulty of the task different DG algo-
rithms can perform differently.
Notably, the baseline ERM algorithm [32] (which simply
uses data from different domains in the mini-batches with stan-
dard data augmentation during training) performed consistently
better than most DG algorithms, indicating that simple meth-
ods can be effective if implemented properly. This is in line
with the findings of other works that investigated various DG
algorithms [68, 22]. This underscores the importance of careful
experiment design and incorporating well-performing baseline
algorithms when looking for an optimal DG algorithm in any
application.

4.1. DG guidelines
While we cannot pinpoint a single best algorithm for all
scenarios, we can suggest general guidelines that help narrow
down the number of DG algorithms to investigate for a spe-
cific application. First and foremost, ensure that the experi-
ments are designed properly. For example, if cross-validation
is implemented, make sure there is no data leakage and use
domain-level stratification of cases between the train and test
sets. Then, it is recommended to fine-tune a pretrained model
(such as SSL [64]), instead of learning from scratch or start-
ing with ImageNet weights. Furthermore, implementing data
augmentation as much as possible is recommended, especially
modality-specific techniques such as stain augmentation (or at
least HSV color augmentation) and generic data augmentation
techniques (like image blurring, rotation, etc.). Incorporating
augmentations has been shown to improve the generalizability
of the model in many studies [69, 63, 70, 71, 10, 58, 72, 73] by
learning more robust feature representations that are invariant
to confounding factors such as stain, sharpness, or rotations of
the images.

Figure 5: Comparative analysis of algorithm performance in small vs. full dataset regimes, showcasing Accuracy (A) and F1 score (B) metrics. The plots illustrate
how each algorithm’s effectiveness varies with dataset size. Algorithms close to the bottom-left corner are desirable.
After that, if desirable results are not achieved, a combina-
tion of the following algorithms can be investigated in con-
junction with the suggested techniques above:
ARM [40],
CausIRL CORAL [56], Transfer [53], and EQRM [51]. These
algorithms have shown promise for DG and a high likelihood of
convergence, and are less sensitive to parameter selection. On
the other hand, based on our experience, investigation of IGA
[48] and SANDMask [54] can be ignored due to their sensitiv-
ity to parameter selection and low likelihood of convergence in
CPath applications. For more universal guidelines on how to
achieve DG in CPath, please refer to [18].
4.2. Limitations
This study uses a ResNet50 model [30] as the feature extrac-
tor with all DG algorithms. While ResNet50 is known for its ro-
bust performance in various tasks, the choice of model capacity
and architecture can have a significant impact on the generaliz-
ability [74, 75]. A larger or alternative model architecture could
potentially enhance performance. Our focus is specifically on
the DG algorithm and the ResNet model due to its properties
is considered to be well-suited for this study. Furthermore, one
of the best-performing algorithms is SSL which is a ResNet50
model pretrained on TCGA image patches [64]. However, there
are many more recent foundation models released for CPath
that have shown DG capability [76, 77, 78, 79]. We could not
include any of these models as a DG algorithm in our com-
parison due to their considerable difference in model size and
architecture from other algorithms, however, we expect that re-
placing the SSL [64] with foundation models and also using
them in conjunction with other recommended DG algorithms
may further improve the results. This is an interesting question
to investigate in future foundation model research areas.
Furthermore, despite our efforts to determine the optimal
working range for each algorithm, there remains the possibil-
ity that further tuning could yield improved performance. The
results presented should be considered as initial findings from
an out-of-the-box application of these methods. Future work
could explore additional parameter adjustments to refine per-
formance and potentially achieve better outcomes for some of
the algorithms.
Admittedly, all of our benchmarking tasks are restricted to
binary classification tasks. This choice is made to maintain a
clear and focused evaluation framework, and also due to the
limited availability of multi-labeled datasets. Moreover, this
study does not explore other machine-learning tasks, such as se-
mantic segmentation or bounding-box detection. This is partly
because most DG algorithms have been tailored toward clas-
sification tasks. Although there are some DG algorithms sug-
gested for other applications [18], it is hard to benchmark them
mostly because there is no suitable platform or dataset in CPath
to enable it. Nevertheless, investigating these additional tasks
could reveal how the DG algorithms perform across a broader
range of applications and potentially uncover different insights
or challenges.
5. Conclusions
This study reports a comprehensive benchmarking of vari-
ous domain generalization algorithms on three diverse compu-
tational pathology tasks. We evaluated 30 algorithms, includ-
ing SOTA methods, self-supervised learning, and pathology-
specific techniques, using a robust cross-validation framework.
Our findings reveal that self-supervised learning and stain aug-
mentation were consistently among the best-performing algo-
rithms, emphasizing their effectiveness in addressing domain
shifts. The baseline ERM algorithm also demonstrated compet-
itive performance, highlighting the importance of careful exper-
iment design and proper implementation of baseline algorithms.
The results underscore that no single “best DG algorithm”
exists for all scenarios. The choice of the DG algorithm should
be guided by factors like dataset size and diversity, domain
shift types, and task complexity. Nevertheless, our study of-
fers recommendations that may be useful for selecting effective
DG strategies in CPath. We suggest fine-tuning a pretrained
11
model, incorporating stain augmentation, and considering algo-
rithms like ARM [40], CausIRL CORAL [56], Transfer [53],
and EQRM [51] for optimal performance. We hope that this
study will trigger further development of robust and generaliz-
able deep learning models for CPath applications.
