Abstract
This review examines current and potential applications of DTs in healthcare, focusing on the
integration of multi-omics data using multilayer network approaches in cancer research. We
discuss
methodologies,
tools
and
platforms commonly used for this integration, while
highlighting case studies, challenges, and research gaps. Finally, we advocate the need for
incorporating diverse data types to produce more effective DTs for personalization of cancer
treatments and in silico clinical trials.
Background
The emergence of precision medicine has shown the necessity to have integrative approaches
that can exploit the vast and complex datasets generated by multi-omics technologies. These
technologies,
including
(epi)genomics,
transcriptomics,
proteomics,
metabolomics,
metagenomics and other techniques that exhaustively characterize specific sets of biological
entities, provides a comprehensive view of biological systems at multiple levels of regulation.
Integrating these diverse types of datasets is essential to have a comprehensive digital
representation of patients and identifying novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets (Hasin et al.,
2017), especially in cancer, which will be the focus of this review.
Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in healthcare, providing
dynamic, in silico models of cells, organs, or entire organisms that are continuously updated
with real-time data. These virtual counterparts enable predictive modeling and personalized
interventions (Kamel Boulos & Zhang, 2021). DTs leverage advanced computational techniques
to integrate and analyze large-scale multi-omics data to implement precision oncology. A key
feature of DTs is their use of network-based representations that span multiple scales and
layers of biological information, often realized through multilayer networks. Multilayer networks
1
(Kivela et al., 2014) have gained popularity for their ability to model complex systems where
entities interact across multiple layers or dimensions. In the context of multi-omics data
integration, these multilayer networks can represent different types of biological information as
interconnected layers to capture the relationships and interactions between genes, proteins,
metabolites and other molecular entities (De Domenico, 2023; Trimbour et al., 2024), enabling
the identification of crucial regulatory mechanisms and pathways that may remain elusive in
single-layer network analyses (De Domenico, Lancichinetti, et al., 2015). Multilayer networks
can be thought of as a mathematical foundation of knowledge graphs (Baptista et al., 2024).
Despite the potential of DTs and multilayer networks, several conceptual and practical
challenges in their implementation persist, including the intrinsic heterogeneous nature of
multi-omics datasets, requiring elaborated algorithms and substantial computational resources.
Ensuring data quality or consistency remains a significant obstacle. Moreover, the development
of reliable DTs requires robust validation methods to ensure that their predictive capabilities
align with real-world outcomes (Hernandez-Boussard et al., 2021).
Digital Twins in precision health
Definition and concept
By offering opportunities for individualized healthcare through virtual models, DTs represent a
paradigm shift in the field of precision health and personalized medicine. In healthcare, DTs can
be defined as highly detailed and dynamic virtual replicas of physical entities (cells, tissues,
organs, patients and health systems), reproducing the structure, behavior and context of the
physical counterpart (Qi et al., 2021). These virtual counterparts are continuously updated with
real-time
data
to
simulate
and
predict
health
outcomes,
thereby
optimizing
clinical
decision-making (Fuller et al., 2020). DTs integrate data from multiple sources in real-time to
simulate health outcomes and can be adapted to each patient, potentially increasing proactive
healthcare management by enabling more precise, timely and effective clinical interventions,
ultimately improving patient treatment efficiency.
Beyond computational models, DTs are not limited to simple static digital models; they involve a
bidirectional flow of information between the physical entity and its digital counterpart, ensuring
that the virtual model evolves at the same time as its real-world counterpart. This continuous
synchronization enables DTs to reflect the actual current state of the physical entity accurately,
as well as predict future states under various scenarios (Kamel Boulos & Zhang, 2021). For
instance, in clinical setting, DTs of a patient would integrate data from various sources (clinical
records, genetic data, lifestyle information, real-time monitoring from wearable devices, …) to
provide a comprehensive dynamic representation of the patient’s health status and guide
recommendations for therapeutic interventions or increased surveillance (Figure 1).
The effectiveness of DTs depends on their predictive capability (Fuller et al., 2020). Leveraging
real-time data and historical health information helps DTs forecast various factors such as
disease
progression,
outcomes of different treatment options or early signs of health
deterioration. This predictive capability is particularly valuable in the management of chronic
diseases, where early intervention can significantly influence disease progression. DTs can be
2
used not only for improving disease treatments, but also for preventing their onset and
mitigating their impact. Their predictive power comes from modeling disease trajectories, i.e.
mapping a disease's progression over time, including its onset, development and chronicity,
when relevant, starting from clinical records, multi-omics data and real-time health metrics.
Therefore, they offer the potential for medical professionals to proactively adjust treatment
plans, and anticipate significant turning points in the disease's course. They can also be used to
provide alerts for early indicators of health deterioration for chronic diseases, whose trajectory
frequently includes periods of remission or relapse.
Figure 1: Conceptual diagram of DTs in the context of cancer research.
Moreover, the DTs framework can help in the creation of a learning healthcare system where
continuous feedback from DTs informs clinical decisions and enhances healthcare delivery. This
iterative process not only improves individual patient care, but also contributes to the broader
knowledge base, driving key advancements in medical research and clinical practice (Kamel
Boulos & Zhang, 2021).
Potential applications in healthcare
Personalized medicine and disease management are a few of the areas in which DTs are
gaining recognition for their transformative potential in the healthcare industry. Several existing
systems integrate multi-omics data with clinical and lifestyle information to create a more
complete and individualized health profile that can serve as a basis for in silico disease
modeling. These models can form the basis for clinical decision support systems, providing
predictions of responses to the different treatment options, a highly valuable tool for clinicians
3
who can tailor interventions based on the unique characteristics of each patient. In addition, DTs
enable customized interventions by utilizing real-time data to offer precise and dynamic insights
into patient health but they involve continuous mapping of the physical and digital counterparts.
Virtual representations play an important role in the prevention and management of chronic
disease. The constant monitoring of physiological data allows DTs to identify early signs of
disease onset but also aggravation, which is crucial for timely intervention. In the context of
diabetes management, DTs have demonstrated the capacity to predict glucose fluctuations by
integrating data on dietary intake, physical activity or medication adherence, making it a
powerful tool to help clinicians with better management of the disease and preventing
complications (Shamanna et al., 2021). Recently, this has led to the design of DT systems that
inject insulin through real-time monitoring of patient glucose levels (Thamotharan et al., 2023).
Other studies in cardiovascular health demonstrate how DTs can monitor vital or relevant
cardiovascular signs (resting heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure) to detect
abnormalities at an early stage and suggest preventive measures (Coorey et al., 2022).
Specifically in oncology, advanced computational frameworks have proven useful to model
tumor growth and predict how a tumor will respond to different therapeutic interventions
(Benzekry et al., 2014) leading to optimization of cancer patient treatment plans by improving
drug effectiveness and minimizing side effects (Bruynseels et al., 2018).
Only a few real DTs for oncology have been developed, also due to the difficulty of dynamically
adapting treatments. Some studies demonstrated a significant increase in treatment efficacy
that shows the potential of DTs in adapting cancer therapies, each simulation predicting a
trajectory for the patient’s cancer under one of the treatment options (Hernandez-Boussard et
al., 2021). Additional examples of oncological DTs are reviewed in (Stahlberg et al., 2022),
illustrating the limits but also the potential of DTs to improve early diagnosis of cancers that are
generally detected at advanced stages. One pilot project generated virtual patients for early
detection of pancreatic cancer. Subtle changes in biomarker profiles could be detected at an
early stage, which is indicative of early pancreatic cancer. However, matching real patients in
the cohort with simulated patients from the model did not result in a definitive mapping between
real-world data and model parameters. Another project involved using simulations of cellular
interactions in the tumor to personalize melanoma treatment.
Another remarkable application predicts drug efficacy in lung cancer using DTs. DTs models
allow the simulation of different delivery methods and dosages under different therapeutic
scenarios to establish treatment efficacy. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for
clinicians to be able to adjust treatment plans as a therapeutic or preventive measure (Vallée,
2024). Some studies also underscored the DTs value in the anticipation of treatment response
in cancer therapy (Venkatesh et al., 2024).
On the other side, further from real patients, testing new drugs or treatments via virtual platforms
is an application of DTs that is transforming drug discovery. The simulation of biological
processes and disease progression is implemented in DTs to predict the interaction of new
compounds with different molecular targets, observing how it will perform in simulated diverse
4
patient populations constituting virtual cohorts (H. Wang et al., 2024). This approach reduces
the need for extensive in vivo testing, improving the drug development process. DTs could also
play a major role in patient education by improving their own awareness, and pushing them to
be proactive about their health. If an interactive representation of health status via Patient
Reported Outcomes and the impact of different lifestyle choices is provided to patients, DTs
could indirectly enhance motivation for self-management. For instance, DTs can show some
patients with obesity the impact of weight loss on some health metrics, encouraging changes in
diet and exercise regimens (Gkouskou et al., 2020).
In conclusion, the applications of DTs in healthcare are broad: personalized medicine, disease
prevention/management, drug discovery and patient engagement. The integration of real-time
data by DTs offers dynamic insights that ameliorate personalized healthcare. As the technology
continues to evolve, the potential of these DTs in improving healthcare outcomes should
continue to grow, highlighting their importance in the future of precision health (Fuller et al.,
2020; Kamel Boulos & Zhang, 2021). Literature examples reveal the potential of dynamic and
predictive models to improve early detection, personalize treatment strategies or therapeutic
resistance anticipation. However, the development of tools that enable feedback between the
DT and real patients is still in progress (Fuller et al., 2020), holding promise in cancer research.
Challenges and opportunities in the integration of multi-omics data in
cancer research
A full comprehension of molecular mechanisms driving cancer progression is made possible by
the integration of multi-omics data, which has become an essential component in oncology. The
word "omics" refers to a group of scientific areas, each of which focuses on specific biological
entities
(Srivastava
et
al.,
2024).
Genomics,
epigenomics,
transcriptomics, proteomics,
metabolomics, metagenomics and even radiomics (medical imaging such as MRI, CT scans, …)
are the main categories of data that are important for cancer research. We give an overview of
different types of ‘omics data, their general characteristics and relevance to cancer research in
Table 1.
The integration of multi-omics data in oncology offers significant potential to advance the
understanding of cancer biology. However, several significant challenges must be addressed to
fully realize its potential. These challenges include technical, computational and biological
nature, as well as data administration policies, while also presenting unique opportunities for
innovation.
One of the main challenges in multi-omics integration is the inherent heterogeneity of the data,
stemming from both its nature and its method of generation. Different ‘omics data sources are
generated using diverse technologies, each having its own data formats (Cao et al., 2021; Ren
et al., 2023), indicating the necessity for a deeper investigation of the crosstalk between
different levels of data granularity (Cirillo et al., 2021). This inconsistency adds complexity to the
integration process because the harmonization and standardization of these datasets require
advanced methodologies (Hasin et al., 2017).

The high volume of multi-omics data requires efficient algorithms for extracting useful and
interpretable
information.
Also,
this
high-dimensional
data integration involves handling
large-scale datasets that demand high computational power as well as scalable storage
capacity (Nikolski et al., 2024). Moreover, the development of efficient algorithms for the
different steps of data processing (preprocessing, normalization and integration) is crucial to
managing this complexity (Santiago-Rodriguez & Hollister, 2021). Machine learning (ML) or
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly employed to address these challenges but
their implementation needs substantial expertise and resources (Angermueller et al., 2016;
Libbrecht & Noble, 2015). Ensuring data quality and reproducibility is another significant
challenge. ‘Omics data can be affected by various technical issues at different steps of the
experiments or analysis pipeline (technical biases, batch effects, sample-specific variations, …)
which can hide biological signals and lead to false conclusions (Leek et al., 2010). Therefore,
rigorous quality control measures, standardized protocols and reproducible workflows are
essential to mitigate all these issues. Additionally, the integration process must account for
missing data and varying sample sizes across different ‘omics layers (Kim et al., 2005).
Complex datasets are generated by the integration of multi-omics data, which requires careful
interpretation to derive biologically meaningful insights. For instance, the identification of key
drivers in cancer and the elucidation of their functional roles in the context of multi-omics data is
an important and challenging task. Distinguishing true biological signals from noise and
correlating multi-omics findings with clinical outcomes are the true challenges. Collaborative
efforts between researchers and clinicians are essential to contextualize the results and then
translate them into actionable knowledge (Demirel et al., 2022).
Despite all these challenges, the integration of multi-omics data currently offers substantial
opportunities to deepen our understanding of cancer biology in the tumor site and across the
whole organism. The combination of information from several types of ‘omics data can bring an
extensive view of the molecular mechanisms that drive tumor growth via different types of data
integration (S. Huang et al., 2017) (Figure 2). This global approach helps to identify new
biomarkers that may not be apparent from single-omics studies alone, with some methods
taking into consideration data type diversity and big data volume (D. Wu et al., 2015).
Significant potential in personalized medicine and great progress can be achieved thanks to
multi-omics integration. The detailed molecular profiling of individual tumors is adequate to
reveal patient-specific vulnerabilities, thus designing customized therapeutic strategies for the
patients (Collins & Varmus, 2015). For instance, integrating genomic and transcriptomic data is
interesting to identify actionable mutations or dysregulated pathways, while proteomic and
metabolomic analyses can improve our understanding of tumor metabolism alterations (Gegner
et al., 2023; W. Zhang & Plevritis, 2018).

strategies (treatment or prevention).
Developing novel algorithms or ML models to handle high-dimensional, heterogeneous data is
another emergent area of research (C. Wu et al., 2019). These advancements not only improve
the performance (efficiency and accuracy) of data integration but also contribute in a broader
way to the field of computational biology. The complexity of the integration makes collaborative
efforts

necessary
(Gómez-López et al., 2019). Some initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
(Weinstein et al., 2013), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) (J. Zhang et al.,
2011) and Human Cell Atlas (HCA) (Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2017) provide highly valuable
resources and infrastructure for multi-omics research. Some recent resources are specific to
certain types of ‘omics data such as the Human Protein Atlas (Pontén et al., 2008) (proteomics),
International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) (Stunnenberg et al., 2016) (epigenomics)
or Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) (Wishart et al., 2007) (metabolomics). These
collaborative platforms are excellent for the exchange of data, tools or expertise, accelerating
scientific discoveries and clinical translation.
Multilayer network approaches for multi-omics integration
Fundamentals of multilayer networks
Multilayer networks are a powerful framework to model complex systems characterized by
multiple types of interactions (or relationships). Unlike traditional single-layer networks which
represent a single type of interaction among molecular entities, multilayer networks incorporate
multiple interconnected layers, where each of them represents a different type of relationship,
capturing the multifaceted nature of real-world interactions (De Domenico, 2022; Kivela et al.,
2014). More specifically, a multilayer network is formally defined by a set of nodes and layers,
where each node can exist in one or more layers, while edges represent the connections
between nodes within the same layer (intra-layer edges) or across different layers (inter-layer
edges) (Figure 3). The interconnections between the different layers (inter-layer edges) are key
8
elements in the network to understand the influence of different types of interactions and the
impact on the overall dynamics of the system.
Figure 3: Schematic representation of multilayer and multiplex networks. On the left, a
multilayer network showing intra- and inter-layer connections. On the right we represent a
special case of multilayer, a multiplex network, in which the nodes are the same in all layers.
One of the main advantages of multilayer networks, compared to single-layer networks, comes
from their ability to model interdependencies between different types of data. In system biology
research, a multilayer network can simultaneously represent genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic
and clinical data, each as a distinct layer. The interactions within each layer are able to capture
relationships specific to that data type, such as transcription factors (TFs) - target genes (TGs)
regulatory interactions in the transcriptomic layer or protein-protein interactions (PPI) in the
proteomic layer. On the other hand, inter-layer edges capture the relationships between different
data types (De Domenico, 2018). The construction of multilayer networks involves several
methodological steps:
1.
Data preprocessing to ensure compatibility: Ensures consistency across 'omics
datasets, involving quality control, noise reduction, and standardization. Batch effect
removal and data imputation address technical biases and missing values, to accurately
reflect biological variability (Lazar et al., 2013; Leek et al., 2010).
2.
Single-layer network reconstruction: For each ‘omics type, individual single-layer
networks
are
constructed,
based
on
annotated
interactions
such
as
TF-target
interactions, PPI, or metabolic pathways. Algorithms tailored to each data type can
establish connections indicating correlation, causality, or interaction strength, with edge
direction or weight based on interaction type and confidence.
3.
Integration into the multilayer network: Single-layer networks are integrated into a
multilayer network via inter-layer edges, representing cross-‘omics interactions, i.e.
regulatory relationships between genes and proteins, or other molecular entities. Several
approaches can be used to define inter-layer edges, including data-driven methods that
infer relationships based on statistical correlations or ML models that predict interactions
based on prior knowledge of biological principles. A special case of multilayer networks
is obtained when all nodes are present in all layers denoted as multiplex networks,
9
where distinct layers represent different interaction types for the same set of nodes,
preserving the individual network topologies (Kivela et al., 2014; Valdeolivas et al.,
2019).
The visualization of the constructed network can be done using ad hoc developed tools, or
extensions of other tools initially built for single-layer networks visualization, which we
summarize in Table 2.

Analysis of multilayer networks
The advancement of computational tools, algorithms and graph-based methods is essential to
analyze multilayer networks and interpret their features. One approach is the use of centrality
measures to determine the importance of nodes within the multilayer network. Frequently used
centrality measures for single-layer networks (gene degree, betweenness centrality, alpha
centrality, …) are extended to consider the multilayer context, offering the opportunity to find
nodes that play a major role across multiple layers (De Domenico, Lancichinetti, et al., 2015).
Another essential technique is community detection, an analytical technique which involves
node cluster (or community) identification; these nodes are densely connected amongst each
other within and across layers compared to the connections they have with other nodes not in
the community. It helps to reveal functional modules that work together in a coordinated way in
several contexts (Didier et al., 2015; Mucha et al., 2010), particularly in complex diseases
(Choobdar et al., 2019; Halu et al., 2019). Additionally, examining multilayer motifs means
looking at small recurring patterns of interconnections that occur within and between layers of
the network. These motifs establish the fundamental building blocks of the network's structure
(Boccaletti et al., 2014). More advanced concepts, such as the Von Neumann entropy of a
multilayer network, can be utilized to characterize global connectivity patterns across layers (De
Domenico, Nicosia, et al., 2015). Studying network dynamics is also interesting to understand
10
how information propagates through the multilayer network (a phenomenon called flow) via
modeling the spread of perturbations and understanding how interactions in one layer affect
dynamics in other ones (De Domenico et al., 2016; Gómez et al., 2013). One of the most used
for this purpose approach is Random Walk with Restart, which identifies relationships between
nodes, reconstructs communities, and predicts key interactions (Baptista et al., 2024; Cowen et
al., 2017).
Machine learning and predictive modeling
ML techniques are increasingly applied to multilayer networks to develop predictive models.
Supervised learning algorithms, like support vector machines (SVM) or random forests (RF),
can be trained on multilayer network features to predict clinical outcomes or response to therapy
(Libbrecht & Noble, 2015). Unsupervised learning methods (clustering or dimensionality
reduction) can help to discover new patterns or possibly some associations within the integrated
data (C. Wu et al., 2019). Predictive modeling using multilayer networks enhances the ability to
make data-driven decisions in personalized cancer treatment.
Network embedding approaches are also effective in analyzing a wide range of networks, even
if they were not originally developed for biological networks (Parvizi et al., 2022). These
methods have shown good performance in tasks like community detection, node classification
and link prediction. However, most embedding methods are not designed to be applied on
multiplex networks. To address this, advanced methods like MultiVERSE have been developed;
it has demonstrated superior performance in tasks such as link prediction and network
reconstruction, particularly in multiplex networks (Pio-Lopez et al., 2021).
With the ability to learn complex relationships and inherent structures in multilayer networks,
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are highly effective at analyzing graph-structured data (Corso et
al., 2024). They encode both the node features and the graph topology into low-dimensional
embeddings; these embeddings can then be used for a variety of tasks, such as node
classification
and
link
prediction
(M.
Zhang,
2022).
Latest
advancements,
like Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) enhance the capacity to
represent heterogeneous data and facilitate uses such as link prediction applied to drug target
prediction (Chatzianastasis et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Grassia et al., 2021; K. Huang et al.,
2024).
Applications of multilayer networks in data integration
Data integration based on multilayer networks is performed by the inference or construction of
integrated
networks
that
combine
multi-omics
(genomic,
transcriptomic,
proteomic,
metabolomic, etc.) data. This all-around approach is ideal to map the interactions between
different molecular entities across various biological layers, leading to a multidimensional view
of cellular processes. We can consider that genomic data can reveal mutations in cancer-related
genes, while transcriptomic data can show how these mutations affect gene expression levels.
Integrating these datasets into a multilayer network (Trimbour et al., 2024) could be a way to
establish the influence of genetic alterations on transcriptional changes and possibly the
propagation of these changes through proteomic and metabolomic layers.

approaches employing multilayers have also been applied to the study of specific pathologies,
such as infection by Sars-Cov-2 (Verstraete et al., 2020).
In cancer research, significant benefits emerge from the application of multilayer network theory,
with the central one coming from the integration of diverse types of biological data that enhance
the view of the molecular mechanisms driving tumors. This integrative approach can help to
identify key regulatory pathways and potential therapeutic targets that might be overlooked in
single-layer analyses. Overall, multilayer networks can help to interpret the complex interplay
between genetics and environment (genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications, environmental
factors, …) in cancer evolution.
Digital Twins for cancer research: a multilayer network perspective
Conceptual framework
The conceptual framework for utilizing DTs in oncology through a multilayer network perspective
covers a systematic approach that integrates diverse types of biological data to create predictive
models of tumors. This framework leverages the positive aspects of multilayer network theory to
deliver a more complete representation of the biological processes and molecular functions
involved in cancer progression (Laubenbacher et al., 2022). In the following sections, we
consider the multilayer network as the scaffold of a patient DT and give a roadmap of how to
build it by integrating multi-omics data, as well as how to use it in cancer research.
Integration of multi-omics data
The integration of multi-omics data is the central area of this conceptual framework, which can
include genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and eventually
other data types like clinical data (e.g. histopathology images), generated from tumor samples,
as well as data regarding the host (metagenomics of the microbiome, exposomics etc). Each of
these layers brings unique and complementary insights into the different aspects of cancer.
Clinical implementation and validation
The final step in the framework corresponds to the clinical implementation and validation of the
DT, a challenging but primordial task for the technology to gain credibility. In this context, two
different concepts exist. The first one corresponds to the integration of DTs into clinical
workflows where they can assist oncologists in the decision-making process with data-driven
choices regarding diagnosis, prognosis or treatment (clinical decision support systems). The
second one is based on the use of DTs to perform virtual clinical trials, testing the efficacy of
new compounds or even drug associations in a virtual environment before applying them to
patients to limit the risk (H. Wang et al., 2024).
Validation of DTs’ predictive capabilities is indispensable to ascertain their reliability. Some
retrospective analysis using historical patient data, as well as prospective validation in clinical
12
trials can be performed. Continuous monitoring and updating of DTs with dynamic, more recent
patient data reinforce the accuracy and confirm the effectiveness of the tool for cancer
management (Hernandez-Boussard et al., 2021).
Practical Challenges in DT implementation
Research gaps
The availability of longitudinal data to capture the dynamic nature of tumor progression is a
significant challenge. This causes a limited understanding of temporal dynamics in cancer
progression or even treatment response. The continuous monitoring and data acquisition in
real-time from patients involves the integration of clinical, imaging or wearable device data, as
well as, potentially, patient-reported outcomes, with multi-omics profiles (Chow et al., 2024).
Achieving this level of integration requires advanced data management systems that are
capable of handling diverse data flows but also maintaining temporal consistency.
A very important issue that should not be neglected is the use of sensitive personal health
information (privacy, consent, data ownership) because it raises some privacy and security
concerns. Among them, protecting patient data from unauthorized access is critical as data
breaches can lead to potentially severe consequences like identity theft or loss of trust in
healthcare systems (Rothstein, 2015; Thapa & Camtepe, 2021). Data privacy should be made a
priority by implementing stringent data governance policies to protect patient information.
Techniques such as differential privacy, which adds noise to datasets to prevent the
identification of individuals are more and more employed to protect patient confidentiality while
allowing data analysis (Dwork & Roth, 2014). More recent solutions are promising like
blockchain, which offers a decentralized and immutable ledger that can be used to securely
store/share patient data (Pournaghi et al., 2020), or homomorphic encryption, allowing
computations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first (Munjal & Bhatia, 2023).
Security measures must also address the risk of cyber-attacks with the implementation of robust
cybersecurity protocols (regular security audits, intrusion detection systems, secure access
controls, …) which is essential to protect multi-omics data and DT models from hostile attacks
(Fernández-Alemán et al., 2013).
The biological interpretation of integrated multi-omics data is another research gap. While
multilayer networks can reveal complex interactions, translating these findings into concrete
biological insights remains a challenge (Demirel et al., 2022). There is a need for other tools to
interpret the results of multilayer network analyses in not only a technically and biologically
meaningful way. In addition, experimental validation of the predictions made by DTs is
necessary to confirm different parameters like accuracy or utility in clinical settings.
Data collection and AI
The adoption of DTs in precision medicine is increasingly operational, driven by extensive data
collection alongside traditional biomedical methodologies. However, the reliance on black-box
predictive models based on large datasets presents limitations that could potentially slow down
the broader application of DTs in clinical settings. In the literature, it has been argued that
13
hypothesis-driven generative models (generate data based on a set of underlying assumptions
of the processes that generate the observed data), more particularly multi-scale modeling, are
essential to boost the clinical accuracy of DTs. The transformative potential of DTs in healthcare
has been explored by emphasizing their capability to simulate complex interdependent
biological processes across multiple scales. The integration of generative models with extensive
datasets can deliver scenario-based modeling approaches to explore diverse therapeutic
strategies. It is an excellent strategy to support dynamic clinical decision-making. This method
not only leverages advancements in data science to improve disease management but also
incorporates insights from complex systems, quantitative biology and digital medicine to improve
patient care (De Domenico et al., 2024).
Perspectives
In the context of cancer, multilayer networks have been used to capture complex interactions,
leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets (Liu et al., 2020). The integration of gene
expression data with chromatin accessibility and protein-protein interaction networks was shown
to uncover key regulatory proteins that are central to tumor progression, which might not be
clearly identified when examining single-layer networks, highlighting the added value of a
multilayer approach to propose new biomarkers.
Given the importance of the TME in affecting tumor progression and therapy response (Quail &
Joyce, 2013), it is imperative to explore the integration of information regarding all cellular
populations within a sample into predictive models. This process requires the non-trivial
development of new methods that capture salient information from either estimation of cell type
proportions from bulk RNAseq (Merotto et al., 2024) or from single-cell spatial and non-spatial
datasets. It is likely that new modes of dimensionality reduction will have to be applied to these
types of data to produce correspondences between these omics and more traditional layers, in
which nodes are molecular entities.
In fact, multi-level and hybrid models will probably become necessary to use the multilayer
structures beyond simple data integration and towards dynamic modeling. Despite the obvious
interest of analyzing the integrated datasets on this multilayer structure, looking for communities
spanning several layers, for example, the real power of this framework will come from the
construction of dynamic models of these complex systems. A first approximation of dynamics
can be provided by flow analyses on the network, which simulate how the information will
spread within and across layers, providing an idea of perturbations that can move the DT into a
required state (for instance towards a healthy state). Simulating the dynamic state of a patient,
including the tumor itself, the immune system, different organs and how the patient environment
is impacting all of them will probably require a combination of models of different scales (e.g.
molecular, metabolic, cellular, etc.) as well as a better understanding of regulation and
correspondence between nodes in different layers. Further down the line, with a better
understanding of the underlying multi-level biological processes, we might be able to construct
executable models comprising the entire variety of datasets, constituting DTs that will be
extremely useful for in-silico clinical trials that consider the patient as a whole.
14
Several approaches to modeling the TME have been proposed (Johnson et al., 2023) and these
might enable a dynamic perspective, essential to understanding the adaptation of cancer cells
to therapeutic molecules at the tumor site. More effective treatment strategies might require
combinations of different approaches at different times, requiring a good understanding of the
time scales of the different biological processes involved in cancer (Z. Wang & Deisboeck,
2019). To move closer to virtual clinical trials, a more complete representation of patients would
be required. The flexibility of the multilayer approach should enable this by allowing the
integration of even more diverse data types. For instance, integrating prior comorbidities could
be of great value in predicting patient outcomes, as was the case for predicting pancreatic
cancer onset (Placido et al., 2023). Indeed patient comorbidity profiles might work as proxies for
identifying patient characteristics that are relevant for patient stratification (Sánchez-Valle et al.,
2020), while integrating exposures or side effects with tumor characteristics via multi-layer
networks and multi-level models could produce more useful DTs for drug discovery and
development in in silico clinical trials.
Conclusion
This review has examined the methodologies, tools and challenges in the implementation of
DTs for cancer by their potential to provide a comprehensive view of tumor biology, a central
element in cancer research for precise predictions of disease progression, response to
treatment and side effects. Despite the hopes in DTs, some challenges (data integration,
computational efficiency or data privacy) need to be faced. Future research should focus on
developing
computational
models
and
enhancing
scalability
without
neglecting
ethical
frameworks for patient data use. Collaboration between industrialists, clinicians and researchers
could help overcome these challenges. DTs offer opportunities to transform cancer care with
more effective and individualized treatments by providing broad dynamic models of cancer.
Further advancements in this field, with the integration of more patient-level data, are crucial,
holding the promise of enabling better in silico clinical trials and accelerating cancer treatment
development.
