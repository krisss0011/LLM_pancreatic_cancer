Abstract 
 
Background: AI-based classification models are essential for improving lung cancer diagnosis. However, 
the relative performance of lesion-level versus chest-region models in internal and external datasets remains 
unclear. 
Purpose: This study evaluates the performance of lesion-level and chest-region models for lung cancer 
classification, comparing their effectiveness across internal Duke Lung Nodule Dataset 2024 (DLND24) 
and external (LUNA16, NLST) datasets, with a focus on subgroup analyses by demographics, histology, 
and imaging characteristics. 
Materials and Methods: Two AI models were trained: one using lesion-centric patches (64×64×64; 𝑥, 𝑦, 
𝑧) and the other using chest-region patches (512×512×8; 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧). Internal validation was conducted on 
DLND24, while external validation utilized LUNA16 and NLST datasets. The models’ performances were 
assessed using AUC-ROC, with subgroup analyses for demographic, clinical, and imaging factors. 
Statistical comparisons were performed using DeLong’s test. Gradient-based visualizations and probability 
distribution were further used for analysis. 
Results: The lesion-level model consistently outperformed the chest-region model across datasets. In 
internal validation, the lesion-level model achieved an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.61–0.81), compared to 0.68 
(95% CI: 0.57–0.77) for the chest-region model. External validation showed similar trends, with AUCs of 
0.90 (95% CI: 0.87–0.92) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79–0.82) on LUNA16 and NLST, respectively. Subgroup 
analyses revealed significant advantages for lesion-level models in certain histological subtypes 
(adenocarcinoma) and imaging conditions (CT manufacturers).  
Conclusion: Lesion-level models demonstrate superior classification performance, especially for external 
datasets and challenging subgroups, suggesting their clinical utility for precision lung cancer diagnostics. 
 
Introduction 
 
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with early detection being 
paramount to improving survival rates [1-4]. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is a standard 
modality for lung cancer screening, offering high sensitivity for detecting pulmonary nodules [4]. However, 
the radiological interpretation of CT scans is time-intensive and prone to variability[4]. Artificial 
intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to assist in lung cancer diagnosis by automating the 
detection and classification of nodules [5-9].  
 
While lesion-level AI models analyze specific nodule-centric regions, chest-region models encompass a 
broader anatomical context, potentially incorporating additional diagnostic information [7, 9, 10]. However, 
a comprehensive comparison of these approaches across diverse datasets and patient subgroups is lacking. 
This study aims to evaluate the performance of lesion-level and chest-region models for lung cancer 
classification using internal and external datasets, with subgroup analyses to explore variations by 
demographics, histology, and imaging parameters. Grad-CAM and related visualization techniques analyze 
feature attribution. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Patient Data and Imaging Datasets 
This study utilized three datasets: an internal dataset, Duke Lung Nodule Dataset 2024 (DLND24), and two 
external datasets, LUNA16 and NLST used in an earlier study [7, 11]. DLND24 consists of annotated chest 
CT scans from a single institution with lesion-level 3D bounding boxes. LUNA16 includes 888 CT scans 
annotated for pulmonary nodules, while NLST comprises low-dose CT scans from a large-scale cancer 
screening trial [7, 8, 12]. Table 1 shows the Demographic distribution of the data Cohort used for 
development (DLND24) and test (DLND24, LUAN16, NLST) sets. 
 
Study Design and Workflow 
Two AI models were developed and tested: one using lesion-level patches and another using chest-region 
inputs. Models were trained on DLND24 and validated on both internal and external datasets (LUNA16, 
NLST). Subgroup analyses assessed model performance by demographics, clinical factors, and imaging 
characteristics. 
 
Image Preprocessing 
For the lesion-level model, patches (64×64×64; 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) were extracted from CT scans, centered on nodules. 
For the chest-region model, 3D volumes (512×512×8; 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) spanning the entire lung region were used. 
All CT volumes were resampled to a resolution of 0.7 × 0.7 × 1.25 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧). Intensity values were clipped 
between -1000 and 500 and standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  
 
AI Model Development 
Two AI models were developed for lung cancer classification. The lesion-level model employed the 
ResNet50-SWS++, an architecture introduced in an earlier study, which utilized Strategic WarmStart++ 
(SWS++) pretraining [7]. This model was trained end-to-end using nodule-centric patches (64×64×64; 𝑥, 
𝑦, 𝑧) for malignancy classification. The chest-region model leveraged the pre-trained weights of a false 
positive reduction model, as detailed in prior work [7]. These weights served as initialization for the chest-
region lung cancer classification model, which analyzed chest-centric patches (512×512×8; 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧). 
Both models were optimized using binary cross-entropy loss and trained with the Adam optimizer. 
 
Grad-CAM and Feature Localization 
Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ were applied to generate heatmaps highlighting areas contributing to 
malignancy predictions [13]. Additional techniques, including SmoothGrad and Guided Backpropagation 
(GuidedBG), were used to validate and refine feature attribution [14]. Visualizations were qualitatively 
assessed to identify differences in feature localization between the two models. 
 
Probability Distribution 
Distributions were analyzed to evaluate model confidence and decision boundaries for in-distribution (ID) 
and external (out-of-distribution; OOD) cases. KDE plots were generated for probability. The degree of 
overlap between distributions served as an indicator of the model’s discriminative power and confidence in 
predictions. 
 
Evaluation Metrics 
Model performance was assessed using the Area under the curve-curve-receiver operating Characteristic 
(AUC-ROC) [15]. Subgroup analyses stratified results by gender, race, histology, smoking status, and CT 
manufacturer. Confidence intervals were derived using bootstrapping. DeLong’s test was used for statistical 
comparisons between models [15]. 
 
 
Results 
 
Overall Performance 
The lesion-level model consistently outperformed the chest-region model across all datasets. In internal 
validation using the DLND24 dataset, the lesion-level model achieved an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.61–
0.81), while the chest-region model achieved an AUC of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.57–0.77) (Fig.2a). External 
validation further highlighted the strength of the lesion-level model in Fig.2b and Fig.2c. On the LUNA16 
dataset, the lesion-level model demonstrated exceptional performance with an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87–
0.92), significantly surpassing the chest-region model, which had an AUC of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.58–0.67). 
Similarly, on the NLST dataset, the lesion-level model achieved an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79–0.82), 
compared to 0.71 (95% CI: 0.69–0.72) for the chest-region model. These results indicate that the lesion-
level approach is more effective at capturing malignancy-specific features. 
 
Subgroup Analysis 
The subgroup analyses revealed key insights into model performance across different patient demographics, 
histological subtypes, and imaging parameters shown in Fig.3. For demographic groups, the lesion-level 
model showed higher AUCs for both male and female patients compared to the chest-region model. Among 
smoking subgroups, the lesion-level model demonstrated significant advantages for current smokers, with 
an AUC improvement of approximately 10%. Histological analysis indicated that the lesion-level model 
performed exceptionally well for adenocarcinoma, with an AUC of 0.85, and squamous cell carcinoma, 
with an AUC of 0.81, compared to consistently lower performance by the chest-region model across all 
subtypes. Imaging parameter analysis on the LUNA16 dataset highlighted the robustness of lesion-level 
models across different CT manufacturers, including GE and Siemens, further validating their 
generalizability (Fig.4). 
 
Probability Distribution 
Probability distributions showed (Fig.5) sharper separations between benign and malignant cases for the 
lesion-level model compared to the chest-region model. The lesion-level model displayed well-separated 
peaks for labels 0 (no cancer) and 1 (cancer), indicating high confidence and discriminative power. In 
contrast, the chest-region model exhibited significant overlap between benign and malignant distributions, 
suggesting lower confidence and reduced ability to differentiate between classes effectively. 
 
Grad-CAM Visualization 
Grad-CAM analysis revealed distinct differences in feature localization between the two models (fig.6). 
The lesion-level model consistently focused on nodules, with heatmaps from Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ 
showing strong activations in nodule-specific regions. SmoothGrad and GuidedBG further validated these 
findings, demonstrating consistent and localized feature attribution. In contrast, the chest-region model 
displayed broader and less focused activations. Heatmaps from Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ showed 
diffuse activation patterns, often highlighting regions outside of nodules. This lack of specificity was 
corroborated by SmoothGrad and GuidedBG visualizations, which revealed inconsistent feature attribution. 
 
Discussion 
 
The results demonstrate the clear advantage of lesion-level models over chest-region models in lung cancer 
classification. The superior performance of lesion-level models in both internal and external validation 
suggests that focusing on nodule-specific features enables these models to better differentiate between 
benign and malignant lesions. The enhanced AUCs in external datasets, particularly LUNA16 and NLST, 
highlight the generalizability of the lesion-level approach. Additionally, subgroup analyses showed that 
lesion-level models consistently outperformed chest-region models across diverse demographics, 
histological subtypes, and imaging parameters, further underscoring their robustness. 
These findings are also consistent with the weakly-supervised classification studies associated with the 
classification of present or absent nodules [16-19]. 
 
The superior performance of lesion-level models has significant clinical implications. By leveraging 
nodule-specific information, these models align more closely with radiologists’ diagnostic workflows, 
where the primary focus is on evaluating nodule characteristics such as size, shape, and margins. The lesion-
level models' ability to generalize across datasets, including external validation cohorts, suggests they are 
well-suited for real-world applications. Furthermore, their higher sensitivity in certain subgroups indicates 
their potential to address variability in patient populations and disease presentations. Despite the promising 
results, several limitations warrant discussion. The datasets used in this study may introduce selection bias, 
as they include only annotated CT scans with labeled nodules, which may not represent the full spectrum 
of cases encountered in clinical practice. Additionally, while qualitative Grad-CAM and KDE analyses 
provide insights, quantitative metrics for interpretability and decision boundary robustness are needed. 
Building on these findings, future work will focus on integrating multimodal data, such as radiomics 
biomarkers and clinical history, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of malignancy risk. Exploring 
the inclusion of longitudinal imaging data could also enhance the ability to track disease progression and 
provide dynamic risk predictions. 
 
Lesion-level models demonstrate superior performance and feature localization compared to chest-region 
models for lung cancer classification. Visualizations highlight their focus on clinically relevant nodule 
features, reinforcing their suitability for nodule-specific diagnostics. These findings emphasize the 
importance of lesion-centric approaches in AI-driven lung cancer screening.

Figure 1. Overview of the study design and methodology for evaluating lesion-level and chest-region 
models for lung cancer classification. The analysis utilized three datasets: DLND24 (internal dataset, 
N=1613; n=2487 nodules), LUNA16 (external dataset, N=433; n=677 nodules), and NLST (external 
dataset, N=969; n=3128 nodules). Both models were trained on DLND24 and evaluated on internal and 
external test sets. The chest-region model analyzed large chest patches (512×512×8 voxels), while the 
lesion-level model focused on nodule-centric patches (64×64×64 voxels). The models were assessed for 
classification performance using AUC-ROC curves and subgroup analyses based on demographic and 
clinical factors. The workflow highlights the comparative evaluation of both models for internal, external, 
and subgroup-based performance assessments, emphasizing interpretability and clinical relevance.

row illustrates performance differences based on gender (female, male), race (Black/AA, White), 
ethnicity (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic), and smoking status (current smoker, former smoker). The middle 
row stratifies results by pack-years (21–30 years, 30+ years), screening group (screen-detected, other), 
and study year (year 0, year 1, year 2). The bottom row focuses on histological subtypes. Lesion-level 
models consistently outperform chest-region models across most subgroups, particularly in challenging 
histological cases such as adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma, underscoring their robustness and 
clinical utility.

model demonstrates consistently higher performance than the chest-region model across both size 
categories, with a significant advantage observed for large nodules (≥6 mm). These findings highlight 
the lesion-level model's superior ability to capture malignancy-relevant features across varying nodule 
sizes within the LUNA16 dataset.

probability distributions for cancer and no cancer predictions across both datasets, indicating high 
discriminative power and confidence in classification. In contrast, the chest-region model shows 
overlapping probability distributions, reflecting reduced confidence and a diminished ability to 
differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous cases. These findings highlight the lesion-level 
model's robustness and reliability in producing accurate predictions.
