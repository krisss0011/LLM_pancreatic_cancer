Abstract 
Can we understand and predict the evolutionary pathways by which bacteria acquire 
multi-drug resistance (MDR)? These questions have substantial potential impact in 
basic biology and in applied approaches to address the global health challenge of 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here, we review how a class of machine learning 
approaches called evolutionary accumulation modelling (EvAM) may help reveal these 
dynamics using genetic and/or phenotypic AMR datasets, without requiring longitudinal 
sampling. These approaches are well-established in cancer progression and 
evolutionary biology, but currently less used in AMR research. We discuss how EvAM 
can learn the evolutionary pathways by which drug resistances and AMR features are 
acquired as pathogens evolve, predict next evolutionary steps, identify inﬂuences 
between AMR features, and explore diWerences in MDR evolution between regions, 
demographics, and more. We demonstrate a case study on MDR evolution in 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these 
approaches, providing links to some approaches for implementation.  
 
Introduction 
Anti-microbial resistance (AMR) occurs when pathogens (like bacteria) evolve 
resistance to the drugs we use to kill them. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) occurs when a 
pathogen evolves resistance to multiple groups of drugs (usually three or more clinically 
relevant drug types). AMR is a growing health issue across the globe, particularly in 
developing countries: in 2019 and 2021, 1.27m and 1.14m deaths respectively were 
attributable to bacterial AMR, with the highest rates in sub-Saharan Africa (Murray et al., 
2022; Naghavi et al., 2024). AMR results in large excess societal costs due to prolonged 
illness and hospitalizations, need for isolation and use of expensive reserve medicines, 
and patients’ loss of productivity (Dadgostar, 2019; Morel et al., 2020; R. R. Roberts et 
al., 2009). AMR is one of the World Health Organization’s top 10 threats to human health 
(World Health Organisation, 2021). 
 
Given the importance of AMR for global health (Aslam et al., 2021; Djordjevic et al., 
2024), many research programmes are investigating diWerent aspects of the 
phenomenon (T. R. Walsh et al., 2023). These include basic science questions: from 
molecular mechanisms by which pathogens resist drug treatments (Darby et al., 2023; 
Ray et al., 2017; Reygaert, 2018; Sullivan et al., 2020) and surveillance of pathogens 
(Baker et al., 2023; Djordjevic et al., 2024), through the dynamics by which these 
mechanisms evolve in pathogen populations (Baquero et al., 2021; Maeda et al., 2020; 
Nichol et al., 2015). Clinically-motivated questions include the development of new 
treatments (Piddock, 2012; Terreni et al., 2021; C. Walsh, 2003), strategies for 
prevention ranging from infection prevention to antibiotic stewardship (Septimus, 2018; 
Spellberg et al., 2016), improved diagnostics, vaccination (Laxminarayan et al., 2024), 
as well as population education and citizen science (A. P. Roberts, 2020). Broader areas 
of investigation include the interplay with animal populations and the environment in a 
One Health Perspective (Hetland et al., 2024; Morel et al., 2020), and the public 
perception of AMR as a threat (Duncan et al., 2020; Fimreite et al., 2024). This range of 
research activity has emphasized the power of interdisciplinary approaches in 
combatting AMR, and of quantitative approaches to extract insights from large-scale 
data (Djordjevic et al., 2024; Holt et al., 2015; Munk et al., 2022). 
 
Here, we focus on one particular aspect of AMR – the dynamics by which multidrug 
resistance evolves in pathogens – and a particular emerging interdisciplinary approach 
to understand and predict these dynamics. This approach is called “evolutionary 
accumulation modelling” or EvAM (Diaz-Uriarte & Herrera-Nieto, 2022; Diaz-Uriarte & 
Johnston, 2024; Schill et al., 2024).  
 
The core task of EvAM is to use data to learn the pathways by which an evolving system 
accumulates features over time. These features (usually called “characters” in 
evolutionary biology) are typically binary representations of particular properties or 
values of interest in the system. We have, for now, deliberately left these descriptions 
broad, because EvAM has been applied across a very broad range of contexts in biology 
and beyond (Diaz-Uriarte & Johnston, 2024). Examples include the accumulation of 
mutations in developing tumours (Angaroni et al., 2022; Beerenwinkel et al., 2015; 
Gerstung et al., 2009; Hjelm et al., 2006; Luo et al., 2023; Montazeri et al., 2016; Nicol et 
al., 2021; Ross & Markowetz, 2016; Schill et al., 2020); the accumulation of gene losses 
in evolving organelles across species (Johnston & Williams, 2016); the accumulation of 
symptoms in disease progression across patients (Johnston et al., 2019); the 
accumulation of completed tasks in online courses across students (Peach et al., 
2021); and indeed the evolution of drug resistance in pathogens (Aga et al., 2024; 
Beerenwinkel, Däumer, et al., 2005; Greenbury et al., 2020; Moen & Johnston, 2023; 
Montazeri et al., 2015; Posada-Céspedes et al., 2021). The dynamics of any evolving 
system where a given observation can be represented by a collection of 
presence/absence markers can be analysed using EvAM. The mathematical structure of 
the “space” of such binary marker strings, and evolutionary steps between them, is a 
hypercube – the analogy of the familiar 3D cube in any number of dimensions – leading 
to several approaches being classed under “hypercubic inference”.  
 
Given observations of such a system, diWerent EvAM approaches perform machine 
learning to estimate diWerent interesting properties of the underlying accumulation 
process. For example, does acquiring feature A make it more or less likely that feature B 
will be acquired? If a given instance has features A, B, and C, what is the next most likely 
feature to be acquired? Are there combinations of features that correlate with future 
behaviour – like death or survival of a patient with those symptoms? And are these 
answers universal, or do they diWer across patients, hospitals, regions, or countries? 
Importantly, longitudinal data is not required by EvAM to learn dynamic behaviour – 
information on the orderings of, and inﬂuences between, features can be inferred from 
cross-sectional observations. 
 
Evolution accumulation modelling for MDR evolution 
How can EvAM be useful in the study of MDR? First consider, for example, the case 
where our features are resistances to each of a set of drugs, and our observations are a 
collection of pathogen isolates. Then each of the questions above becomes potentially 
valuable both for basic biology and for clinical strategy. If resistance to drug A makes an 
isolate more likely to evolve resistance to drug B, maybe we should avoid that 
combination. But if drug A decreases the probability of drug B resistance evolving, the 
combination therapy may be more eWective. If a new isolate is observed in the clinic 
that is resistant to drugs A, B, and C, then predicting the next resistance “step” suggests 
a treatment that should be avoided. If particular combinations of drug resistances 
correlate with, for example, virulence, a triaging strategy can be designed. And if 
diWerences in the evolutionary dynamics of MDR (for example, between countries, or 
patient demographics) can be identiﬁed and characterized with data, interventions that 
are more targeted to a particular circumstance may be designed and tested. 
 
As a more concrete example, several EvAM approaches have been used by our group to 
study the evolution of MDR in a Russian Mycobacterium tuberculosis dataset (Casali et 
al., 2014) that has become a benchmark for the approaches that we develop. Outlined 
in the next section, this example case study involves features describing resistance or 
susceptibility to each of 10 drugs across a dataset involving 1000 sequenced isolates. 
The diWerent ordering of drug resistance acquisitions, inﬂuences between them, 
predicted future behaviours, and similarities and diWerences between countries, have 
been learned using diWerent EvAM approaches (Fig. 1; (Aga et al., 2024; García Pascual 
et al., 2024; Greenbury et al., 2020; Moen & Johnston, 2023)). 
 
The features under study in EvAM need not only be phenotypic. Genetic features can 
readily be studied too, addressing research questions accordingly. AMR typically 
evolves through mutations and horizontal gene transfer events. While a particular AMR 
phenotype can be the result of a number of diWerent genetic events, mapping the actual 
genetic feature strengthens the model by providing a more direct evidence of the 
ongoing evolution. For example, SNPs or other small-scale genetic changes linked to 
resistance can be considered, given targeted or whole-genome sequencing data. Does 
the acquisition of one AMR-linked mutation inﬂuence the acquisition rate of others?  
 
On another scale – and features at diWerent scales can readily be combined in EvAM – 
the presence or absence of whole genes conferring resistance can be considered. Does 
the presence of a particular gene, for example, inﬂuence the propensity of a strain to 
acquire other AMR-linked changes? Indeed, other instances of EvAM used to model 
AMR include estimation of evolutionary pathways to drug resistance in HIV 
(Beerenwinkel, Däumer, et al., 2005; Posada-Céspedes et al., 2021). Other AMR work 
with an implicit or explicit EvAM picture has included “bottom-up” pictures coupling an 
EvAM-like hypercubic evolutionary space with ﬁtness landscape values in Escherichia 
coli (Das et al., 2020; Das & Krug, 2022; Nichol et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2011), that also 
address beta-lactamase mutants (Farr et al., 2023). These empirically-linked 
landscapes often consider a limited number of features (by necessity, as the space of 
genotypes expands exponentially with the number of features considered). By contrast, 
the EVaM approaches we will consider take a “top-down” perspective, less directly 
coupled to ﬁtness and more concerned with the occurrence of, and transitions 
between, diWerent states across observation sets. 
 
An EvAM MDR example: multidrug resistance in tuberculosis 
To illustrate an EvAM application to MDR, consider the tuberculosis dataset mentioned 
above. Here, resistance proﬁles describe the presence or absence of resistance to ten 
diWerent drugs (Fig. 1A). 395 of 1000 isolates have complete proﬁles; others are missing 
at least one drug entry. A phylogeny, constructed in the original study using independent 
genetic information from the isolates, is also available (Fig. 1A). 
 
To use EvAM here, each isolate with a complete proﬁle is assigned a length-10 binary 
string, with a 0 in a given position meaning “susceptible to this drug” and a 1 meaning 
“resistant to this drug”. In this illustrative example, we assume that resistances are 
acquired irreversibly. We then reconstruct ancestral states with a maximum parsimony 
picture. For irreversible dynamics, this means an ancestor is assumed to have been 
resistant (1) if both descendants are resistant, or susceptible (0) if neither or only one 
descendant is resistant. The collection of ancestor-descendant transitions throughout 
the phylogeny is used as the input data for EvAM. 
 
We can then use EvAM approaches to infer the evolutionary pathways of MDR across 
these observations. First, we consider the “transition network” learned from the data 
using HyperTraPS-CT (Aga et al., 2024). This network describes the likely evolutionary 
steps that an isolate with a particular drug resistance will next take (Fig. 1B). The 
network structure shows clear canalization – a limited number of pathways are 
supported, with some variability (branching in the network). For example, isoniazid 
(INH) and streptomycin (STR) resistances are typically the ﬁrst to be acquired, often 
followed by rifampicin (RIF), then ethambutol (ETH), prothionamide (PRO), and 
pyrazinamide (PZA), although the particular orderings of resistances are ﬂexible with 
this general theme. WHO guidelines suggest INH and RIF treatment, supplemented with 
PZA and with ETH in regions of high INH resistance (World Health Organization, 2022) – 
so these orderings may in part reﬂect a response to treatment regimens, while in part 
suggesting dynamics (like PRO resistance) that cannot immediately be predicted from 
such protocols (see Discussion).  
Figure 1. Example insights from EvAM for MDR evolution. These results are from HyperTraPS-CT 
and HyperHMM applied to MDR evolution in tuberculosis (Aga et al., 2024; Casali et al., 2014; García 
Pascual et al., 2024; Moen & Johnston, 2023; Olson et al., 2023)). (A) Dataset, comprising a set of 
phylogenetically-linked isolates with drug resistance proﬁles (grey, resistant; white, susceptible) to 
each of ten drugs (codes in text). (B) Inferred hypercubic transition network describing likely 
pathways of MDR evolution from an initial, fully susceptible state (top) to a fully resistant state 
(bottom). Each step down the network corresponds to the acquisition of resistance to another drug; 
line width gives probability of that step. Central graphic with dotted lines illustrates a prediction: 
from a state with INH, RIF, STR resistance, the predicted most likely next step is EMB resistance. (C) 
Testing predictions: when a prediction is made about the next likely step (as in (B)), is that step 
actually the next that occurs in reality? Horizontal axis gives the predicted ordering of the step that 
was, in reality, the next step. (D) Interactions between features. Inferred positive and negative 
inﬂuences: does resistance to drug A increase (blue), or decrease (red), the probability of acquiring 
resistance to drug B? (E) Comparison of inferred dynamics across countries. Multidimensional 
scaling plot of inferred transition networks for di]erent countries (clusters 1 and 2 are sets of 
countries with identical observations), illustrating the structure of between-country similarities and 
di]erences in dynamics (García Pascual et al., 2024). Insets give some example networks, styled as 
in (B). Drug codes: INH (isoniazid); RIF (rifampicin, rifampin in the United States); PZA 
(pyrazinamide); EMB (ethambutol); STR (streptomycin); AMI (amikacin); CAP (capreomycin); MOX 
(moxiﬂoxacin); OFL (oﬂoxacin); and PRO (prothionamide). 
 
 
 
The transition network provides direct predictions about the future behaviour of a given 
strain. For example, given an isolate currently resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, and 
streptomycin, what drug resistance will most likely be acquired next? As Fig. 1B shows, 
the trained model suggests that ethambutol resistance is the most likely next step  
(probability 29.2%), although others are possible. The performance of these predictions 
can be tested with a training-test split. Here, a subset of the data is used to train the 
model, and an unused subset is used to test predictions. By far the most common 
outcome is that the true next step in the test data was the one predicted by the trained 
model (Fig. 1C). 
 
Next, we can explore interactions between features – whether one drug resistance 
makes it more or less likely to evolve another. Fig. 1D shows the inﬂuences inferred from 
the data. Several positive inﬂuences are detected – for example, RIF resistance 
increases the probability of acquiring oﬂoxacin (OFL) resistance, which in turn strongly 
increases the probability of moxiﬂoxacin resistance (MOX). OFL and MOX are both 
ﬂuoroquinolones, suggesting a biochemical rationale for this latter inﬂuence. Perhaps 
more interestingly, a negative interaction is also detected: PRO resistance makes RIF 
resistance less likely, suggesting rifampicin as a choice for strains that are 
prothionamide-resistant. 
 
We can also use EvAM to learn evolutionary dynamics using data sourced from diWerent 
cases – for example, from diWerent countries. In Fig. 1E we used HyperHMM (Moen & 
Johnston, 2023) to infer transition networks using data on tuberculosis resistance from 
the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Centre (BV-BRC) (Davis et al., 2016; 
Olson et al., 2023) for diWerent countries around the world (García Pascual et al., 2024). 
Here (methods taken from (García Pascual et al., 2024)) we retained records for the 
nine drugs (oﬂoxacin, ethambutol, isoniazid, streptomycin, capreomycin, rifampin, 
kanamycin, amikacin, pyrazinamide) for which > 100k observed isolates were available, 
subsetted by country of origin. We discarded records with any missing data for these 
drugs, leaving a total of 117207 isolates. In this illustrative case, we retain only unique 
drug resistance patterns within each country, to guard against pseudoreplication (see 
Discussion), retaining between 1 and 93 unique patterns for each of 53 countries. 
Following inference with HyperHMM, the diWerent transition networks are compared 
using the “l1 norm” – a summed absolute diWerence between transition probabilities. 
This is visualised using multidimensional scaling in Fig. 1E, so that more similar 
transition networks generally appear closer than more diWerent ones. The diWerent 
sources of variability – diWerent ﬁrst-step drug resistances, diWerent subsequent 
canalized pathways, and diWerent amounts of variability in the dynamics – can then be 
interrogated across country sets, as described further in (García Pascual et al., 2024). 
 
This case study demonstrates several outputs of EvAM approaches, and also some 
questions which can arise. For example, are these inferred dynamics an intrinsic 
property of the bacterium itself, a response to the speciﬁc dosing regimen used in 
Russia, or a combination? To what extent can this trained model be used to predict 
pathogen evolution in other pathogens, other countries, or other settings? How could 
horizontal transfer of resistance traits (for instance, transfer of genes via plasmids) be 
accommodated? In the discussion we address these and other points in the 
interpretation of EVaM approaches. 
 
What is EvAM not? 
Substantial exciting quantitative research is currently using large-scale data to explore 
AMR evolution and behaviour (Holt et al., 2015; Munk et al., 2022; Wyres et al., 2020). 
Having attempted to describe what EvAM is, and some ways that it may be useful in 
MDR evolution contexts, it will be important for us to describe what EvAM is not. 
 
EvAM is not (directly) a clustering or dimensionality reduction method. A common 
early step in large-scale data analysis – including genomic AMR data -- is to use 
clustering and/or projection methods to reduce dimensionality (including principal 
components analysis (PCA); see, for example, (Munk et al., 2022)). EvAM does not 
directly do this, although it would be possible to using clustering methods to construct 
eWective features for EvAM analysis (see Discussion). Rather, EvAM considers a given 
set of features, and how they evolve over time. 
 
EvAM is not (directly) a classiﬁcation tool for assigning categories to genomic (or other 
data). In AMR, many methods exist for – for example – inferring phenotypic drug 
resistances or other proﬁles from genotypes: some examples are (Davis et al., 2016; 
Hyun et al., 2020; Kavvas et al., 2020) and several are compared in (Ren et al., 2022). 
EvAM does not do this, instead working with features that it is provided as input (which 
can include such inferred proﬁles). However, EvAM can be used to assign likely 
evolutionary trajectories to given samples, which has been used in illustrative 
computation of triage high versus low-risk disease states (Johnston et al., 2019). 
 
EvAM is not (exclusively) an approach for estimating phylogenetic relationships 
between isolates or observations. Some EvAM approaches either use the observations 
themselves, or independent information, to estimate a phylogeny as an intermediate 
step (Aga et al., 2024; Greenbury et al., 2020; Johnston & Williams, 2016; Luo et al., 
2023). But the goal of EvAM is usually to learn how features evolve over a (given or 
estimated) phylogeny. In this sense, it resembles the so-called Mk model in 
phylogenetic comparative methods (Johnston & Diaz-Uriarte, 2024). The resemblance 
has some nuances, discussed in “Implementation” below. But EvAM typically assumes 
either independent, cross-sectional observations (likely not appropriate in AMR 
settings) or requires an estimated phylogeny and an approach for ancestral state 
reconstruction to be provided. If no phylogeny is available, progress can still be made by 
placing bounds on the possible dynamics (see Discussion). 
 
EvAM is not a microscopic quantitative model of how changes arise and accumulate. 
Connecting the outputs of EvAM even to a model of ﬁtness is non-trivial (Baquero et al., 
2021; Diaz-Colunga & Diaz-Uriarte, 2021; Diaz-Uriarte, 2018; Diaz-Uriarte & Johnston, 
2024; Diaz-Uriarte & Vasallo, 2019; Misra et al., 2014). Several exciting studies have 
successfully coupled a hypercubic EvAM space to direct ﬁtness values, leading to 
experimental and theoretical insight (Nichol et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2011). However, 
more detailed insights about molecular mechanisms do not immediately arise from 
EvAM output. Given case-speciﬁc information, the outputs of EvAM can readily be used 
in hypothesis testing about generative mechanisms (Johnston & Røyrvik, 2020; Johnston 
& Williams, 2016; Williams et al., 2013). 
 
Implementations and source data 
Most EvAM methods developed in the last decade have free open-source software 
distributions available on repositories like Github. The meta-platform EvAM-Tools1 
(Diaz-Uriarte & Herrera-Nieto, 2022) brings a collection of these together with an easy-
to-use interface. Many are implemented in R (R Core Team, 2022), requiring some 
familiarity with how to load libraries and data in an R environment. In most cases, a 
matrix or dataframe of binary-string observations can be directly passed to a function in 
the codebase.  
 
However, the particular evolutionary setting of most MDR problems makes several 
established approaches less applicable. Many EvAM approaches traditionally assumed 
that observations are independent, cross-sectional instances of the process under 
study, which involves irreversible acquisition of features over time. This picture 
originates from the historical focus on cancer progression – where observations were 
typically tumour proﬁles from independent patient samples. But treating 
phylogenetically-linked observations as independent leads to the problem of 
pseudoreplication (Boyko & Beaulieu, 2023; Maddison & FitzJohn, 2015; Revell, 2010; 
Rohle, 2006; Schraiber et al., 2024; Uyeda et al., 2018). Here, because features may be 
inherited from an ancestor rather than independently acquired, an independent picture 
may give undue statistical weight to observations that actually reﬂect commonality by 
descent.  
 
The true phylogeny connecting observations in an evolving tumour is usually 
unavailable. This makes the workﬂow in cancer studies slightly diWerent from that in 
evolutionary biology (including the evolution of AMR) where an independently 
constructed phylogeny is often available. Several EvAM methods from the cancer 
literature use cross-sectional data to estimate the ordering of feature acquisitions that 
give rise to an observed set of observations, recently including Mutation Order2 (Gao et 
al., 2022), SPhyR3 (El-Kebir, 2018), SCITE4 (Jahn et al., 2016), SiFit5 (Zafar et al., 2017), 
with approaches generalising these pictures including REVOLVER6 (Caravagna et al., 
2018) and HINTRA7 (Khakabimamaghani et al., 2019). Many methods above make the 
“inﬁnite sites” assumption – eWectively, that a given change can only ever occur once -- 
which then allows us to reconstruct both the phylogeny and the ancestor states in a so-
called “perfect phylogeny”. However, this picture neglects the possibility that the same 
feature may arise several times independently (parallel evolution), and so may not be

best suited to an AMR perspective. SCARLET8 (Satas et al., 2020) allows loss of features 
as well as acquisitions, substantially generalizing the supported dynamics. Other 
cancer approaches more generally attempt to infer dependencies between features 
from cross-sectional data, so that, for example, feature A is required for the acquisition 
of feature B. Parallel approaches generalize this to a stochastic picture, where feature A 
inﬂuences the (random) acquisition of feature B, including mutual hazard networks 
(MHN)9 (Schill et al., 2020).  
 
One set of EvAM approaches – under the umbrella of “hypercubic inference” – were 
designed to deal with phylogenetically-embedded data, including from MDR. These 
include HyperTraPS (Greenbury et al., 2020; Johnston & Williams, 2016), HyperHMM10 
(Moen & Johnston, 2023), and HyperTraPS-CT11 (Aga et al., 2024). These approaches 
take transitions – from an ancestral to a descendent state -- as fundamental 
observations. Such transitions can be read oW from a phylogeny when combined with a 
preliminary step of ancestral state reconstruction, for example by assuming rare 
irreversible transitions as with the tuberculosis case above. Other approaches including 
TreeMHN12 (Luo et al., 2023) have been developed to analyse “phylogenetic” data from 
longitudinal studies within tumours, and may be coerced to handle phylogenetic data in 
an AMR context. Recently, the Mk model from phylogenetic comparative methods has 
been used in an EvAM setting, simultaneously performing ancestral state 
reconstruction and inference of feature dynamics (HyperMk13, (Johnston & Diaz-Uriarte, 
2024)). This approach also – rarely among EvAM methods -- supports reversible 
dynamics, potentially making it easier to capture MDR feature that are acquired 
reversibly (for example, through the acquisition of plasmids or other transferable 
genetic elements which can then be lost). However, it is computationally expensive and 
limited to a small number of features compared to other approaches.  
 
To summarise: not all EvAM approaches from the cancer literature support the 
combination of phylogenetically-linked data, stochastic positive and negative 
dependencies, non-additive inﬂuences of sets of features, and reversibility that may be 
appropriate in AMR cases. TreeMHN supports the ﬁrst two and HyperTraPS(-CT) and 
HyperHMM support the ﬁrst three points (if ancestral state reconstruction can be 
performed). HyperMk is, to our knowledge, the only approach that supports all these 
points (including reversibility), but at the moment is limited in the number of features it 
supports.  
 
To demonstrate the implementation of EvAM from source data, we have created a 
Github repository at https://github.com/StochasticBiology/EvAM-MDR with the code 
necessary to download, preprocess, and analyse the data from the tuberculosis case 
study above using HyperTraPS-CT. Once libraries, dataset, and tree are imported (Fig. 
1A), training the model is accomplished in two lines of R code, and producing each plot

Discussion and future directions 
As with any approach, diWerent EvAM methods have strengths and weaknesses; some 
have been outlined above. There is a substantial collection of research directions that 
have potential to expand and improve the use of these approaches in AMR evolution. 
Three topics that, in our experience, are the most common questions from an applied 
perspective involve reversibility (particularly pertinent when horizontal gene transfer is 
an important mechanism for AMR evolution), selective pressures, and continuous 
values. We will discuss these in turn. 
 
As we have mentioned, many existing EvAM approaches assume that features are 
acquired irreversibly. In some cases this is not necessarily an unreasonable picture. 
Many of the AMR-conferring mutations in the tuberculosis case above, for example, are 
chromosomal changes, which may have a reasonably long persistence time in strains 
(Casali et al., 2014). However, in other cases, reversibility is likely an important aspect 
of the evolutionary dynamics. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, for example, many AMR genes 
are acquired via plasmids or other horizontally transferred genetic elements, which can 
readily be lost (especially if selective pressures due to drugs are removed) (Holt et al., 
2015). Traditional EvAM approaches, dealing with irreversible accumulation, cannot 
capture such loss dynamics. One reason is that reversibility means that, in principle, an 
inﬁnite set of evolutionary pathways can exist. For example, if we see a pathogen with 
resistance to drugs A and B, an irreversible picture would propose “gain A, gain B” and 
“gain B, gain A” as the two possible pathways. A reversible picture would allow any 
number of losses of either resistance following a gain, challenging the learning process. 
The recent work mentioned above, using the Mk model in an EvAM setting, can address 
this, but further work is needed to overcome its currently limited scale (Johnston & Diaz-
Uriarte, 2024). 
 
The next question, selective pressure, has several subquestions. First, as posed in the 
tuberculosis case study above – how can we unpack intrinsic, “universal” evolutionary 
behaviour from the response to the particular set of selective pressures found in a given 
dataset (for example, the particular drug use regimen in a given country)? Second, can 
the evolutionary dynamics inferred from a given dataset be interpreted as a ﬁtness 
landscape or other quantitative picture directly linked to population behaviour?  
 
The ﬁrst subquestion may be addressed using observations taken from diWerent cases 
where the selective pressures facing pathogens are diWerent. For example, diWerent 
countries may employ diWerent drug regimens against a given pathogen. Comparing 
inferred evolutionary dynamics across such instances will reveal the similarities 
(corresponding more to intrinsic behaviour) and diWerences (corresponding more to 
case-speciﬁc responses), which can be quantiﬁed with summary statistics. If the 
inferred ordering of resistance acquisitions in each country always exactly follows the 
dosing regimen in that country, MDR dynamics are likely purely determined by dosing 
exposure. But if (as in the tuberculosis case above), there are observed departures from 
strict agreement with dosing regimen, other factors – possibly intrinsic to the 
pathogen’s biology, or other environmental eWects – likely also shape evolution. This is 
particularly likely if resistance machinery comes with a high cost in the absence of 
drugs. Many EvAM approaches explore between-case variability by inferring diWerent 
models from diWerent subsets of the data (Angaroni et al., 2022; Caravagna et al., 2018; 
Johnston et al., 2019; Johnston & Røyrvik, 2020; Nicol et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2013); 
we have developed some early approaches to compare EvAM outputs across diWerent 
observation sets, including simple PCA (Williams et al., 2013), probabilistic summaries 
(Dauda et al., 2024), and the more detailed WFCC approach borrowing from topological 
data analysis (Fig. 1E; (García Pascual et al., 2024)). EvAM approaches learning 
deterministic tree-based dynamics have employed mixtures of trees to account for 
subject heterogeneity, including in drug-resistance studies of HIV (Beerenwinkel et al., 
2004; Beerenwinkel, Rahnenführer, et al., 2005; Bogojeska, Alexa, et al., 2008; 
Bogojeska, Lengauer, et al., 2008), though to our knowledge these approaches have not 
been applied to phylogenetically-linked data or models involving stochastic 
dependencies. Ongoing research is considering gene-gene-environment (GxGxE) 
interactions in AMR and their inﬂuence on predictability (Das et al., 2020). In future, 
other approaches perhaps including inspiration from mixed Markov models (Fridman, 
2003) may prove valuable in quantifying such between-case comparisons. 
 
The second question – a connection to ﬁtness landscapes – is an ongoing area of 
research in EvAM (Diaz-Uriarte & Johnston, 2024). In an AMR context, hypercubic 
pictures of drug resistance spaces and associated ﬁtness landscapes have been used 
to guide experimental treatment strategies (Nichol et al., 2015) and explore evolutionary 
trajectories (Tan et al., 2011). It is not in general straightforward to link inferred 
evolutionary dynamics to a speciﬁc ﬁtness landscape; noise, epistasis, and other 
issues complicate the task (Baquero et al., 2021; Diaz-Colunga & Diaz-Uriarte, 2021; 
Diaz-Uriarte, 2018; Diaz-Uriarte & Johnston, 2024; Diaz-Uriarte & Vasallo, 2019; Misra et 
al., 2014). AMR-speciﬁc theory for learning and exploiting information about ﬁtness 
landscapes is a current area of research (Baquero et al., 2021), and linking this picture 
to EvAM outputs is an exciting avenue of future research to make these connections 
more general and quantitative. 
 
The inclusion of continuous values in EvAM is pertinent for AMR applications because 
many quantities of interest are not simple presence/absence factors. Resistance 
phenotypes, for example, are often fundamentally reported as (continuous) minimum 
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for a drug – with a threshold then applied to convert 
this to a susceptible/resistant factor. Previous EvAM work has had some success 
binarizing variables using a collection of inequalities (for example, is x < 0, x < 1, x < 2 
and so on), eWectively imposing diWerent thresholds (Johnston et al., 2019). Recent 
developments in phylogenetic comparative methods (though currently limited to one 
continuous and one discrete feature) may allow a more satisfactory inclusion of 
continuous data (Boyko et al., 2023) but have yet to be applied to AMR. 
 
Other directions for future research involve the properties of the source data (Diaz-
Uriarte & Johnston, 2024; Schill et al., 2024). For resistance phenotypes, evolution 
between binary states of susceptible/resistance markers is reasonably intuitive. But for 
genetic features, there may be a large collection of variants that have similar 
consequences but are unlikely to ever all be accumulated in a given strain. Genomic 
AMR datasets often exhibit pronounced sparsity, with large numbers of relevant 
features but only a small number ever acquired by a given strain (Holt et al., 2015). Can 
such sparse datasets be transformed – for example, by clustering similar genes or other 
resistance features (Dauda et al., 2024) – so that inference using the transformed data 
is more informative? 
 
Uncertainty in the source data – whether a feature is really present or absent in a 
sample – is also a pertinent feature in AMR studies. Observations of AMR features 
(phenotypic or genotypic) may be incomplete, due to (for example) only limited panels 
of drugs used in phenotyping, or incomplete sequencing. Uncertainty can also be 
involved in the classiﬁcation of features which are measured, particularly as the 
functions of, and relationships between, “resistance genes” (and other 
upstream/downstream genes) remain incompletely understood. In addition to the 
uncertainty, the acquired resistance we are trying to model might aWect the 
observability of the diWerent events or combinations of events we are trying to model, 
leading to possible collider bias – an issue addressed in (Schill et al., 2024). Several 
EvAM approaches allow for incomplete or uncertain cross-sectional observations 
(Gerstung et al., 2009; Montazeri et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2013), but uncertainty in 
EvAM approaches with phylogenetically-embedded data – where ancestral states are 
also uncertain – is less well developed (Aga et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2022; Greenbury et 
al., 2020) and an important target for future research. 
 
What if no phylogeny is available to connect the observations? One approach is to take 
two limits. First, incorrectly assume that observations are independent, and perform 
inference in this setting (subject to pseudoreplications). Second, estimate a phylogeny 
using a maximum parsimony assumption with the data itself as an alternative. Then, the 
maximum and minimum possible amounts of parallel evolution are captured by the two 
approaches, and the “true” picture will fall somewhere between the two. Then the 
outputs of the two alternatives pictures can be viewed as “bounds” on the likely 
underlying dynamics (Dauda et al., 2024). 
 
Conclusions 
We have tried to summarise some of the ways that evolutionary accumulation 
modelling may contribute useful insights in the study of AMR. EvAM approaches are a 
diWerent kind of tool to the approaches used to cluster, link, and analyse genomic and 
metagenomic sequence data – they consider how discrete, AMR-related features evolve 
across the phylogeny that connects a collection of isolates. They have substantial 
power to learn the evolutionary pathways by which these features emerge, and to 
further analyse interactions between features and predict future behaviours. We hope 
that some of these aspects of EvAM may be of interest and potential use for both basic 
and clinical AMR researchers, and hope to convince this community that EvAM 
approaches can form a valuable part in data-driven research on AMR evolution.
