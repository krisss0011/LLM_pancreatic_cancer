• Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of mortality. Many 
treatments for NSCLC rely on combination therapy with bevacizumab, an anti-
VEGF adjunct. 
• Evidence is presented that scheduling bevacizumab several hours before 
combination antiproliferatives improves treatment efficacy, via a mathematical 
model built using patient data collated from 11 clinical trials in NSCLC. 
• This work indicates that future trials in NSCLC with bevacizumab should test 
staggered sequential scheduling. Furthermore, a model fit on a large human 
clinical trial dataset is provided for future modeling and simulation work in 
NSCLC.

ABSTRACT 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is often intrinsically resistant to several first- 
and second-line therapeutics and can rapidly acquire further resistance after a patient 
begins receiving treatment. Treatment outcomes are therefore significantly impacted by 
the optimization of therapeutic scheduling. Previous preclinical research has suggested 
scheduling bevacizumab in sequence with combination antiproliferatives could 
significantly improve clinical outcomes. Mathematical modeling is a well-suited tool for 
investigating this proposed scheduling modification. To address this critical need, 
individual patient tumor data from 11 clinical trials in NSCLC has been collated and 
used to develop a semi-mechanistic model of NSCLC growth and response to the 
various therapeutics represented in those trials. Precise estimates of clinical parameters 
fundamental to cancer modeling have been produced—such as the rate of acquired 
resistance to various pharmaceuticals, the relationship between drug concentration and 
cancer cell death, as well as the fine temporal dynamics of vascular remodeling in 
response to bevacizumab. In a reserved portion of the dataset, this model was used to 
predict the efficacy of individual treatment time courses with a mean error rate of 59.7% 
after a single tumor measurement and 11.7% after three successive tumor 
measurements. A delay of 9.6 hours between pemetrexed-cisplatin and bevacizumab 
administration is predicted to optimize the benefit of sequential administration. At this 
gap, approximately 93.5% of simulated patients benefited from a gap in sequential 
administration compared with concomitant administration. Of those simulated patients, 
the mean improvement in tumor reduction was 20.7%. This result suggests that 
scheduling a modest gap between the administration of bevacizumab and its partner 
antiproliferatives could meaningfully improve patient outcomes in NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality nationwide, with an estimated 
125,070 deaths expected in the United States this year, 2024 (1). Approximately 85% of 
those deaths are attributable to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The need for 
pharmacological intervention is dependent on the disease stage at the time of diagnosis. 
If NSCLC is detected early, surgical resection followed by limited adjutant therapy is 
generally successful in achieving complete remission (2,3). Late-stage NSCLC metastases 
are often too diffusely spread for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective; therefore, the occurrence 
of a diagnosis at an advanced stage necessitates treatment strategies predominantly centered 
on pharmacological interventions. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with 
localized NSCLC is approximately 58%. However, most patients with NSCLC are first 
diagnosed at the late stage of the disease, with a five-year survival rate estimated at 6% 
in the presence of distant metastases (4,5). Ultimately, most patients with mid-to-late-
stage NSCLC will be prescribed a platinum-based combination chemotherapy and/or 
immunotherapy, e.g. bevacizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel, pembrolizumab-carboplatin-
pemetrexed (6–8). The most cutting-edge first-line combination therapies in NSCLC are 
atezolizumab-bevacizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel combination therapy (established in 
IMpower150 study)  (9) and pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum combination 
therapy (established in KEYNOTE-189) (10,11). Patients with advanced cases of NSCLC 
are often cycled through several antiproliferative regimens due to high rates of acquired 
and intrinsic multi-drug resistance (12–15).  
Acquired or intrinsic drug resistance is a major cause of first-line therapeutic failure 
in NSCLC. In a previous study of resected NSCLC by d’Amato et al., intermediate to 
extreme resistance to carboplatin was found in 68% of NSCLC cultures (vs. 63% and 
 
 
 
5 
40% for cisplatin and paclitaxel, respectively) (12). Likewise, in the recent KEYNOTE-001 
study, NSCLC patients receiving pembrolizumab had an objective response rate of 
19.4%, indicating that a vast majority of individuals did not significantly respond to therapy 
(15). Finally, in the most recent ARIES observational cohort study of first-line NSCLC 
treatment involving bevacizumab, the failure rate for 1967 patients was approximately 
51% (16). Taken together, there is a clear and critical unmet clinical need to improve 
patient response to treatment and clinical outcome in NSCLC. 
Improving clinical outcome in NSCLC with existing therapeutics requires 
addressing at least three prominent challenges: 1). The disease is often late stage at the 
time of diagnosis, and treatment relies heavily on complex combination therapies. 
However, oncologists currently have few evidence-based tools to individualize and 
optimize scheduling of those therapies; 2). The success rate of first-line therapy is 
typically low, therapeutic dosing (amount, interval, gap) strategies are often unoptimized, 
and resistance to treatment is rapidly acquired (6–8). 3). The window between the 
threshold for therapeutic efficacy and drug overdose can be narrow, especially with the 
relatively long elimination half-life of most antiproliferatives. Meeting these challenges are 
made even more difficult by the relatively sparse and sporadic collection of 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in clinical studies involving cancer. 
The status quo as it pertains to therapeutic management and dosing decisions in 
NSCLC is that medications are administered according to recommended guidelines, and 
those guidelines are in turn established through one-to-one human clinical trials. A major 
limitation in this approach is that it mainly focuses on the average patient, such that 
clinicians have little evidence-based guidance to help them individualize treatment in 
 
 
 
6 
patients who are unresponsive or achieve partial response to therapy.  
Nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) population modeling is a highly relevant 
computational framework for exploring optimization of drug dosing schedules on an 
individual level, without the considerable time and resource investment required to 
conduct a suite of one-to-one clinical trials. With enough data, NLME modeling has the 
potential to overcome some of the intrinsic limitations of antiproliferative optimization 
through simulation of alternative schedules and clinical trials. And though measurements 
in any given NSCLC patient may be sparse, if enough high-quality data can be pooled 
between studies a precise predictive model can be built from the richness of the variation 
between clinical trials. 
NLME models are designed to continuously incorporate new information, and can 
easily be expanded by incorporating new data to simulate relevant experimental designs 
and guide treatment decisions, such as: What happens if dosages are halved, but 
administrations are made twice as often? If some pre-existing condition requires 
scheduling modification (e.g., renal damage and cisplatin nephrotoxicity), how should 
dosages of concurrent chemotherapeutics be modified? What is the ideal time after first 
dose to start looking for signs of acquired resistance?  
There are several paradigms for the development of NLME models. Some models, 
called quantitative systems pharmacology models, attempt to feature every element of 
the biological system in mathematical detail (17,18). Others are purely empirical and have 
the barest of structures. In this study, a semi-mechanistic modeling approach has been 
adopted to balance any limitations in the datasets with precise mathematical descriptions 
of NSCLC pathology developed in many previous studies. Semi-mechanistic models 
 
 
 
7 
attempt to balance the desire for biologically relevant mechanisms with limitations in the 
datasets by modeling any prominent pathology with generalized empirical formulations.  
Prior to this study, a preliminary semi-mechanistic model of NSCLC growth 
dynamics was developed in a preclinical experimental setting (19). Scaling this model to 
human biology, it was predicted that scheduling bevacizumab administration 1.2 days 
before pemetrexed-cisplatin administration has the potential to significantly improve 
tumor reduction (>50%) as opposed to concomitant dosing (20). In this follow-up study, 
the aim is to develop a predictive mathematical framework of first- and second-line 
therapeutic drugs for NSCLC by iterating on previous modeling efforts using a large 
(~11,000 patients) clinical trial dataset made available through the Vivli.org database 
(Table 1) (21).  
The overall objectives in the present analysis were to build a model which 1). 
generalizes a previous model of NSCLC growth and response to bevacizumab-
pemetrexed-cisplatin to the greater set of combination therapies and modes of action 
represented in this large clinical database, and 2). characterizes the time-course of 
resistance for those currently registered therapeutics for NSCLC.  
In building this model, several empirical approximations of clinical parameters 
fundamental to cancer modeling have been estimated such as the rate of acquired 
resistance to various pharmaceuticals, the relationship between drug concentration and 
cancer cell death, as well as the fine temporal dynamics of anti-VEGF therapy. Then, 
using this high-powered model, an up-to-date prediction of optimal bevacizumab-
pemetrexed-cisplatin was made, in patients with NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Literature Search and Review 
To build this model, access to data was sought using very broad criteria. Data was 
prioritized from clinical trials where bevacizumab had been used in combination with other 
therapeutics to treat NSCLC. To build on previous modeling efforts, it was necessary for 
studies to include records of individual patient tumor sizes over time. After reviewing 
several potential data custodians to partner with, an application was sent for data access 
through the Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR) portal. Eleven different studies were 
identified which were available through CSDR’s platform which met this study’s 
requirements requirements (Table 1) and access was permitted to a secure server 
containing the datasets beginning on January 6th, 2020. 
Due to contractual obligations between the data administrators (Roche, Eli Lilly) 
and data access provider (CSDR), the project files were moved to a new secure server 
managed by Vivli on September 22nd, 2020. During this transfer process, access to five 
additional datasets was requested involving newer standard-of-care therapeutics and 
NSCLC, but these data were not included in the final modeling dataset. 
 
Data Processing and Collation 
Despite efforts by organizations like The Clinical Data Interchange Standards 
Consortium (CDISC) to standardize dataset creation, internal standards for data 
annotation, units of measurement, file structure, and abbreviated shorthand are highly 
 
 
 
9 
variable between datasets (22). This variability makes collating and preparing large 
datasets for mathematical modeling a challenging and highly error-prone task. 
To reduce the possibility of introducing mistakes into the datasets during collation, 
iterative collation of datasets was systemized. In practice, this meant producing a single 
summary dataset from each study before collating these summary datasets into a 
comma-delimited values file (i.e. .csv). For each study, the data record files containing 
the most relevant information to the study were first identified. The files of primary interest 
contained anonymized individual identifiers, tumor identifiers, tumor pathology, tumor 
size, and drug administration details all organized longitudinally. Data from these files 
were imported directly into R (version 3.5.2) to be normalized for import into the NLME 
parameter estimation software (Monolix Suite version 2020R1, Lixoft). Normalization 
consisted of formatting the data as recommend by Lixoft (15), as well as matching units 
to a dictionary of standards maintained throughout the study. 
After each dataset was produced, the data was explored visually with a 
combination of R 3.5.2 as well as Datxplore software (Monolix Suite version 2020R1, 
Lixoft) to check for potential outliers and errors. Plots produced from the raw imported 
data were compared with plots produced from the transformed data in R 3.5.2 to improve 
quality and consistency in processing. Finally, the individual datasets produced in 
analyzing each study were bound into one single comma separated value file. As a final 
quality check, the final dataset was again re-imported into R 3.5.2, and subset down to 
individual studies. Then, the processed studies were again compared with the raw files 
from the clinical trials for consistency. Data were both received and maintained in a fully 
anonymized format to protect patient privacy.

Non-Linear Mixed Effects Modeling and Characterizing Individual Variation 
The recorded data (yij) were pooled and used to estimate model parameters via 
the stochastic approximation expectation maximization algorithm (SAEM) implemented 
in Monolix (23). After estimating population parameters (μ) and variance, individual 
parameters (ϕi) were estimated using the modes of the individual estimated posterior 
distributions. The posterior distributions were estimated using a Markov-Chain Monte-
Carlo (MCMC) procedure. NLME models were written as previously described (Sheiner 
& Ludden, 1992) (Eq. 1). 
 
Equation 1: 
𝑦!" = 𝐹$𝜙!, 𝛽!, 𝑡!") + 𝐺$𝜙!, 𝑡!") ∙𝜀!" ∨𝜀!" 𝑁(0, 𝜎#) 
𝜙! = ℎ(𝜇, 𝜂!, 𝛽!) ∨𝜂!" 𝑁(0, 𝛺, 𝜔#) 
𝑗∈1, … , 𝑛!, 𝑖∈1, … , 𝑁 
 
Briefly, model predictions (F(ϕi,  βi,  tij)) for the ith individual at the jth timepoint were 
written as a function of individual parameters, individual covariates (βi), and time (tij). The 
residuals were modeled as G(ϕi, tij) ∙ εij. Individual parameters were modeled with function 
h(μ,  ηi, βi). Interindividual variability, ηi, are distributed normally with mean 0, variance-
covariance matrix Ω, and variance ω2. Typically, h(μ,  ηi, βi) is a lognormal link function 
 
 
 
11 
(Eq. 2). In cases where ϕi is bounded, h(μ,  ηi, βi) was typically a logitnormal link function 
(Eq. 3).

Model Building 
The key focal points of this project encompassed the precise modeling of individual 
tumor growth and response, the formulation of a mathematical framework that accounts 
for both acquired and intrinsic resistance, the characterization of individual drug effects 
and interactions, and the modeling of the temporal dynamics underlying tumor 
vascularization improvement through bevacizumab dosing. 
Candidate models were built in multiple development phases. First, previously 
established models of drug pharmacokinetics (PK) were reproduced within the modeling 
project using the Mlxtran language (Monolix Suite version 2020R1, Lixoft) (24). Then, 
several sample datasets were created, with between 5% and 10% of the complete dataset 
for initial model building. This shortened calculation time and reduced computational 
complexity during model building. Next, several base candidate models were chosen for 
NSCLC pharmacodynamics (PD) and were finally implemented using the Mlxtran 
language.  
 
 
 
12 
Two well-established models of NSCLC were used as the base candidate structure 
of tumor growth and drug PD. The first model fit to the data was the Claret model of tumor 
growth and response to antiproliferatives (25). The second model fit was built on a 
previous Gompertzian model of BEV-PEM/CIS (20,26). Initially, all antiproliferatives were 
assumed to operate in a simple log-kill manner (27). 
Finally, using a combination of manual exploration and modified SAEM searches 
with simulated annealing on the ηi terms, several reasonable parameter estimates with 
which to initialize the parameter search were identified. Lastly, the best performing 
candidate models were finalized and compared for performance using quality-of -fit and 
robustness of parameter estimates, as previously described (28–31). Any modifications 
to structure would be iterated on using a similar method and compared using a suite of 
model evaluation techniques. 
 
Model Evaluation 
Quality of fit was determined using both goodness-of-fit plots and summary 
statistics. The stability of parameter estimates was assessed through a combination of 
methods, including examination of the SAEM search, verification of the attainment of 
auto-stop criteria implemented in Monolix, and validation of consistent convergence to 
the same set of parameter estimates when using randomized initial starting parameters 
within a local range. 
Accuracy of individual fits was assessed using a sample of individual plots, an 
observations-vs-predictions plot using the full conditional distribution, a scatter plot of the 
 
 
 
13 
residuals, as well as the corrected Bayesian information criteria (BIC) – estimated via 
importance sampling. 
Assumptions of variance were validated by plotting the conditional distribution 
against theoretical distributions as well as standard statistical tests. Within the NLME 
framework, random effects and residuals are assumed to be predictably distributed – 
usually normally or functionally-linked to normal. The Shapiro-Wilk and Van Der Waerden 
tests were used to determine normality and symmetry of distributions around the mean, 
respectively. Correlation between individual parameters and either other individual 
parameters or covariates were tested with a Pearson’s correlation test or ANOVA, 
respectively. Plotting these relationships assisted in determining the nature of these 
correlations. 
Precision and accuracy of the final model was assessed to evaluate models 
against one another. Precision of parameter estimates was made using relative standard 
error (RSE). Overall model quality (accuracy) of fit was evaluated using the corrected BIC 
(BICc). Diagnostic plots assisted in comparing models with similar overall performance. 
External validation and overfit assessment for the final model were made using 
individualized Bayesian predictions. In short, only 85% of the data was used for model 
building. After the final model was fit, all population parameter estimates were fixed to 
their typical value and the model was then fit to the reserved 15% of the data. The 
goodness-of-fit of the model to the external dataset was used as both an external 
validation tool and for assessing model overfit.

Clinical Trial Simulations 
The objective of the clinical trial simulations was to assess the potential advantages 
of sequential administration of pemetrexed-cisplatin therapy with bevacizumab. For this 
purpose, a cohort of 5,000 virtual individuals was simulated based on the final fit of the 
model, which was subsequently replicated across 31 different sets of test conditions for 
sequential administration of bevacizumab and chemotherapy. These test conditions were 
derived from modifications of the Multicenter Phase II MAP Study of NSCLC (22): 
• Pemetrexed administered every 22 days for 7 cycles at 945 mg and with an 
infusion time of 10 minutes (an average between the administration schedules in 
the datasets, although not aligned with typical standard of care). 
• Cisplatin was administered every 22 days for 3 cycles at 135 mg and with an 
infusion time of 30 minutes.  
• Bevacizumab was administered every 22 days for 7 cycles at 795 mg and with an 
infusion time of 30 minutes. 
The administration of bevacizumab followed the administration of pemetrexed and 
cisplatin with a time gap ranging from 0 to 3 days, in increments of 0.1 days. This 
approach aimed to evaluate whether concurrent administration yielded superior 
outcomes compared to administering bevacizumab after a delayed interval following 
pemetrexed and cisplatin. All simulations were executed using Simulx (Monolix Suite 
version 2023R1, Lixoft). Subsequently, the most effective time gap was identified among 
all the gaps tested within the range of 0 to 3 days.

RESULTS 
Data Summary 
Data were received in directories of fully anonymized data frames (e.g. excel files, 
SAS files, *.csv, etc.) organized by general category of data. For initial data processing, 
data were explored for bulk trends, standardized, and data with suspected errors and 
outliers were removed. Studies were then collated in a single data frame designed for use 
with the Monolix suite (2020R1). Between the 11 studies, 3,686 patients data were 
determined to be potentially suitable for analysis. After exploring the datasets in greater 
detail, 2,586 patients were determined to gather all necessary data to create models of 
tumor growth and response, including unique patient IDs, a time recorded for each dosing 
and measurement event, individual tumor diameter measurements, and details of 
administration (Table 1). See Supplemental 1 for further information on inclusion 
exclusion criteria and the linked publications for further demographic information. Due to 
the massive effort of this study and semi-mechanistic aims, demographic descriptions of 
the dataset are limited in this manuscript. 
The individual tumor longest diameter time-course was chosen as independent 
variable in the model, as the more classical sum of the longest diameters (SLD) did not 
perform as well in semi-mechanistic models of tumor growth in this study. Statistically, all 
patient-tumor combinations were treated as unique subject-occasions. So, within-subject 
inter-tumor variability was included, but no distinction was made between within-subject 
variability and between-subject variability. While acknowledging the potential correlation 
of individual parameters across multiple tumors within an individual, it is important to note 
that the approach described above represents a compromise that strikes a favorable 
balance between modeling systems biology and model parameters structural 
 
 
 
16 
identifiability—a chief example of the types of decisions made when constructing semi-
mechanistic models. Among the subject-occasions, there were 6,197 unique tumors 
belonging to 2,586 patients. 
After a short period of testing, several further restrictions were imposed on the 
dataset to facilitate numerical stability of the modeling. The first condition was that tumors 
were required to have been measured three or more times to qualify for inclusion. This 
reduced the number of unique tumor IDs to 4,701 and unique individuals to 2,036. If for 
each sample 𝑦!", for individual i at time t, 𝑦!"was greater than or equal to 𝑦!"'(, the tumor 
was labeled as a monotonic non-responder and excluded from the dataset. This reduced 
the number of individual tumors to 4,473 and individual IDs to 1,977. After removing these 
data, there were 4,450 tumors and 1,963 individuals left in the dataset. These restrictions 
imposed on the initial dataset representing 2,586 patients reduced the number of samples 
from 29,885 to 26,515. This is an approximate 11% reduction in data. The reduction in 
the dataset size was primarily due to the limited frequency of tumor size assessments 
among the majority of patients in the clinical studies. Lastly, approximately 85% of the 
available data from each study (randomly allocated by subject-tumor pairs) was used for 
model building and the remaining 15% of data was reserved for external validation of the 
final model.  
 
Model Building 
Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated in relatively few of the 
clinical trials referenced herein. Therefore, population pharmacokinetic models were 
collated from scientific literature (Table 2). Between-patient variability in drug 
 
 
 
17 
pharmacokinetics was not included in the pharmacokinetic model as it led to practical 
unidentifiability of random effects parameters. 
For pharmacodynamic modeling, two primary candidates were evaluated for the 
base description of tumor growth and response; 1). the Gompertzian model of tumor 
growth and 2). the Claret model of tumor growth (25,27). Both models describe tumor 
volumes, where the raw data reported tumor longest diameter. The tumor diameters were 
converted into volumes by making the assumption that the tumors were approximately 
spherical in shape. Using the Bayesian information criteria as a parsimonious method of 
cross-evaluating models, the Gompertzian model outperformed the Claret model of tumor 
growth during several stages of structural model development. 
In the Gompertzian model of tumor growth (Eq. 4a), the unperturbed tumor grows 
at a rate α and is exponentially limited in growth by parameter β. 𝑣) is a scaling factor 
relating individual tumor cell turnover to volume (26). It was set to 106 cells/mm3 which is 
the classical assumption of approximate number of cells per unit volume (14).

In Equation 4a, 𝑄* and 𝑄+ are the antiproliferative effects resulting in growth 
reduction and irreversible cell death, respectively. Chemotherapeutics which acted on the 
microtubules – docetaxel and paclitaxel – along with the direct effect of bevacizumab 
were included in 𝑄*. All other therapeutics were modeled as drugs resulting in irreversible 
cell death. Transient enhancement in efficacy via tumor vasculature normalization by 
bevacizumab was modeled as occurring at time (𝑡−𝜏) to account for the time delay 
between administration and efficacy enhancement i.e., 𝜏 (19).  
Equation 4a heavily exaggerated the effect of bevacizumab in limiting cell growth 
rates. To account for this, a second compartment was implemented which represented 
reversible cell injury, 𝑣!:", from which cells could return to the primary volume (i.e. 𝑣) from 
(Eq. 4b). In this equation, elimination rate from tumor cell injury is governed by 
intercompartmental transfer rate 𝑘𝑘!:" as well as proportion of repaired cells returned to 
 
 
 
19 
the unperturbed cycle of proliferation, 𝑝 (value fixed between 0 and 1 using logit-link).  
Noteworthily, the scaling factor 𝑣) was set to the initial tumor volume to tie growth limit to 
initial tumor size. This modified model structure provided a more accurate representation 
of the growth-limiting effects exerted by bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and docetaxel, striking 
a balance that avoided the exaggerated effect observed in Equation 4a. 
Irreversible cell death was modeled as occurring over a series of transitions 
between several compartments with intercompartmental transfer rate 𝑘𝑘. The final tumor 
volume, a summation of the primary tumor volume and death compartments (z1, z2, and 
z3,) as well as injured cell volume 𝑣!:", was then transformed to a tumor diameter to match 
the (observed) independent variable in the dataset (Eq. 5).

For the pharmacodynamic effect (𝑒𝑓𝑓) of the various therapeutics on tumor growth, 
a version of a previously published log-kill model was implemented, whereby each drug 
concentration was scaled by a single parameter (represented by 𝑤8 for weighting for drug 
𝑑) and the weighted sum of those concentrations determined the overall cytotoxic effect 
(Eq. 6a). 𝑐𝑐8(𝑡) represents the concentration of drug 𝑑 at any arbitrary time 𝑡. This 
formulation proved slightly unstable, so the sum of effects was eventually grouped under 
an inverse logit function, so that this sum would be bounded to a value comprised 
between 0 and 1 (Eq. 6b). After several more iterations of the model, the fit was further 
improved by individualizing drug effects relative therapeutic mechanism of action.  
Lastly, resistance to anticancer treatment was modeled using a variant of an 
exposure-response model (32). In this mathematical representation, the tumor cells were 
assumed to become increasingly more resistant to treatment (rate governed by parameter 
𝜆8) as a function of drug exposure (area under the concentration time-curve, AUC) – Eq. 
6c. Additionally, the effect of drugs with similar mechanisms of action were weighted 
relative to each other—i.e. 𝑤8%&'()&* represents the weight of some drug (given the 
arbitrary index 1) relative to some other drug (drug 2) which shares a mechanism of 
action, e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin. A complete diagram of the model is available for 
review in Figure 1.

Individual variability was modeled using the standard lognormal distribution and 
initial tumor volumes were fixed to the measurement of the tumor at time 0, relative to 
each individual. The only exception was made for parameter p which was fixed between 
0 and 1 using a logit-link function (Eq. 7). At last, measurement error was modeled using 
 
 
 
22 
the function combined 1 in Monolix, i.e., including a single additive term (a) added with a 
single proportional term (b).

Model Diagnostics 
Graphical evaluation of model diagnostics support the validity and predictive 
performances of the final selected model. Specifically, the SAEM search was stable and 
reliable when estimating the final set of parameter estimates (Figure 2). Individual fits 
were reasonably descriptive with both a well captured tumor growth inhibition in response 
to treatment and rebound after treatment cessation (Figure 3). After evidence of 
correlations (via Pearson’s test) between individual effects was observed, those 
correlations were investigated using the full posterior plot of individual effects. Although 
several potential correlations were discovered, the slopes of these correlations were 
nearly zero and they were likely detected in error (type 1) as an effect of working with 
such a large dataset (increased statistical power). An even spread of observations vs. 
individual predictions suggests that this model has no major structural misspecifications 
and that the error model was well specified (Figure 4). However, formal tests for residual 
normality and centering on zero failed. This is likely because of the use of the initial 
 
 
 
23 
measured tumor volume as the predicted tumor volume at time 0 (i.e. residual is equal to 
0) and the conservative estimate of a lower limit of detection of 1 mm for measuring tumor 
diameter. Once removing the points below the limit of detection and the points measured 
at time 0, the residual error model aligned much more closely with the theoretical model. 
The spread of individual parameters met the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. The 
precision of parameter estimates was extremely high (RSE < 8%) with low correlation 
between estimates. Shrinkage of individual parameter distributions toward the mean was 
low. Full parameter estimates, IIV, and RSEs are reported in Table 3. The visual 
predictive check (VPC) was informative as to wholistic model performance. Although the 
clinical trials were not matched in terms of sampling schedule, the VPC still indicates 
overall high-quality fit (Figure 5). 
 
External Validation 
The model was externally validated using the reserved 15% of the data not used 
during the model building process. Individual parameters were found for each subject, but 
population parameter estimates, IIV, and error parameters were all fixed to the value 
found in the final model fit. Model diagnostics were used to assess the ability of the model 
to make predictions on new patients which were not part of the original dataset. Using the 
VPC as an overall diagnostic tool (Figure 6), the final model fit the external data extremely 
well with little misspecification except in the lower prediction interval band. This VPC was 
produced without re-estimating the population parameters, so it is a diagnostic for the fit 
of the model to an external dataset. Then, the reserved 15% of data was reduced to three 
subsets, one consisting of only the first datapoint for each patient, another consisting of 
 
 
 
24 
only the first two datapoints, and a third consisting of only the first three datapoints. 
Individual predictions for each simulation scenario were compared between the three 
datasets to assess the quality of the model’s individual predictions (Figure 7). The model 
could be used to predict the efficacy of individual treatment time courses with a mean 
error rate of 59.7% after a single tumor measurement and 11.7% after three successive 
tumor measurements. 
 
Clinical Trial Simulations 
Clinical trial simulations indicated that of the patients who did not go into complete 
remission in symptoms from standard concomitant therapy, a majority would have seen 
some percentage in improvement if they had received bevacizumab before pemetrexed-
cisplatin. The ideal predicted gap, in steps of 0.1 days, for patients receiving 
bevacizumab-pemetrexed-cisplatin therapy was 0.4 days or 9.6 hours (Figure 8). At this 
gap, approximately 93.5% of patients benefited from a gap in sequential administration. 
Of those patients, the mean improvement was 20.7%. The mean improvement in patients 
at the more practical gaps of 12 and 24 hours were 15.7% and 14.3%, respectively. 
 
DISCUSSION 
The primary objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive semi-
mechanistic model that encompasses the growth and response of non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) to various clinical antiproliferative treatments. The model produced in 
this study effectively incorporates the antiproliferative effects of 11 different anti-NSCLC 
therapeutics used in 11 clinical trials, accounting for both intrinsic and acquired resistance 
 
 
 
25 
to anticancer therapy. To accomplish this, the most reliable published pharmacokinetic 
(PK) models for these therapeutics has been integrated into this model, opting not to 
estimate interindividual variability for PK. The final selected model comprehensively 
demonstrates transient enhancement of perfusion resulting from anti-VEGF therapy, 
particularly bevacizumab. The individual predictions derived from this model exhibit a 
relatively high degree of precision, effectively capturing the well-established rebound in 
growth that follows the cessation of treatment in non-small cell lung cancer.  
While modeling resistance to treatment, AUC was used as a surrogate of drug 
exposure to model acquired resistance. AUC serves as a meaningful metric for modeling 
drug exposure, as it is an easily measurable parameter in a clinical setting. It provides a 
comprehensive representation of the concentration-time profile of a drug, taking into 
account both the peak concentration and the duration of exposure. By quantifying the 
total drug exposure over a specified period, AUC enables comparisons across different 
dosing regimens and facilitates the evaluation of drug efficacy and safety. Therefore, 
incorporating AUC into the modeling framework allowed for a robust characterization of 
drug exposure and its relationship to clinical outcomes. Intrinsic resistance has been 
folded into the distribution of wd (i.e., weighting) terms in this system of equations. A 
known weakness in this approach to modeling resistance is that, while capturing a 
distribution of resistance time courses with respect to exposure, this model has not 
accounted for the individual systems and pathophysiology that might better explain and 
characterize that resistance (33). 
During this investigation, it was discovered that incorporating a second cytotoxic 
effect to account for reversible cellular injury proved essential in capturing both the direct 
 
 
 
26 
effects of bevacizumab and the impact of medications known to induce reversible cell 
injury, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel. By employing a predominantly linear combination 
of differential equation terms, this model offers a seamless avenue for integrating 
additional drug candidates and further system-level details. Moreover, a set of parameter 
estimates has been meticulously derived and rigorously validated, and the model code 
has been made openly accessible (see data sharing statement) for future research 
endeavors focused on non-small cell lung cancer. This transparency and availability aim 
to facilitate scientific progress and enhance the understanding of NSCLC dynamics and 
therapeutic interventions. 
When evaluating the predictive performance of the model, strong evidence was 
observed in support of model structure choice. Parameter estimates and individual 
predictions were made with high precision, which is likely due to the largeness of the 
dataset included. Model structure was based on biological mechanisms and interpretation 
of parameters is relatively straightforward – e.g. λ parameters define the rate of acquired 
resistance vs. exposure. Mechanisms grounded in biology afford the model additional 
longevity. On parameter estimate interpretation, relatively simple naming heuristics were 
used to aid in interpretation. wd parameters weight drug action against the tumor i.e., the 
larger the wd parameter, the larger the action the drug takes proportionally to both the 
tumor size and concentration of the drug in plasma. The parameter p indicates the 
proportion of cells in the injured volume which return to unperturbed tumor growth. 
Unperturbed tumor growth is governed by parameters α (exponential rate of growth of 
tumor) and β (exponential rate of decrease in growth rate due to nutrient supply 
limitations). 
 
 
 
27 
There are several weaknesses which need to be acknowledged in this approach 
and addressed in future studies. Large amounts of data on cutting-edge first-line 
therapies–i.e. pembrolizumab and other immune-checkpoint inhibitors–were not included 
at this time. There are also several covariates, such as weight, body surface area, gender, 
and concomitant disease which have not been included or tested in the model. Lastly, 
this modeling project was semi-mechanistic in its aims. This is partially due to the nature 
of measurements of tumor size made in a clinical trial. Those measurements are sparsely 
made and strongly influenced by the technicians performing tumor measurements. There 
was a richness in sampling between clinical trials, but within any patient sampling was 
infrequent.  This resulted in imprecise modeling heuristics such as modeling resistance 
as a function of AUC. However, the platform produced in this study is heavily informed by 
clinical practice and will make an impactful platform for further iteration informed by either 
more mechanistic mechanisms or AI modeling methods (34–37). 
One of the primary features that this model was designed to capture is the transient 
enhancement of drug delivery after bevacizumab administration. Theoretically, this 
transient enhancement drives the synergism between bevacizumab and other 
antiproliferatives. Potentially some other biological phenomenon may drive the synergism 
between bevacizumab and other antiproliferatives, but this model is ultimately agnostic 
about the precise biological mechanism of synergism. A natural conclusion, and a finding 
supported by previously published clinical papers (19,38–42), is that administering 
bevacizumab before other antiproliferatives should result in the greatest reduction in 
tumor size. A delay of 9.6 hours between pemetrexed-cisplatin and bevacizumab resulted 
in the greatest benefit to the virtual patients. At this gap, approximately 93.5% of patients 
 
 
 
28 
benefited from a gap in sequential administration. Of those patients, the mean 
improvement was 20.7%. The mean improvement in patients at the more practical gaps 
of 12 and 24 hours were 15.7% and 14.3%, respectively. This is within a factor of 3 to the 
prediction of optimal gap made in Schneider, et al. 2019 (1.2 days) using experimental 
data from xenograft mice (20). In the future, this model could be adapted to meet standard 
clinical endpoints of late-stage NSCLC clinical trials such as survival (OS) and  
progression-free survival (PFS) with RECIST criteria. (43). 
 
Conclusion and Future Directions 
This research provides a simulation platform for future in silico studies of optimal 
scheduling of various therapeutics. The individual Bayesian predictions made in the 
reserved 15% of data showed that the model had little overfitting and can be extended to 
external datasets. Mean errors in individual predictions with 1, 2, or 3 sampled points 
were extremely low, even for far off successive timepoints. For future clinical therapy, this 
study reaffirms, in human patients, the advantage of staggering bevacizumab, 
pemetrexed and cisplatin therapy.  Lastly, this platform is well supported within the 
context of this study, but with careful refinement and further validation this model is flexible 
enough to be adapted to accelerating preclinical predictions in related antiproliferatives. 
Further research using newer modalities such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and newer 
methods such as AI-powered modeling will benefit greatly from this significant modeling 
effort.

FIGURES 
Figure 1 Diagram of the Systems Pharmacology Model 
 
Comment: In the Gompertzian model of tumor growth the unperturbed tumor grows at a rate α and is exponentially 
limited in growth by parameter β. When a cytotoxic is introduced into the system, the cytotoxic impairs the growth 
of the tumor by sending cells into a death succession governed by kk. The cytotoxic death relative to drug 
concentration is modeled as Qγ. Reversible cell injury relative to drug concentration is modeled as Qρ. τ is the time 
delay between bevacizumab administration and perfusion enhancement effect in the tumor. When a cell is damaged 
by cytotoxics or reversible cell injury that progresses to irreversible cell injury, it begins a progression from 
unperturbed growth—compartment V(t)—to damage compartments Z1 through Z1. Eventually the cell exits the 
tumor volume as it dies.

Figure 2 SAEM Search
 
Comment: Stochastic approximation expectation maximization search for most likely estimates of parameter 
values. Exploratory search in black and smoothing search in red. Omega stands for the standard deviation of the 
random effects. 
 
Figure 3 Sample of Individual Model Fits 
 
Comment: Several individual fits (black continuous line) vs observations (black dots). There’s some evidence of 
overfitting, but the model reproduces a broad range of behaviors over long study periods. 
 
Figure 4 Observations vs. Predictions Goodness-of-Fits 
 
 
 
37 
 
Comment: In this figure the observations vs predictions (black points) are plotted along with censored data (red 
points). Solid line is where observations meet predictions i.e. ratio is 1. Error model 95% prediction boundaries at 
dotted blue lines. Spline is in yellow. Points are semitransparent to reduce visual overcrowding of data. Relative 
agreement between spline and line of best fit indicates the overall precision of fit. 
 
Figure 5 Visual Predictive Check for the Model Fit Using 85% of the Full Dataset (Internal Validation) 
 
Comment: The empirical median tumor longest diameter (central blue line) and upper and lower empirical 90% 
quantiles (upper and lower blue lines) are predicted precisely by the model fit prediction intervals. The 90% 
prediction intervals for the median tumor longest diameter (red band) and upper and lower 90% quantiles (blue 
bands) capture the majority of the variation in the dataset. 
 
Figure 6 Visual Predictive Check Using 15% of the Full Dataset (Reserved Set: External Validation) 
 
 
 
38 
 
Comment: The empirical median tumor longest diameter (central blue line) and upper and lower empirical 90% 
quantiles (upper and lower blue lines) are predicted precisely by the model fit prediction intervals. The 90% 
prediction intervals for the median tumor longest diameter (red band) and upper and lower 90% quantiles (blue 
bands) capture the majority of the variation in the dataset. 
 
Figure 7 Individual Bayesian Predictions After Limited Sampling 
 
 
 
 
39 
Comment: This test was used to assess overfitting in the model. The reserved 15% of data was reduced to three 
subsets, one consisting of only the first datapoint for each patient, another consisting of only the first two timepoints, 
and a third consisting of only the first three timepoints. Individual predictions for each were compared between the 
three datasets to assess the quality of the model’s individual predictions. The model could be used to predict the 
efficacy of individual treatment time courses with a mean error rate of 59.7% after a single measurement and 11.7% 
after three successive measurements. 
 
Figure 8 Impact of Gap in Scheduling on Overall Efficacy 
 
Comment: This plot is a combination of a histogram and heatmap for determining the gap where simulated patients 
saw improvement from delayed bevacizumab treatment. The blue color is the intensity of improvement over 
concomitant dosing for the simulated patient population at the specified gap in days. The highest intensity of 
improvement is at a gap of 9.6 hours, or 0.4 days. On the lefthand side, the axis represents percent of patients. After 
approximately 5 days, there’s no longer any improvement gained from delaying bevacizumab administration.

Comment: Data was originally obtained from clinicalstudydataresearch.com, but later during the project Vivli 
became the custodian of the datasets. During this transition, six more clinical trial datasets representing immune 
checkpoint inhibitors were added to the repository, but data were not able to be made anonymized and available in 
time for the modeling project. By following the links to the readers can learn further information about dataset 
demographics.

Comment: SE is the standard error of the estimate and RSE is the relative standard error of the estimate. IIV is the 
interindividual variability, or in practical terms the standard deviation of the random effects . wdrug parameters are 
unitless and represent the weight of effect of the treatment modality on Gompertzian growth. λd parameters are also 
unitless and represent the effect of AUC on the effectiveness of the relative treatment modalities. a and b are error 
model parameters and therefore have no IIV.
