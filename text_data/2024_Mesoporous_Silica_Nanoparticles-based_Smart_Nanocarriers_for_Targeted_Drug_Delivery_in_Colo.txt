ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, highlighting the 
urgent need for advanced therapeutic strategies. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have emerged as a promising 
approach to improve the specificity and efficacy of anticancer treatments. This review examines three cutting-edge 
mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-based drug delivery to introduce novel CRC therapy, each utilizing unique 
functionalization strategies for targeted drug release. The first system, hyaluronidase-responsive MSN-HA/DOX, employs 
biotin-modified hyaluronic acid to facilitate dual-stimulus drug release in the tumor microenvironment, exhibiting enhanced

1. Introduction 
  Colorectal cancer remains one of the most significant 
global health challenges, ranking as the third most 
diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-
related deaths worldwide. Despite advances in early 
detection and treatment, the five-year survival rate for 
CRC, especially in advanced metastatic stages, remains 
suboptimal. Conventional chemotherapy, though widely 
used, is often hindered by its non-specific nature, leading 
to systemic toxicity and undesirable side effects, which 
severely limit the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs. 
To address these limitations, novel drug delivery systems 
have been developed, with the aim of enhancing the 
targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the tumor 
site, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and 
reducing off-target effects. 
  Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising solution in 
the design of targeted drug delivery, particularly for 
cancer therapy. Nanoparticles, due to their unique 
physicochemical properties such as small size, large 
surface area-to-volume ratio, and tunable surface 
chemistry, offer several advantages over traditional drug 
delivery methods. They can enhance drug solubility, 
prolong systemic circulation, and provide controlled and 
sustained drug release. Moreover, nanoparticles can be 
functionalized by targeting ligands that recognize and 
bind to specific receptors overexpressed on cancer cells, 
enabling precise drug delivery to the tumor site. Among 
the various types of nanoparticles investigated for cancer 
therapy, mesoporous silica nanoparticles have garnered 
considerable attention due to their highly tunable 
structure, biocompatibility, bioavailability and ease of 
surface modification. 
  MSNs possess a well-defined porous structure that 
allows for high drug loading capacity and controlled 
release of therapeutic agents. Their large surface area and 
the ability to functionalize their surface with various 
targeting molecules make them ideal candidates for the 
design of advanced drug delivery systems. Furthermore, 
MSNs can be engineered to respond to specific stimuli 
within the tumor microenvironment, such as pH, redox 
potential, or enzymatic activity, enabling the release of 
the therapeutic payload only in the presence of these 
triggers, thus minimizing systemic toxicity. 
  In this review, we discuss three recent advancements in 
MSN-based gated drug delivery systems designed for 
colorectal cancer therapy. These systems incorporate 
innovative functionalization strategies to enhance drug 
targeting, delivery, and release. The first system, 
hyaluronidase-responsive nanoparticles, employs biotin-
modified hyaluronic acid (HA) to target cancer cells 
expressing hyaluronidase, a key enzyme in tumor 
progression. The second system utilizes dual-modified 
doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded silica nanoparticles with 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) and biotin, offering improved 
stability and targeted drug delivery to cancer cells with 
overexpressed biotin receptors. Finally, the third system 
explores galactosylated chitosan-functionalized MSNs, 
which enhance drug uptake through receptor-mediated 
endocytosis via asialoglycoprotein receptors, particularly 
targeting liver and colon cancer cells. 
  This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview 
of these advanced drug delivery systems, highlighting 
their design, functionality, and therapeutic potential for 
colorectal cancer treatment. By discussing the unique 
properties of each system, we aim to emphasize the 
potential 
of 
MSN-based 
targeted 
delivery 
to 
revolutionize the treatment of CRC, addressing the unmet 
need for more effective and less toxic cancer therapies. 
Moreover, we will discuss the future direction of this 
field, particularly the challenges of clinical translation 
and the potential for these systems to be scaled up for 
broad clinical application. 
2. Hyaluronidase-Responsive Nanoparticles for Colon 
Cancer Therapy 
2.1 Design and Functionalization 
  Zhang et al. developed a highly innovative mesoporous 
silica nanoparticle-based drug delivery system (MSN-
HA/DOX) that utilizes the enzymatic activity of 
hyaluronidase (HAase) to achieve targeted drug release 
for colon cancer therapy. Hyaluronidase, an enzyme 
found to be overexpressed in several cancers, including 
colorectal cancer (CRC), is involved in degrading 
hyaluronic acid (HA), a key component of the 
extracellular matrix. By exploiting this enzymatic 
overexpression in tumor microenvironments, the MSN-
HA/DOX system aims to enhance therapeutic specificity.

MSN-HA; scale bar, 50 nm. (B) Zeta potentials of MSN-NH2, 
MSN-desthiobiotin, and MSN-HA were measured. MSN-NH2 
and MSN-desthiobiotin showed a positive surface charge; 
after grafting HA, surface charge was changed to negative, 
indicating the successful link of HA (n=3). Reproduced with 
permission from [7] 
  The mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) in this 
system were functionalized with hyaluronic acid (HA), 
modified with biotin for dual purposes: targeting CRC 
tumor cells and achieving controlled drug release. Biotin 
was selected due to the presence of biotin receptors that 
are overexpressed in various cancer cells, including 
colorectal cancer. This biotin-modified HA not only 
enables the nanoparticle to target HAase-expressing 
tumor cells but also acts as a ‘gatekeeper’ to control the 
release of the encapsulated drug, doxorubicin (Dox). By 
integrating both biotin and HA, the system achieves a 
synergistic effect, ensuring that drug release occurs 
specifically at the tumor site, driven by the enzymatic 
activity of HAase. 
2.2 Drug Release and Targeting 
  The core mechanism of drug release in the MSN-
HA/Dox system is based on a dual-stimulus approach 
involving hyaluronidase and biotin. The biotin-modified 
HA serves as a surface coating or ‘gate’ that blocks the 
release of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin until 
the nanoparticle encounters its targeted environment, i.e., 
the 
tumor 
microenvironment. 
In 
this 
design, 
hyaluronidase degrades the HA coating, digesting the 
gatekeeping agent and releasing the encapsulated DOX. 
This degradation is vital because it ensures that the drug 
is delivered specifically at the tumor site, where 
hyaluronidase activity is elevated, minimizing the release 
of DOX in healthy tissues. 
  Furthermore, the biotin-functionalization contributes an 
additional layer of specificity, enhancing the tumor-
targeting ability of the nanoparticles. Colorectal cancer 
cells are known to overexpress biotin receptors, which 
allows the biotin-modified nanoparticles to more 
effectively bind to the tumor cells, leading to higher drug 
accumulation at the cancer site. Once in proximity to the 
tumor cells, the HAase present in the tumor 
microenvironment breaks down the HA shell, triggering 
a targeted release of Dox directly into the cancer cells. 
This dual-stimulus-responsive approach 
not only 
improves drug localization but also reduces the off-target 
side effects typically associated with chemotherapeutic 
agents like doxorubicin. 
2.3 In Vitro and In Vivo Studies 
  In vitro studies conducted by Zhang et al. demonstrated 
the effectiveness of the MSN-HA/DOX system in CRC 
cells. The results showed that the nanoparticles exhibited 
significantly enhanced drug release in the presence of 
hyaluronidase and biotin, which were able to selectively 
trigger the release of DOX. The system demonstrated 
high biocompatibility and efficient uptake by CRC cells, 
leading to enhanced therapeutic outcomes. Notably, the 
study showed that in the presence of HAase, the DOX 
release was highly controlled and precise, confirming the 
enzyme's role in targeting drug delivery specifically to 
cancer cells. 
  In vivo experiments further validated the potential of 
MSN-HA/DOX for colorectal cancer therapy. CRC 
xenograft models were used to test the system's 
therapeutic efficacy. The results were highly promising: 
MSN-HA/DOX showed superior anti-tumor activity 
compared to free DOX, with significant inhibition of 
tumor growth. Importantly, the targeted nature of the 
MSN-HA/DOX system led to minimal systemic toxicity, 
a common side effect in conventional chemotherapy. The 
dual-stimulus-responsive design, based on HAase 
activity and biotin targeting, ensured that the drug was 
delivered with high precision to the tumor site, thereby 
enhancing the treatment's efficacy while minimizing 
adverse effects on healthy tissues.

3. Doxorubicin-Loaded MSNs with Dual Modification 
3.1 Design and Functionalization 
  A novel drug delivery system based on doxorubicin-
loaded silica nanoparticles (DOX/SLN-PEG-Biotin) was 
developed by Lin et al. (2018), which integrated two key 
modifications to optimize the performance of the 
nanoparticles in colorectal cancer therapy. The first 
modification involved the addition of polyethylene glycol 
to the surface of the silica nanoparticles. PEGylation is a 
well-established strategy in nanomedicine, as it improves 
the pharmacokinetic profile of nanoparticles by 
increasing their stability in the circulatory system. 
Specifically, 
PEG 
reduces 
protein 
adsorption 
(opsonization), which typically leads to rapid clearance 
of nanoparticles from the bloodstream by the immune 
system. By adding PEG to the nanoparticle surface, Lin 
et al. effectively prolonged the circulation time of the 
drug-loaded nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the 
chances of drug accumulation at the tumor site. 
  A vitamin biotin was conjugated to the surface of the 
nanoparticles to target biotin receptors, which are 
overexpressed on the surface of various cancer cells, 
including colorectal cancer cells. Biotin-functionalized 
nanoparticles have shown strong targeting potential due 
to the increased presence of biotin receptors in tumor 
cells compared to normal tissues. This dual modification 
of the nanoparticles, combining PEG for increased 
circulation time and biotin for targeted delivery, aimed to 
maximize the therapeutic efficacy of the targeted delivery 
while minimizing off-target toxicity. 
3.2 Drug Release and Cellular Uptake 
  The DOX/SLN-PEG-Biotin system was designed with 
a smart drug release mechanism, triggered by the 
intracellular environment of cancer cells. Once the biotin-
functionalized nanoparticles reach the tumor site, they are 
taken up by cancer cells through receptor-mediated 
endocytosis, facilitated by the biotin ligands binding to 
the overexpressed biotin receptors on CRC cells. This 
ensures that the drug-loaded nanoparticles are selectively 
internalized by the cancer cells, reducing the chances of 
drug uptake by healthy cells. 
  Once inside the cancer cells, the nanoparticles encounter 
high concentrations of intracellular glutathione (GSH), 
which is known to be abundant in cancer cells due to their 
altered redox state. The DOX/SLN-PEG-Biotin system 
exploits this characteristic by incorporating disulfide 
bonds into the structure of the nanoparticles. These 
disulfide bonds are stable under normal physiological 
conditions but get cleaved in the presence of high levels 
of GSH. The cleavage of these bonds inside the cancer 
cells triggers the rapid release of doxorubicin from the 
nanoparticles, allowing for site-specific drug release. 
  This GSH-triggered release mechanism is particularly 
advantageous because it ensures that Dox is only released 
once the nanoparticles are inside the cancer cells, thereby 
minimizing premature drug release and reducing 
systemic toxicity. By using biotin for targeting and GSH 
for intracellular release, the DOX/SLN-PEG-Biotin 
system provides a highly selective and efficient means of 
delivering chemotherapeutic agents to CRC cells. 
3.3 In Vitro and In Vivo Studies 
  In vitro studies conducted by Lin et al. demonstrated the 
enhanced targeting and drug release capabilities of the 
DOX/SLN-PEG-Biotin system. Using HCT116 colon 
cancer cells as the model system, the biotin-
functionalized nanoparticles exhibited significantly 
higher cellular uptake compared to non-targeted 
nanoparticles. This enhanced uptake was attributed to the 
specific interaction between biotin ligands on the 
nanoparticles and biotin receptors overexpressed on the 
surface of CRC cells. The study confirmed that the 
targeted nanoparticles were efficiently internalized by the 
cancer cells, while the non-targeted nanoparticles showed 
limited cellular uptake, supporting the role of biotin in 
improving tumor targeting. 
  Furthermore, the drug release profile of the DOX/SLN-
PEG-Biotin system showed accelerated release of Dox in 
the presence of intracellular GSH. This confirmed the 
GSH-triggered 
release 
mechanism, 
with 
the 
nanoparticles releasing their drug payload more rapidly 
in the reductive environment of cancer cells compared to 
normal cells, where GSH levels are significantly lower. 
This selective release mechanism further enhances the 
therapeutic potential of the system by ensuring that the 
drug is primarily released in the tumor cells, thus 
improving efficacy and reducing systemic side effects. 
  In vivo studies using a colorectal cancer mouse model 
further validated the therapeutic potential of the 
DOX/SLN-PEG-Biotin system. Mice treated with the 
biotin-functionalized nanoparticles showed a significant 
reduction in tumor growth compared to those treated with 
free DOX or non-targeted nanoparticles. The biotin-
targeted drug delivery exhibited strong anti-cancer 
efficacy, with notable tumor inhibition and minimal 
adverse effects. Importantly, the PEGylation of the 
nanoparticles 
reduced 
their 
clearance 
from 
the 
bloodstream, allowing for prolonged circulation and 
increased drug accumulation at the tumor site.

Biotin in PBS 7.4 pH with and without 10 mM GSH (left), in

permission from [8] 
  The DOX/SLN-PEG-Biotin system's ability to combine 
biotin-mediated targeting, GSH-triggered drug release, 
and prolonged circulation time resulted in a highly 
effective treatment for CRC with reduced systemic 
toxicity. The in vivo results demonstrated that the system 
provided superior anti-tumor activity and minimal 
adverse 
effects 
compared 
to 
conventional 
chemotherapeutic approaches, highlighting its potential 
for clinical applications in cancer therapy. 
4. Galactosylated Chitosan-functionalized MSNs for 
Targeted Drug Delivery 
4.1 Design and Functionalization 
  Liu et al. (2018) developed an innovative drug delivery 
based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles functionalized 
with galactosylated chitosan (GC) to improve targeted 
drug delivery for colorectal cancer. Chitosan, a natural 
polysaccharide with biocompatible and biodegradable 
properties, was chosen as the base material for 
modification due to its excellent film-forming and 
mucoadhesive qualities. To enhance the targeting 
efficiency, the chitosan was modified with galactose 
moieties, aiming to exploit the overexpression of 
asialoglycoprotein receptors on CRC and liver cancer 
cells. 
  Asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPR) are particularly 
overexpressed in liver and colon cancer cells, making 
them an ideal target for receptor-mediated endocytosis. 
By attaching galactose molecules to chitosan, Liu et al. 
engineered the nanoparticles to have a higher affinity for 
these receptors. This galactose-modified chitosan coating 
served two critical functions: it allowed the MSNs to 
selectively target cancer cells via ASGPR and facilitated 
the internalization of the nanoparticles into CRC cells 
through receptor-mediated endocytosis. This design was 
intended to improve the specific delivery of hydrophobic 
chemotherapeutic agents to CRC cells, thereby 
enhancing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing off-
target effects.

(right). Reproduced with permission from [9] 
4.2 Drug Release and Targeting 
  The GC-functionalized MSNs were designed to provide 
both targeted drug delivery and controlled release of 
chemotherapeutic agents, optimizing the therapeutic 
effect. The galactose ligands on the surface of the MSNs 
enable the nanoparticles to bind specifically to 
asialoglycoprotein receptors overexpressed on CRC 
cells, 
leading 
to 
enhanced 
receptor-mediated 
endocytosis. This targeting mechanism ensures that the 
drug-loaded nanoparticles are preferentially taken up by 
CRC cells, improving the accumulation of the therapeutic 
agent at the tumor site. 
  Once inside the cancer cells, the mesoporous structure 
of the MSNs facilitates controlled and sustained drug 
release. The large surface area and tunable pore size of 
the MSNs provide an ideal matrix for loading 
hydrophobic drugs. This sustained release profile 
minimizes premature drug leakage during systemic 
circulation, ensuring that most of the drug reaches the 
target site before being released. By delivering the drug 
in a controlled manner within the tumor cells, the system 
enhances the therapeutic effect while minimizing 
systemic toxicity. This precise control over drug release 
helps maintain an effective concentration of the drug at 
the tumor site over a prolonged period, improving the 
efficacy of the treatment. 
4.3 In Vitro and In Vivo Studies 
  Liu et al. conducted a series of in vitro studies to 
evaluate the effectiveness of GC-functionalized MSNs 
for targeted drug delivery to CRC cells. The results 
showed that the nanoparticles exhibited significantly 
enhanced cellular uptake by CRC cells, primarily through 
receptor-mediated 
endocytosis 
facilitated 
by 
the 
galactose ligands. Compared to non-functionalized 
MSNs, the GC-functionalized MSNs demonstrated a 
marked increase in internalization by cancer cells, 
confirming the role of ASGPR in targeting and uptake. 
This targeted delivery system exhibited excellent 
biocompatibility, with minimal cytotoxicity observed in 
normal cells, indicating that the functionalization with 
galactosylated chitosan did not compromise the safety 
profile of the nanoparticles. 
  Moreover, the GC-functionalized MSNs displayed a 
sustained drug release profile, further enhancing their 
therapeutic potential. The controlled release of the drug 
within CRC cells led to significant cytotoxic effects, 
resulting in enhanced cancer cell death compared to non-
targeted systems. The in vitro studies provided 
compelling evidence of the system’s ability to deliver 
chemotherapeutic agents effectively while maintaining 
control over drug release kinetics.

FU@MSN-NH2/GC at pH 7.4 pH environment. Reproduced

  In vivo studies further demonstrated the therapeutic 
efficacy of GC-functionalized MSNs in a CRC mouse 
model. The results showed improved drug distribution 
within tumor tissues, with the nanoparticles exhibiting a 
higher accumulation in the cancerous tissues compared to 
free drug formulations. The targeted delivery of the drug 
reduced 
the 
systemic 
distribution 
of 
the 
chemotherapeutic agent, leading to a significant decrease 
in off-target toxicity and adverse side effects typically 
associated with conventional chemotherapy. 
  The GC-functionalized MSNs showed superior tumor 
inhibition, with marked reduction in tumor size and 
improved survival rates in the treated mice. The in vivo 
experiments confirmed that the system not only enhanced 
drug accumulation in the tumor tissue but also provided 
sustained and controlled drug release, leading to better 
therapeutic outcomes. The reduction in systemic toxicity, 
coupled with the improved efficacy, highlighted the 
potential of this DDS for clinical applications in CRC 
therapy. 
 
5. Conclusion 
  The development of advanced mesoporous silica 
nanoparticle-based 
drug 
delivery 
systems 
shows 
significant promise for enhancing colorectal cancer 
treatment. 
The 
reviewed 
systems, 
including 
hyaluronidase-responsive MSN-HA/DOX, DOX/SLN-
PEG-Biotin, and galactosylated chitosan-functionalized 
MSNs, demonstrate how functionalization can improve 
drug targeting, stability, and controlled release, resulting 
in better therapeutic outcomes. Each approach offers 
distinct advantages: the MSN-HA/Dox system utilizes 
enzymatic activity for precise drug release in the tumor 
microenvironment; the DOX/SLN-PEG-Biotin system 
improves drug stability and targets biotin-overexpressing 
cancer 
cells; 
and 
the 
galactosylated 
chitosan-
functionalized MSNs enhance drug delivery through 
receptor-mediated 
endocytosis. 
Collectively, 
these 
advancements address the limitations of conventional 
chemotherapy, such as systemic toxicity and non-specific 
distribution. Future research should prioritize the clinical 
translation of these systems, focusing on scalability, 
safety, and efficacy in diverse patient populations while 
also optimizing nanoparticle formulations and exploring 
combinations with other therapeutic modalities for a 
more integrated approach to colorectal cancer treatment.
