Iron oxide (e.g., Fe3O4 or  -Fe2O3) nanoparticles are promising candidates for a variety 
of biomedical applications ranging from magnetic hyperthermia therapy to drug delivery 
and bio-detection, due to their superparamagnetism, non-toxicity, and biodegradability. 
While particles of small size (below a critical size, ~20 nm) display superparamagnetic 
behavior at room temperature, these particles tend to penetrate highly sensitive areas of 
the body such as the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), leading to undesired effects. In addition, 
these particles possess a high probability of retention, which can lead to genotoxicity and 
biochemical toxicity. Increasing particle size is a means for addressing these problems but 
also suppresses the superparamagnetism. We have overcome this particle size limit by 
synthesizing unique polycrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles composed of multiple 
nanocrystals of 10 to 15 nm size while tuning particle size from 160 to 400 nm. These so-
called superparticles preserve superparamagnetic characteristics and exhibit excellent 
hyperthermia responses. The specific absorption rates (SAR) exceed 250 W/g (HAC = 800 
Oe, f = 310 kHz) at a low concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, indicating their capability in cancer 
treatment with minimum dose. Our study underscores the potential of size-tunable

Introduction 
Nanotechnology, the science of material manipulation at the atomic level, continues to 
play a significant role in everyday applications.[1–5] Its impact spans across diverse fields, 
including electronics, computing, medicine, healthcare, energy, and environmental sectors. 
Traditionally, the dimensions, shapes, and compositions of materials have been central to 
nanotechnology research.[6,7] However, these parameters have become secondary to the control 
of phase-tunability and structural ordering, which allows for the fine-tuning of nanostructures 
for current and future applications.[8–13]  
Magnetic hyperthermia therapy utilizes magnetic nanoparticles (magnetite Fe3O4 or 
maghemite -Fe2O3) to generate heat through the induction of an alternating current (AC) 
magnetic field.[14–18] When exposed to this AC magnetic field, magnetic nanoparticles can 
elevate the temperature of the body from the natural level to the effective hyperthermia range 
of 40 to 43°C, making them highly efficient for cancer treatment.[14,15] Hyperthermia therapy 
has been extensively explored as a secondary cancer treatment process with minimal adverse 
effects on the body while ensuring high efficacy in combating cancers via direct and indirect 
involvement.[14,19–22] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved certain iron 
oxide compositions and spherical nanostructures for the usability in many treatment 
processes.[23–26] The large-scale usage of such therapeutic technologies, due to their less 
invasive nature and minimal side effects, has further given hope in making them more effective 
and safer.[27]  The application of nanostructures in highly sensitive areas of the body such as 
the remarkably sensitive blood-brain barrier (BBB) -- a semi-permeable membrane and the 
gateway to the central nervous system -- tends to carry an imminent high risk to the life of a 
patient as particles in the nano-level possess the caliber to pass through.[28–30] Therefore, it is 
essential to exploit magnetic nanoparticles with tunable sizes for such applications.

Unlike ferro/ferri-magnetism, superparamagnetism, which generally tends to establish 
in structures less than 20 nm (with zero remanent magnetization, Mr ~ 0 and coercivity, Hc ~ 
0), is advantageous due to its easy manipulation, detectability, higher efficacy, and 
controllability, and is attractive for use in hyperthermia treatment processes, drug delivery and 
targeting, biodetection, and magnetic memory devices.[31–35] Traditionally, magnetic 
hyperthermia has primarily focused on the use of single-domain iron oxide nanoparticles with 
superparamagnetic (SPM) properties.[14,15,17,36] The use of SPM nanostructures has been further 
supported in hyperthermia treatments due to the facilitation of low agglomeration levels with 
increased dispersibility but without remanent magnetization, as the magnetization is easily 
flipped by the thermal energy, which exceeds the magnetic anisotropy energy.[37,38] However, 
due to their small size, these nanoparticles exhibit limited heating efficiency, arising from their 
low magnetization. Transitioning to larger nanoparticles with greater magnetization can 
enhance heat generation efficiency, but often leads to the emergence of ferromagnetic (FM) or 
ferrimagnetic (FiM) properties, which gives rise to magnetic clustering due to strong magnetic 
dipole interactions.[12,16] As noted above, the smaller size of nanoparticles also raises concerns 
about their ability to penetrate highly sensitive areas, which can give rise to potential issues 
related to genotoxicity and biochemical toxicity. In this context, the use of large and size-
tunable polycrystalline nanoparticles with SPM properties offers an efficient solution to 
address the existing problems of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles. 
The synergistic approach required to protect superparamagnetism while mitigating the 
risk in vulnerable areas has led us to scrutinize the structures more closely and propose a novel 
approach as illustrated in Fig. 1. Very large polycrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles, hereby 
named Superparticles (SUPAs), in the particle size range of 150 to 400 nm, can be synthesized, 
ruling out potential hazards while preserving the SPM nature owing to the 10 to 15 nm sizes of 
nanocrystals (crystallite size/grain size) within each SUPA that are smaller than the SPM size 
5 
 
limit (~20 nm).[39–41] In this study, our emphasis was on exploring the magnetic hyperthermia 
characteristics of superparamagnetic SUPAs in a medium of 2% agar since it closely replicates 
conditions found in biological environments.[42–44] This novel approach has shown the potential 
of our SUPAs for the benefit of global cancer treatment since nearly 20 million new cancer 
patients and 10 million deaths are reported annually due to cancer and cancer-related effects.[45] 
The preservation of superparamagnetism in SUPAs with particle size tunability up to 400 nm 
also highlights them as excellent candidates for many other applications including the detection 
of single particle-based cells and targeted drug delivery. 
Novel Approach to Overcoming the Superparamagnetic Particle Size Limit 
Magnetic nanostructures, ranging from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers, 
offer the capacity to tune their magnetic properties based on size, shape, crystallinity, and 
composition.[11,17,46–48]  The SPM behavior observed in FM and FiM materials implies a 
magnetization versus magnetic field response with zero coercivity (Hc) and zero remanence 
magnetization (Mr) above the blocking temperature (TB).[46] Upon size reduction, Hc varies with 
particle/grain size in a complex manner;[46,49] it increases with decreasing particle/grain size for 
multidomain magnetic systems (particle/grain size, D > Dc), reaches a maximum at a critical 
size (Dc) at which the system transforms from the multidomain (MD) state to the single domain 
(SD) state, declines to zero when particle/grain size decreases to DSPM (the SPM size limit), 
and remains zero below DSPM (Fig. 1a). In the MD regime, FM or FiM materials generally 
possess significant Hc values since grain boundaries inhibit propagation of the magnetization 
reversal or magnetic domain boundary movement, which depends on the magnetic anisotropy 
and nucleation and growth of reverse domains.[50,51] As the structure morphs into an SD from 
an MD system, the resulting SD becomes increasingly difficult to align with the applied field, 
yielding the maximum Hc at the Dc. With further decreases in particle/grain size, the thermal 
6 
 
energy becomes increasingly important in governing the spin orientation above a certain critical 
temperature.[52]

nanoparticles with size, (b) Hysteresis loop of superparamagnetic (SPM) particles with no 
coercivity (Hc = 0) and remanent magnetization (Mr = 0), (c) Hysteresis loop of 
ferro/ferrimagnetic (FM or FiM) multidomain particles with non-zero coercivity (Hc ≠ 0) and 
remanent magnetization (Mr ≠ 0), and (d) Hysteresis loop, domain states, and a 3D visualization 
of a superparticle showing SPM characteristics. 
 
This mechanism enables the structures to show SPM behavior with no coercivity and 
no remanent magnetization (Fig. 1b), as the crystallite size (dcs) of the structure falls below 
DSPM. Unlike the cases of large SD FM or FiM particles or multi-domain FM or FiM particles 
7 
 
with dcs > DSPM (Fig. 1c), we propose the creation of large polycrystalline particles composed 
of multi-nanocrystals with dcs < DSPM, securing the SPM feature but with average particle size 
well above Dc offering impassability through vital barriers (Fig. 1d). In this scenario, the 
average diameter of these SPM polycrystalline particles, reaching up to 400 nm, can far exceed 
that of the SD/MD FM or FiM particles that can span between 70 and 100 nm in diameter for 
magnetite, with variations based on their shape.[53,54]   
Results and Discussion 
Structural characterization  
The structural evaluation of SUPA samples was initially carried out using a scanning 
electron microscope (SEM) to determine general morphology and uniformity. The sizes of the 
SUPA system enabled us to categorize them at varying particle sizes up to 400 nm, as 
summarized in Table 1. The uniformity of the structures in all five samples was consistent with 
no significant morphological deviations, as shown in Fig. 2(a,b) for samples S2 and S3, 
respectively. SEM images of samples S1, S4, and S5 are presented in Fig. S1. 
Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to evaluate the 
structural integrity, interparticle adjacency, and superficial crystallite distribution (Fig. 2c-e). 
Upon closer examination through subsequent qualitative analysis, we found that the average 
crystallite size (dcs) remained consistently below 15 nm across all the structures. (see Table 1). 
The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, shown in the inset of Fig. 2(c) for sample 
S3, exhibits clear diffraction spots confirming the crystalline nature of SUPAs,[55] which 
reflects the long-range order inherent in these crystalline structures. The planes can be indexed 
back to magnetite composition, and the presence of dislocations in the structure has led to the 
streaks, and the partial rings illustrate the preferred orientations in the structures.[55] The 
structure and composition were further examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in 
Fig. 2(f), all XRD data show well-defined peaks, revealing the good crystallinity of the SUPAs. 
8 
 
The position and relative intensities of these peaks match well with those of magnetite 
structure, confirming the presence of magnetite (Fe3O4) as a major phase in all the samples 
(Fe3O4 JCPDS card number: 01-088-0315). This hypothesis has been further confirmed by X-
ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (refer to the SI, Fig. S2). All samples exhibited 
the presence of the major phase magnetite (Fe3O4) and the minor phase maghemite (γ-Fe2O3).

and specific absorption rate (SAR) of the iron oxide superparticles. SAR values were measured 
in agar (0.5 mg/mL) at an AC field of 800 Oe and a frequency of 310 kHz. 
 
 
Magnetic properties  
The magnetic properties of the SUPA samples were characterized by a Vibrating 
Sample Magnetometer (VSM) equipped within a Physical Property Measurement System 
(PPMS) from Quantum Design. The temperature dependence of the magnetization, M(T) with 
zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) curves for all samples, was measured 
sequentially over 10 K ≤ T ≤ 350 K range in the presence of a μ0H = 0.05 T applied field. Fig. 
3(a) shows the M(T) curves of a representative sample, S1. The M(T) data of the remaining 
samples are displayed in Fig. S3. It is generally understood that FC magnetization curves tend 
to flatten out when reaching lower temperatures, which indicates that the sample has kept 
magnetization constant, while upward or downward shifting of the FC magnetization curve at 
low temperatures hints at interactions between particles that become more prominent as 
thermal energy decreases.[47] Fig. 3(a) shows that as the thermal energy decreases, the 
magnetization drops since the attractions between SUPAs have made it difficult to be aligned 
with the applied magnetic field. Similar behavior was observed across other samples as well 
(refer to the SI, Fig. S3).

applied field of  0.05 T for sample S1; (b) Coercivity change with temperature for sample S1 
and sample S5 (inset). Experimental and fitted M-H curves at 300 K, with the M(H) loops at 
300 K shown in the insets, for (c) sample S1 and (d) sample S5. The fits were conducted 
utilizing the SPM model (Eq. (1)). 
We recall that a peak or maximum observed in a ZFC M(T) curve is commonly 
identified as the average blocking temperature (TB) of a nanoparticle system above which HC 
tends to approach zero with a minimal temperature-dependent change.[56]  As observed in Fig. 
3a and Fig. S4, a conspicuous cusp or peak is evident in the FC magnetization curves at TBp 
~250 K across all SUPA samples. However, it should not be simply attributed to the average 
blocking temperature of SUPAs. Instead, it likely represents the onset temperature of magnetic 
11 
 
ordering of the nanocrystals within each SUPA. Interestingly, this observation holds true 
regardless of particle size variations, ranging from 160 nm (S1) to 370 nm (S5). It is anticipated 
that all SUPA samples should manifest a SPM-like feature at T > TBp. The absence of magnetic 
hysteresis in the M(H) loops observed for all SUPA samples has indeed confirmed the SPM 
behavior at room temperature (see insets of Fig. 3c,d, and Fig. S4). A detailed analysis of the 
Hc vs. T plots for all samples, as showcased in Fig. 3b and its inset for sample S1 (D = 160 nm) 
and sample S5 (D = 370 nm), revealed a notable increase in Hc below 𝑇𝐵
𝐶 ~ 150 K, marking a 
clear transition from the SPM to FM or FiM (blocked) state. It is noteworthy that the significant 
decrease in magnetization (M) below ~150 K in the ZFC M(T) curve (Fig. 3a) correlates with 
the pronounced increase in Hc as the temperature drops below this threshold (Fig. 3b), 
suggesting the blocking of nanocrystals within each SUPA occurring below 𝑇𝐵
𝐶 ~150 K. Herein, 
𝑇𝐵
𝐶 refers to the average blocking temperature of nanocrystals encapsulated within SUPAs. Our 
findings underscore that the magnetic properties of SUPAs are primarily determined by the size 
of the nanocrystals composing each superparticle. The observation of broadened ZFC M(T) 
curves across all SUPA samples (Fig 3a and Fig. S3) is notable, likely stemming from 
competing interactions among nanocrystals within each SUPA and among different SUPAs, as 
well as from the size distributions of nanocrystals and SUPAs.  
To provide a deeper insight into the SPM behavior, we fitted the room temperature 
M(H) loops for all samples using a well-known SPM model:[57] 
𝑀(𝐻) = ∫
𝑀0𝐿(𝜇0𝑀𝑆𝑉𝐻
𝑘𝐵𝑇
)  𝑓(𝐷)
∞
0
𝑑𝐷         (1) 
where V and D are the volume and diameter of the nanocrystals, respectively; 𝑀0 is the 
saturation magnetization reached in the experimental M–H loops; 𝐿(𝑥) =  coth(𝑥) −1/𝑥 is 
the so-called Langevin Function; and MS is the theoretical saturation magnetization of 
magnetite (i.e. ~450 emu cm−3 for bulk magnetite at 300 K).[58] The function f(D) corresponds 
12 
 
to the particle size distribution; in our case, we have assumed a log-normal size distribution, 
typical for nanoparticles, as shown below: 
                                            𝑓(𝐷) =
1
𝐷𝛽√2𝜋∙exp (−
(ln𝐷−ln𝛼)2
2𝛽2
)          (2)                                
where  𝛼 and 𝛽 are fitting parameters, and the other fitting parameter is 𝑀0. From the fittings, 
we can estimate the average "magnetic diameter" 𝐷 and standard deviation 𝜎 of the 
nanoparticles: 
𝐷= 𝛼exp (𝛽2
2),         𝜎2 = 𝐷
2 (𝐷
2
𝛼2 −1)               (3)         
⁄
 
A good fit was obtained for all SUPA samples, as showcased in Figs. 3c and 3d for samples S1 
and S5, respectively. The fitting results for other samples are also included in the SI (Fig. S5). 
The estimated average size and standard deviation are 𝐷 = 9.4 nm and 𝜎 = 0.1 nm for S1, and 
𝐷 = 9.3 nm and 𝜎 = 0.9 nm for S5, respectively. These values are close to the ones obtained by 
TEM for the crystallites (see Table 1), confirming that at 300 K these nanocrystallites are the 
ones dominating the SPM-like behavior of the SUPAs. These findings are in agreement with 
our aforementioned interpretation of the ZFC-FC M(T) curves. It is noteworthy that through 
the careful control of crystallite size to remain below the SPM threshold (dcs < SSPM), we have 
successfully engineered superparamagnetic SUPAs, offering the capability to tune particle 
sizes up to 400 nm. In other words, the SPM characteristics of SUPAs are primarily influenced 
by the size of the nanocrystals within each individual SUPA, rather than the size of the SUPA 
itself. While tuning the particle size between 160 and 400 nm, consistent values of Ms were 
maintained across all SUPA samples (refer to Table 1). These consistent characteristics hold 
significant promise for diverse biomedical applications. We note further that the optimum 
crystallite size range for maintaining superparamagnetic properties while preserving high 
saturation magnetization is 10 to 15 nm. Crystallite sizes below 10 nm retain 
13 
 
superparamagnetism but have reduced magnetization capability,[59] while sizes above 15 nm 
might exhibit ferromagnetic behavior.[12]  
Magnetic hyperthermia properties  
To explore the potential of superparamagnetic SUPAs for biomedical applications, we 
tested their magnetic hyperthermia responses. The heating efficiency of the SUPAs was 
evaluated in both water and 2% weight agar solution at 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, which are 
comparatively lower concentration levels compared to those reported previously.[60–62] The agar 
solution restricted the physical movement of SUPAs, mimicking cell environments such as cell 
cytoplasm and extracellular matrix.[63,64] Fig. 4 displays the heating curves for all samples at 
concentrations of 1 mg/mL,  and 0.5 mg/mL, subjected to AC fields of 600 Oe and 800 Oe at 
a constant frequency of 310 kHz. The data show that all the samples yielded consistent results, 
with sample S1 showing significantly higher heating capability across all concentrations. 
Notably, the heating capabilities of the samples for the hyperthermia treatment process were 
evaluated for a maximum of 15 minutes (900 s), which is lower than the typical treatment 
duration of 30 minutes to 1 hour.[65,66] The natural cooling observed after the removal of HAC 
indicated satisfactory retention of heat, which is a promising feature.

concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL in the presence of 600 Oe and 800 Oe AC fields at 
a constant frequency of 310 kHz. 
 
To quantify the heating efficiency of the samples, the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), 
which is a measure of the absorption energy, usually determined from the initial rate of 
temperature rise, was evaluated.[67] In our computations utilizing Eq. (4), we derived the SAR 
values from the heating curves after a 60-second interval, as the SUPAs tend to stabilize over 
time: 
                                                                𝑆𝐴𝑅=

Here the T/t represents the change in temperature with time, and CP represents the 
heat capacity of the liquid solvent (in this case, water with 4.186 J/g∙K). The symbol φ 
represents a unitless quantity: mass of magnetic material per unit mass of liquid solvent.  
 
Figure 5: (a) SAR values of all SUPA samples in 2% agar at 0.5 mg/mL concentration in the 
presence of 400, 600, and 800 Oe AC fields, and (b) SAR values of all the samples in 2% agar 
at concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mg/mL in an 800 Oe AC field.  
Figure 5a shows the SAR values for all the samples at 0.5 mg/mL concentration in 2% 
agar of which the HAC of 800 Oe showed the highest SAR values, with S1 at 286 W/g obtained 
using initial slope/time-rise protocol assuming a minimal to no heat gain/loss.[68] The SUPAs 
were initially evaluated with de-ionized water (refer to the SI, Fig. S6) which led to temperature 
drops with the HAC. These drops could be related to the movement or rearrangement of the 
SUPAs upon application of the AC field in water. Due to inconsistencies with the temperature 
drops, the heating responses of SUPAs in water were not considered for the SAR calculations. 
Similar to the peculiar observation related to water, the concentration increments that usually 
lead to higher SAR values were not observed in SUPAs but rather a drop, which might be due 
to intensified interparticle interactions with the increased presence of SUPAs per unit volume, 
as shown in Fig. 5b. Moreover, we conducted comprehensive field-dependent and 
16 
 
concentration-dependent measurements, which served to deepen our aforementioned 
observations (refer to the SI, Fig. S7). 
 
Figure 6: (a-c) Dynamic hysteresis loops measured at various frequencies and (d-f) the 
corresponding SAR vs. field curves for sample S5 at a concentration of 1.4 mg/mL.  
To validate the SAR values mentioned above, we employed an additional independent 
method. This approach enabled us to directly measure the AC magnetic hysteresis loops and 
calculate the SAR values based on the area (A) enclosed by these loops, according to the 
following equation:[69] 
𝑆𝐴𝑅 (
𝑊
𝑔) =
𝑓
𝑐∙𝐴=
𝑓
𝑐∙∮𝜇0𝑀𝑡𝑑𝐻𝑡                       (5) 
with Mt being the instantaneous magnetization at time t, Ht the sinusoidal magnetic field of 
frequency f at time t, and c the magnetite weight concentration in the dispersing medium.  The 
integration was conducted over a period of the oscillating magnetic field, T = 2π/f. AC magnetic 
hysteresis measurements were performed at various frequencies (f = 132, 300, and 638 kHz) 
on sample S5 possessing the largest average particle size of ~370 nm. The results obtained are 
displayed in Fig. 6. As illustrated, narrow minor loops were consistently obtained at low AC 
17 
 
fields across all applied frequencies (Fig. 6a-c). However, with increasing AC field strength, 
both the area of the AC loops (Fig. 6a-c) and the corresponding SAR values (Fig. 6d-f) 
gradually increased. Notably, at 300 kHz and 800 Oe, a SAR value of approximately 150 W/g 
was achieved, aligning closely with the value previously estimated from calorimetric 
measurements (Fig. 5b).[70] It is also noteworthy from Fig. 6f that SAR reached 600 W/g as 
the frequency rose to 632 kHz, indicating the potential of SUPAs for magnetic hyperthermia 
therapy. 
Finally, we compared the SAR values for our SUPAs with those obtained from other 
nanostructures (spheres, cubes, rods), highlighting their superior SPM characteristics and lower 
concentration requirements (refer to the SI, Table S1). This comparison underscores the 
absence of SPM behavior in typical nanostructures as particle size increases. Notably, 
conventionally synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles with average sizes of 40 nm or larger 
exhibit ferrimagnetic (FiM) behavior, contrasting with our SUPAs, which maintain SPM 
characteristics despite sizes up to 400 nm. It is also noteworthy that only half the concentration 
of SUPAs (0.5 mg/mL vs. 1 mg/mL) is required for magnetic hyperthermia treatment compared 
to other candidates (Table S1). The combination of SPM properties, large and adjustable SARs, 
and reduced concentration requirements positions these iron oxide superparticles as compelling 
contenders for a wide range of biomedical applications. 
Conclusions 
Polycrystalline iron oxide superparticles of particle sizes up to 400 nm, featuring 
crystallite sizes of 10-15 nm, exhibit superparamagnetic features at room temperature. We have 
demonstrated that if crystallite sizes are alike and below the SPM size threshold, SUPAs display 
SPM behavior at room temperature and enter a FM or FiM (blocked) state at a comparable 
temperature. Across all samples, a low concentration of 0.5 mg/mL consistently yielded a SAR 
18 
 
exceeding 250 W/g at an 800 Oe AC field. The exceptional stability of superparamagnetic 
SUPAs in a 2% by-weight agar solution, at both 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL concentrations, 
underscores their potential for in vivo studies. However, further evaluations of the cytotoxicity 
and biocompatibility of these superparticles are needed, even though the composition and 
structures conform with internationally accredited safety agencies such as the FDA. The 
promising performance of these superparamagnetic superparticles warrants further exploration 
to deepen our understanding of the underlying physics behind their mechanisms. 
Experimental Methods 
Materials. The chemicals used for synthesis of polycrystalline superparamagnetic 
nanoparticles were iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (97%, Alfa Aesar), ethylene glycol (99%, 
Sigma Aldrich), diethylene glycol (99%, ACROS Organics), sodium acetate anhydrous (99%, 
ACROS Organics), sodium acetate trihydrate (99%, Fisher), sodium acrylate (97%, Sigma 
Aldrich), and polyethylene glycol (400) (Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation). A 65-mL 
volume pressure vessel was purchased from Chem Glass. In addition, common solvents such 
as deionized water with a resistance of 18 MΩ-cm (Academic Milli-Q Water System, Millipore 
Corporation), ethanol (200 proof, Decon Labs), and acetone (99%, Oakwood) were used.  
Synthesis of iron oxide superparticles. The polycrystalline superparamagnetic 
nanoparticles were synthesized by solvothermal methods in a binary solvent system containing 
ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, with modifications in the technical set-up and the uses 
of chemical additives.[12,71–73] In this method, the use of anhydrous sodium acetate (2.17 or 3.6 
g) in the synthesis was found to be effective in maintaining the small crystallite size (the size 
of the primary crystal) at the range from 10 to 15 nm while allowing for the fabrication of large 
particles with diameters larger than 160 nm.[74] Initially, a pressure vessel was charged with 
1.35 g of FeCl3·6H2O and 20 mL of the binary solvent mixture (see below). After the complete 
dissolution of the iron chloride, an additional 20 mL of the binary solvent was added to 
19 
 
anhydrous sodium acetate. The binary solvent system used for the synthesis consisted of 15/25 
mL or 20/20 mL of ethylene glycol/diethylene glycol. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes 
to ensure complete dissolution, followed by the addition of 1.2 mL of PEG (400) surfactant. 
The Teflon cap was securely fastened, and the pressure vessel was heated to 188 °C for 
refluxing over 5 hours. A safety shield was used to cover the synthesis setup. After synthesis, 
the product was cooled to room temperature and washed with ethanol combined with magnetic 
separation for at least 3 cycles. It is important to note that technical parameters such as stirring 
speed or slower heating rate can be used to alter the size of nanoparticles. Particularly, a faster 
stirring speed or slower ramping rate can increase the average size of nanoparticles. By 
adjusting the technical parameters, varying the solvent composition, and utilizing different 
amounts of sodium acetate additives, the size of polycrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles can 
be tuned from 160 to 400 nm.[74]  
Characterizations. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) FEI Dual Beam 235 Focused 
Ion Beam at operating voltage 15 kV was used for imaging the nanoparticles. Samples were 
dissolved in ethanol and drop-cast onto a clean silicon wafer. Transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) JEOL JEM-2010 was used with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Samples were 
prepared on TEM grids 300-mesh holey carbon-coated copper grids (TED Pella). X-ray 
diffraction data (Smart Lab, Rigaku) were collected using Cu Kα irradiation operated at 40 kV 
and 44 mA with a 0.01° step size was used for all samples. The crystallite size was calculated 
by the Scherrer formula from the diffracted peak of the (311) plane at 2θ of 35.5°. X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on a dried sample drop-cast onto a 
silicon wafer using a PHI 5700 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα 
X-rays. Calibration was performed using the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.  
The magnetic measurements were performed using a Physical Property Measurement 
System (PPMS) by Quantum Design, Inc., utilizing the vibrating sample magnetometer option 
20 
 
between 10-350 K at a maximum applied magnetic field of 2 T. Calorimetric magnetic 
hyperthermia experiments were carried out using a 4.2 kW Ambrell Easyheat Li3542 
equipment with varying AC magnetic fields (0-800 Oe) at a constant 310 kHz frequency 
starting at 20 0C for 900 seconds with 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL nanoparticles in a 2% by weight 
agar solution prepared with deionized water. AC magnetometry measurements were carried out 
using a homemade setup to record the AC hysteresis loops.[75] The AC magnetic field amplitude 
was tuned between 0 and 80 mT, and 3 different frequencies were employed, 149 kHz, 300, 
and 638 kHz. Samples were again prepared in a 2% agar solution.
