Tuning cell rearrangements is essential in collective cell movement that underlies cancer progres-
sion, wound repair, and embryonic development. A key question is how tissue material properties
and morphology emerge from cellular factors such as cell-cell adhesion.
Here, we introduce a two-
dimensional active force-based model of tissue monolayers that captures the liquid-to-solid transition
exhibited by tissues. Unlike the Vertex and Voronoi models, our model shows that reducing inter-
cellular adhesion in near-confluent tissues leads to spontaneous neighbor exchanges and fluidization.
Near the liquid-solid phase boundary, we also found glassy behavior characterized by subdiffusive
dynamics, swirling cell motion, and non-Gaussian exponential tails in displacement distributions.
These exponential tails collapse onto a single master curve, suggesting a universal ’diffusion length’
in the glassy regime. Notably, we demonstrate that structural parameters based on cell shape cannot
always distinguish tissue phases due to huge cell shape fluctuations that are not observed in Vertex
and Voronoi models. Our general simulation framework streamlines previous approaches by remov-
ing many arbitrary features and can reproduce known model behaviors under different conditions,
offering potential applications in developmental biology and physiology.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Tissue fluidity is modulated in diverse biological con-
texts such as embryonic development [1, 2], wound heal-
ing [3, 4], and cancer progression [5, 6]. A solid-to-fluid
transition can sculpt tissues during tail elongation in de-
veloping zebrafish embryos [1, 2, 7]. This phase transition
also coincides with the cell-state switching and changes in
gene expressions, called Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal tran-
sition (EMT) [1, 8]. EMT has been proposed to mimic
an unjamming transition in tissues [9–11].
Fluid-solid
transitions were also observed in cell monolayers [12, 13],
where transitions occur either with increasing cell density
(due to proliferation) [13] or with increasing cellular ad-
hesion [12]. Tissue monolayers further undergo solid-to-
fluid transitions by applying external compressive stress
[10, 11]. How tissue-level transitions emerge from gov-
erning cellular parameters is an important question yet
to be fully understood [9, 14, 15].
Two classes of computational frameworks mainly exist
to explain tissue-level transitions: Self-propelled particle
(SPP) models and models that treat cells as extended ob-
jects. SPP models describe cells as soft discs [16–18] and
have been used to study the density (or packing fraction)
dependent [19–23] and motility-driven [12, 19, 20, 23]
jamming transitions. However, SPP models can not cap-
ture the cell shape changes in a confluent tissue where
there are almost no gaps between cells (i.e., packing frac-
tion close to unity). Meanwhile, the Vertex model and
its variants [24–31], Self-propelled Voronoi model [32–
34], Deformable Particle model [35], Cellular Potts model
[36–38], and Phase Field model [39] describe cells as ex-

tended objects accounting for the cell geometry. Cell dy-
namics in all these models depend on energy functions,
unlike SPP models that describe the force-based motion
of cell centers. For instance, 2D Vertex and Self-propelled
Voronoi (SPV) models define a shape-energy function
that depends on each cell’s target area (a0) and perimeter
(p0). These models predict a density-independent solid-
to-fluid transition with an increasing target shape index,
s0, defined as a dimensionless parameter (s0 = p0/√a0).
However, the increase in shape index was interpreted as
an increase in cell-cell adhesion [26, 32]. This counter-
intuitively implies that increasing adhesion drives tissue
fluidization.
In contrast, increasing cell-cell adhesion induces solid-
ification in MDCK cell monolayers [12, 40] and organ-
otypic cultures [41]. Also, the downregulation of adhe-
sion molecules in the elongating zebrafish tail coincides
with EMT and tissue fluidization [1, 8]. Thus, the role
of intercellular adhesion on the tissue scale transitions is
still debatable. We address this by introducing a 2D ac-
tive force-based model of tissue monolayers, where each
cell made with beads and springs represents a soft de-
formable object.
We combine the particle-like nature and force-based
dynamics of SPP models with the spatial extension of
cells as in Vertex and SPV models, eliminating the defi-
ciencies of both types of models. For instance, our model
displays spontaneous neighbor exchanges, while Vertex
and SPV models implement these events in an ad hoc
manner, using a threshold value on cellular edge lengths.
Additionally, the interface of adjoining cells in Vertex and
SPV models is represented by a shared (common) edge,
making it impossible for adjoining cells to move relative
to one another, thereby dictating a geometric constraint
[42]. Our model removes this unphysical constraint, al-
lowing for spontaneous fluctuations in cell shapes. No-
tably, our model significantly differs from topological

energy-based models, like the Vertex and Voronoi mod-
els, where a single cell loses its physical meaning in iso-
lation (see Section III in SI).
In our model, increasing cell-cell adhesion leads to
liquid-to-solid transition, contrary to the predictions of
Vertex and Voronoi models. Our observation is consis-
tent with in vitro experiments on tissues [12, 41] and in
vivo experiments on morphogenesis during embryonic de-
velopment [1, 8]. Near the liquid-solid phase boundary,
we also observe glassy dynamics with many signatures
of dynamic heterogeneity. In the glassy regime, we col-
lapse distinct exponential tails of displacement distribu-
tions onto a master curve, revealing a universal ‘diffusion
length’ that explains the origin of dynamic heterogeneity.
Our framework provides precise control over individual
cell properties and cell-cell interaction to gain mechanis-
tic insights into emerging tissue behavior, with potential
applications in various developmental and physiological
contexts.

MODEL
We adopted a force-based passive mechanical model of
2D soft grains (or cells) [43–45] instead of commonly used
frameworks of energy-based Vertex or Voronoi models. A
single cell is assumed to be a closed loop of beads con-
nected by springs with stiffness Ks and natural length l0
(Fig. 1A(top), Fig. S1). Each bead encounters tangential
tension from adjacent springs and internal pressure, P.
These intracellular forces capture the roles of actomyosin
cortex and cytoplasmic pressure, respectively. Thus, the
total intracellular force experienced by the i-th bead in
a cell is:
F intra
i
= Ks(li −l0)ˆti −Ks(li+1 −l0)ˆti+1 + Pl0
2 (ˆni + ˆni+1).
(1)
Here li is the bond length between i-th and (i −1)-
th beads; while ˆti and ˆni denote the tangential and
the outward normal unit vectors corresponding to the
i-th bead, respectively (Fig. S1).
Moreover, beads of
distinct cells experience short-ranged intercellular forces
consisting of two parts:
a spring-like attraction, de-
scribing the cell-cell adhesion, and a spring-like re-
pulsion, preventing cell interpenetration.
Thus, in-
tercellular forces on the i-th bead of one cell due to
the interaction with the j-th bead of another cell are
F inter
ij
= Kadh(rc
adh −rij)ˆrij , if rc
rep ≤rij ≤rc
adh
= −Krep(rc
rep −rij)ˆrij , if rij < rc
rep
= 0
,
otherwise.
(2)
The distance between two interacting beads is rij =
|ri,α −rj,β|, and the corresponding unit vector is ˆrij =
(ri,α−rj,β)/rij, where i-th and j-th beads belong to α-th
and β-th cell, respectively. Adhesive and repulsive forces
are characterized by corresponding strengths (Kadh and
Krep respectively) and cut-off ranges (rcadh and rcrep).
Additionally, we incorporate a polarity vector ˆpα =
(cos θα, sin θα),
in which direction each bead of α-
th cell exerts a self-generated motility force of mag-
nitude
cv0
(where
c
is
the
coefficient
of
viscous
drag
and
v0
is
the
self-propulsion
speed).
All
beads in each cell possess the same motility direc-
tion (Fig. 1A(bottom)), but it differs from cell to cell.
Together, the equation of motion governing the over-
damped dynamics of the i-th bead of α-th cell becomes
c ˙ri,α = F intra
i,α
+
X
j
F inter
ij,α
+ cv0ˆpα.
(3)
Here, j-th bead belongs to another cell, interacting
with the α-th cell. The unit polarity vector for the α-
th cell further undergoes a rotational diffusion given by
∂θα
∂t = ζα(t) ;
⟨ζα(t)ζβ(t′)⟩= 2Drδ(t −t′)δαβ.
(4)
Here, the angle θα defines ˆpα, and ζα(t) is a Gaus-
sian white noise with zero mean and variance 2Dr. We
nondimensionalized the model by choosing the units of
length and time as l0 and c/Ks, respectively.
Thus,
four dimensionless parameters mainly determine the col-
lective dynamics: non-dimensional intracellular pressure
( ˜P = P/Ks), adhesion strength ( ˜Kadh = Kadh/Ks), self-
propulsion speed (˜v0 = cv0/Ksl0), and rotational noise
strength ( ˜Dr = Drc/Ks). We used the model to simulate
a nearly confluent tissue with 256 cells, each consisting
of 50 beads. Starting with random cell centers, the tissue
monolayer was simulated using Euler’s method up to 107
iterations with a time step 10−3, under periodic bound-
ary conditions (see SI for simulation details and Table S1
for parameter values).

RESULTS
We first explored how the cell shapes and tissue state
qualitatively change with the variations of cell-cell ad-
hesion ( ˜Kadh) and rotational noise strength ( ˜Dr) (see
Fig. 1B). When ˜Kadh and ˜Dr are low, cells are mostly
elliptical and rounded shaped with noticeable intercel-
lular gaps (Fig. 1B, bottom-left). With an increase in
˜Kadh or ˜Dr, regular polygonal cell shapes (like hexagons
and pentagons) coexist with rounded shapes, along with
some intercellular gaps in the tissue (Fig. 1B, top-left and
bottom-right). In contrast, when both ˜Kadh and ˜Dr are
high, almost all cells become regular hexagonal-shaped
with virtually no cell-cell gaps (Fig. 1B, top-right), sug-
gesting cell jamming.
To characterize the above phenomenon, we first evalu-
ated the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of cell cen-
ter trajectories, defined as ⟨∆r 2(∆t)⟩= ⟨[r cm
α (t0 +∆t)−
r cm
α (t0)]2⟩. Here, r cm
α (t) is the position vector of the α-th
cell center at time t, t0 is a reference time, ∆t is the lag
time, and the angular brackets denote the average over
all cells and over different ensembles.
We found that
the cell motion is diffusive for low ˜Kadh (see Fig. 2A).
However, with the increasing ˜Kadh, the motion becomes
subdiffusive, and eventually, the MSD plateaus at large
times, indicating the arrested motion of cells caged by
their neighbors. Thus, the monolayer transforms from
a fluid to a solid regime with increasing adhesion (when
other parameters are fixed). The monolayer also gets so-
lidified with increasing ˜P or ˜Dr, and decreasing ˜v0 (Fig.
S3).
We further observed that cells spontaneously exchange
their neighbors (known as T1 transition [46]) in the
fluid phase (see Movie S1 and Fig. 2B). Correspond-
ingly, the cell center trajectories appear diffusive in na-
ture (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the trajectories look caged
in the solid phase, as expected from the MSD curves
(Fig. 2A). We then computed an effective diffusivity from
the long-time MSD behavior [32], defined by Deff =
limt→∞⟨∆r 2(∆t)⟩/4D0∆t, where D0 = v02/2Dr can be
regarded as the self-diffusivity for an isolated single cell
[32]. The order parameter, Deff, showed a transition with
increasing intercellular adhesion (Fig. 2D). We also mea-
sured the MSD exponents (β) by fitting the MSD curves
at large times with the function: ⟨∆r 2(∆t)⟩∼∆tβ. The
MSD exponent was 1 for the fluid regime and showed a
sharp drop as the tissue solidified (Fig. 2E).
Next, we explored the phase space spanned by the
three dimensionless parameters, the intercellular adhe-
sion ( ˜Kadh), the intracellular pressure ( ˜P), and the ro-
tational noise strength ( ˜Dr). We determined the phase
diagrams in the 2D parameter space by varying two of
the above parameters (Fig. 3A-C). We identified the fluid
phase by the cut-off Deff > 0.001 and solid by Deff ≤
0.001 (cut-off values were chosen following Fig. 2D). Here,
we determined the phase diagrams by keeping the cell
motility (˜v0) fixed, though the phase planes can also be

constructed by varying ˜v0 (Fig. S4). The 2D phase planes
can be combined to visualize a schematic 3D phase di-
agram (Fig. 3D). Similar to the SPV model prediction
[32], Fig. 3D shows that the monolayer gets fludized with
increasing persistence time scale for the rotational noise
(given by 1/ ˜Dr). But, concerning the effect of cell-cell
adhesion ( ˜Kadh), our phase diagram fundamentally dif-
fers from Vertex and SPV models [32, 47], where adhe-
sion helps fluidization in a confluent tissue. However, our
prediction agrees with the speculated jamming phase di-
agrams derived from previous experiments [9, 41], which
hypothesized that intercellular adhesion solidifies the tis-
sue. In addition, our phase diagram crucially points out
that solidification can occur with increasing intracellu-
lar pressure, consistent with the observation that high
cytoplasmic pressure promotes epithelial integrity [48].
Since cells can modulate cortical tension during mor-
phogenesis [49], we calculated the tension in cell-edges,
defined as Ti = |li −l0| (ignoring the multiplicative con-
stant), where li is the distance between i-th and (i−1)-th
beads in a cell and l0 is the natural spring length. Deep in
the fluid phase, the tension is highly heterogeneous over
the tissue (Fig. 4A), while it is homogeneous in the solid

phase (Fig. 4B). We also calculated the average tension
in the steady state (given by T = (P
M,N Ti)/MN, where
M and N are the bead and cell numbers, respectively),
and found that it is lower and display higher fluctua-
tions in the fluid phase than the solid phase (Fig. 4C,
Fig. S5). Thus, tension fluctuations decrease with the
solidification, as recently shown in the ‘Dynamic Vertex
Model’ (DVM) with active tension dynamics [7].
However, tension fluctuation is an emerging property
of our model, while in DMV, tension fluctuation was in-
troduced via a dynamical equation for the edge tension.
We also measured the area fraction (ϕ) over time, de-
fined as ϕ = (PN
α=1 Aα)/L2, where Aα is the area of
the α-th cell and L is the simulation box length. The
area fraction substantially fluctuates in the fluid phase
compared to the solid phase (Fig. 4D), although it in-
creases marginally (from 0.83 to 0.87) from the fluid to
solid phase (Fig. 4D). Thus, the tissue remains near con-
fluent throughout the transition, similar to the measured
in vivo volume fraction (around 80% −90%) in dense ze-
brafish tissues [1]. We next computed the cell shape in-
dex, S = (PN
α=1 Sα)/N = (PN
α=1 Pα/√Aα)/N, Pα and
Aα being the perimeter and area of the α-th cell, respec-
tively [26, 32]. Note that this shape index can be mea-
sured as an emerging property [7, 10, 26, 32, 37], while
the ‘target shape index’ is a tunable parameter defined in
the energy function of Vertex and Voronoi (SPV) mod-
els [26, 32]. We observed that the shape index fluctuates
wildly over time in the fluid phase, but its fluctuations
diminish in the solid phase (Fig. 4E).
The Vertex and SPV models [26, 32] showed that the
average shape index, ⟨S⟩, serves as a structural order
parameter.
In DVM and SPV models [7, 32], ⟨S⟩in-
creases monotonically as the tissue fluidizes. In contrast,
our model reveals that ⟨S⟩behaves non-monotonically
with adhesion near the fluid-solid transition, especially
for lower ˜Dr (Fig. 4F). Moreover, the dynamical order
parameter, Deff, is also non-monotonic with ⟨S⟩(Fig. 4F
inset), indicating that both fluid and solid phases can
possess the same ⟨S⟩value close to the transition. Thus,
the shape index alone cannot distinguish between the tis-
sue phases. We then examined how the shape index fluc-
tuates across the transition, as marked by (i), (ii), and
(iii) in Fig. 4F (denoting three distinct regions: deep
in the fluid phase, near the phase boundary, and the
solid phase, respectively). The standard deviation of S
(σS =
p
⟨S2⟩−⟨S⟩2) displayed a peak near the transi-
tion boundary in region-ii (Fig. 4G). Corresponding tis-
sue configurations are shown in Fig. 4H, and the distribu-
tions of the shape index (P(S)) are plotted in Fig. 4I. At
region-ii, where σS has a peak, the distribution P(S) be-
comes more skewed and broader than other regimes (see
Fig. 4I). Interestingly, elongated polygonal and rounded
cell shapes coexist in region-ii (Fig. 4H(ii)), whereas cell
shapes are mostly rounded in region-i and polygonal (i.e.,
pentagonal or hexagonal) in region-iii (Fig. 4H). More-
over, in the solid regime (region-iii), the monolayer re-
sembles a tightly packed foam, where the normalized cell
area follows a generalized k-gamma distribution as found
earlier in granular material [50], foam [51], and the Ver-
tex model [52] (see Fig. S6).
The cell shape heterogeneity that arises near the tran-
sition (Fig. 4G, H) may be linked with underlying dy-
namic heterogeneity in cell motion.
To examine this,
within a time window (t1 to t2), we measured the to-
tal normalized distance covered by individual cell cen-
ters, ¯dα, defined for the α-th cell as ¯dα = dα/(PM
α=1 dα),
where dα = Pt2−∆t
ti=t1 ∆rα(ti) = Pt2−∆t
ti=t1 |r cm
α (ti + ∆t) −
r cm
α (ti)|. As suggested by the heatmaps of Fig. 4J, dif-
ferent mobilities exist in region-i but in a spatially ran-
dom fashion (Fig. 4J(i)).
However, cells in region-iii
mostly have lower mobilities (Fig. 4J(iii)). Significantly,
in region-ii, fast-moving and slow-moving cells form clus-
ters (Fig. 4J(ii)), suggesting that cells with distinct mo-
bilities coexist with spatial correlation.
This indicates
that cells are dynamically heterogeneous, suggesting a
glass transition, as found in colloidal glasses [53, 54] and
in dense bacterial biofilm [55].
To probe the glassy versus fluidic behavior, we plotted
the vector field of cell center displacements for region-i
and region-ii, corresponding to lower and higher adhesion
strengths, respectively (see Fig. 5A, B). The displace-
ment vectors are random for region-i but exhibit swirling
patterns indicating spatial correlations in region-ii. Also,
large and small displacements coexist in the vector field
of region-ii, suggesting dynamic heterogeneity similar to
polycrystalline materials and glasses [53, 56–58].

shapes, suggesting shape fluctuations. In I(ii), the shape index distribution is much broader than the other regions (I(i) &
I(ii)). (J) Each cell is color mapped with the amount of distance it traversed within a time window (from 2 × 105 to 2 × 106
iterations) in the three specified regions, (i), (ii), and (iii) of Panel G. In J(ii), cells with large and small displacements coexist
together, forming connected clusters. Parameters: ˜Kadh = 8.3 × 10−4 for region-i, ˜Kadh = 0.25 for region-ii, and ˜Kadh = 0.46
for region-iii. Other parameters are from Fig. 3 and Table S1.
tably, similar swirling displacement fields were observed
in previous models [32, 59, 60] and epithelial monolayers
[3, 12, 13, 61].
Another quantity that can capture the glassy behav-
ior is the non-Gaussian parameter defined by α2(∆t) =
⟨∆r 4(∆t)⟩/(2⟨∆r 2(∆t)⟩
2) −1. It is non-zero if displace-
ment distributions deviate from Gaussian [37, 57].
In
Fig. 5C, α2 is almost zero in region-i (lower adhesion),
for which diffusive cell dynamics is expected.
In con-
trast, α2 has a sharp non-zero peak at the lag time ∆t∗
in region-ii (higher adhesion), for which cell dynamics
is subdiffusive. Accordingly, the displacement distribu-
tion P(∆), measured at ∆t∗, is Gaussian in region-i, but
it develops broad exponential tails in region-ii (Fig. 5D,
5E). Such non-zero peaks in α2 and corresponding non-
Gaussian tails in displacement distributions have been
observed in inanimate glassy materials [53, 57, 58], and
also in living systems like embryonic tissues [62] and cy-
toskeletal dynamics in human muscle cells [63].
The broad exponential tail in the displacement distri-
bution (Fig. 5E) represents the motile cells performing
random jumps between cages [53, 57, 63]. The lag time
∆t∗, at which α2 shows a peak (Fig. 5C), gives the cage
breaking time scale [53, 57, 58]. Indeed, within a time
window spanning ∆t∗, a sample trajectory in region-ii
displays rare and quick hopping of a cell between cages
formed by its neighbors (Fig. 5F(ii)), but the trajectory
looks simply diffusive in region-i (Fig. 5F(i)).
However, what could be the physical origin of the ex-
ponential tails in displacement distributions observed in
the glassy regime (region-ii)?
We found that the in-
dividual diffusion coefficients (D), measured from the

Dynamic heterogeneity and glassy dynamics. (A-B) Cell center displacements over a time window (from

4G). For lower adhesion (region-i, A), instantaneous displacements are random and uncorrelated, whereas the displacement
field shows swirling patterns for higher adhesion (region-ii, B). (C) The non-Gaussian parameter, α2(∆t), shows a peak for

an exponential fit. (F) Sample cell center trajectories within a time window (corresponding to the shaded region in C). The

Insets of H and I show zoomed tail parts of corresponding distributions. The parameters are the same as in Fig. 4.
time-averaged MSD curves, have a broad skewed dis-
tribution that has an exponential-like form (Fig. 5G).
Thus, the exponential tails in displacement distribu-
tions (Fig. 5H) can stem from the cell-to-cell hetero-
geneity in individual diffusivities [64, 65]. Suppose in-
dividual cells in the ensemble follow independent diffu-
sive dynamics characterized by Gaussian displacement
distributions but with an exponentially distributed dif-
fusion coefficient, D.
Then, non-gaussian displace-
ments can be achieved as the convolution of Gaus-
sian — We can write the displacement distribution (at
a lag time ∆t∗) as:
P(∆x) =
R
p(D) g(∆x|D) dD,
where, g(∆x|D) = (1/

¯D
= (PN

the form:
P(∆x) = (1/2
√¯D∆t∗) exp(∆x/
√¯D∆t∗) ∼
exp(−∆x/
√¯D∆t∗). Further, note that we numerically
obtained individual diffusion coefficients by the defini-
tion D = limt→∞⟨∆r 2(∆t)⟩/4∆t for the 2-dimensional
dynamics. Thus, for the 1D component of displacements
(∆x or ∆y), we take the mean diffusivity to be 2 ¯D to
consider the dimensionality. Therefore, if we consider the
scaled 1D displacement ˜∆= ∆/
√
2 ¯D∆t∗, the distribu-
tion P( ˜∆) then follows an exponential distribution with
exponent 1. Indeed, for various values of ˜Kadh and ˜Dr,
different non-Gaussian exponential tails with distinct ex-
ponents collapse onto a single master curve (∼exp(−| ˜∆|)
when the scaled displacement ( ˜∆) is used (see Fig. 5H,
I). Thus,
√
2 ¯D∆t∗represents a mean diffusion length by
which displacements can be normalized to obtain a uni-
versal form, elucidating the link between exponential tails
and the heterogeneous diffusivities of individual cells.

DISCUSSION
Summary and relevance: Our result of tissue solid-
ification with adhesion, though contrasts the prediction
of Vertex and Voronoi models [26, 32], are in line with in
vitro experiments [12, 40, 41]. This also explains how the
downregulation of adhesion molecules leads to in vivo tis-
sue fluidization during zebrafish tail development [1, 8].
Similar to the experiment [1], adhesion-induced solidifi-
7
cation accompanies a marginal change in packing fraction
in our model. We also found tissue fluidization with in-
creasing self-propulsion speed that captures a recent ex-
periment on motility-driven unjamming in gastrulation
[2]. We further show that the average shape index alone
cannot be used as a structural order parameter to distin-
guish the phases due to large shape fluctuations near the
transition point. Also, increased adhesion results in dy-
namic heterogeneity and glassy behavior near the phase
boundary.
Our force-based framework, which is conceptually
straightforward to implement, relies on a free energy
function that obeys the Young-Laplace equation at the
level of a single cell in equilibrium (see Section III, SI) —
this is distinct from the topological energy functions used
in Vertex, Voronoi, and Cellular Potts models [26, 32, 37].
Contrasting these models, we do not assume any tar-
get shape parameters since there is no experimental sup-
port and such parameters are difficult to physically inter-
pret. Our model exhibits spontaneous neighbor exchange
(T1 transitions) unlike the Vertex/Voronoi frameworks,
where T1 transitions are performed using an ad hoc cri-
terion of a threshold value on cellular edge lengths [7, 26].
Further, intercellular gaps naturally arise in our model,
unlike the Voronoi tesselation framework, where cell-cell
gaps are either completely absent [26, 32] or implemented
by assuming extra ‘non-physical’ vertices [7]. We also ob-
serve the spontaneous formation of multicellular rosettes
(where five or more cells share a vertex) [66] (Fig. S7).
In contrast, rosettes were formed in Vertex models by
implementing an ad hoc ‘edge collapse’ procedure that
randomly reduces edge lengths to zero [30].
Connection with other models:
To compare with
the jamming in passive foams, we studied our model
without the self-propulsion and adhesion (v0 = 0, Kadh =
0). In a rigid box, we produced jammed states by inflat-
ing the cells with increasing pressure (i.e., with increasing
packing fraction). We show that the tissue becomes con-
fluent when the normalized area fraction reaches unity
(ϕ/ϕmax = 1) at an average shape index ⟨S⟩≈3.81
(see Fig. S8 and Section V, SI). This is similar to the
crowding-dependent jamming in the Deformable Parti-
cle (DP) model [35]. Interestingly, the Vertex and SPV
models [26, 32] also show a liquid-to-solid transition at
⟨S⟩≈3.81.
Note that the level of confluency can be described
by ϕ/ϕmax (ϕ/ϕmax = 1 implies full confluency) [35].
Though the absolute packing fraction cannot reach unity
in our particle-based model (unlike Vertex and SPV
models), we maintained a near-confluent regime, where
(ϕ/ϕmax) ∼0.94−1 across the transition (corresponding
to Fig. 2-4). This is similar to the in vivo experiment on
zebrafish tissues that show 80%-90% confluency [1].
However, to compare with Vertex and SPV models,
we performed the Voronoi tessellation of space (using
the cell centers) to obtain the Voronoi polygons cor-
responding to the cells (Fig.
S9A) and measured the
shape indices of the Voronoi cells, ⟨S⟩V or (see Section
VI, SI). We found that the liquid-solid transition takes
place at ⟨S⟩V or ≈3.81 for low values of Dr, similar to
the Vertex and SPV models [26, 32], though the transi-
tion point deviates from 3.81 for higher Dr (Fig. S9B-C).
Moreover, we achieved very high confluency by increas-
ing the rest length of cell edges (represented by Hookean
springs) and found that the packing fraction hardly al-
tered during the liquid-solid transition (ϕ ∼0.891−0.893,
i.e., (ϕ/ϕmax) ∼0.998 −1), when adhesion was in-
creased from zero (Fig. S10C-E). The average coordina-
tion number also stayed very high and almost constant
(Z ∼5.90−5.98) during the transition (Fig. S10F). This
indicates an adhesion-dependent active glass transition in
the confluent limit, not a crowding-dependent jamming.
Thus, tissue solidification arises from dampening the ac-
tive motility as higher adhesion leads to increased resis-
tance to shear forces between cells. Further, measuring
⟨S⟩V or from Voronoi cells again showed that the transi-
tion happens at ⟨S⟩V or ≈3.81 (Fig. S10G), exhibiting
the behavior of Vertex and SPV models [26, 32]. Never-
theless, the actual shape indices measured from cell con-
tours are non-monotonic across the transition (Fig. 4F,
S10H).
As shown before, in the passive limit, our active model
is similar to passive deformable particle (DP) models
[35, 44].
However, including ‘active and noisy’ motil-
ity is crucial to observe the glass transition. Though a
few studies included tunable confluency in the Voronoi
framework [7, 67], our implementation is distinct and
straightforward, inspired by DP models. There are also
a few active models of deformable cells like ours [68, 69].
However, the intracellular pressure in these models de-
pends on the instantaneous cell area, which is similar to
vertex-based models but distinct from our constant pres-
sure framework that aligns with in vivo measurement of
osmotic pressure in tissues [70].
Recently, a computa-
tional package [71] has been developed to simulate var-
ious soft materials, including biological tissues, foams,
bubbles, etc. However, this framework is overtly com-
plex (with 23 parameters), while ours is a simple coarse-
grained framework with a few parameters corresponding
to experiments (such as adhesion, intracellular pressure,
edge tension, etc.).
Application and future directions: Intriguingly,
despite having a distinct single-cell energy function com-
pared to the DP, Vertex, and SPV models, our model
still shows the liquid-solid transitions at ⟨S⟩V or ≈3.81
in certain limits. This may be tied to the argument of
isostaticity based on the polygonal tiling of the 2D space,
leading to an isostatic coordination number of Ziso = 5
(corresponding to the ⟨S⟩V or = 3.81 for a pentagon) as
explained in [26]. However, a detailed correspondence be-
tween the vertex-based framework and ours would be an
interesting future problem. Since real biological tissues
are near-confluent, our model is suitable for studying the
effect of confluency on active glassy behaviors. In near-
confluent systems, it is worthwhile to study the interplay
of two mechanisms of solidification: crowding-dependent
8
jamming (in sub-confluent regimes) and adhesion-driven
or tension-dependent rigidity transition (in full confluent
regimes) [72]. For instance, a recent study on Xenopus
development [73] shows the signatures of both mecha-
nisms.
Another work has discovered that periodic as-
semblies of myosin motors interconnect with the actin
cortex and act like a chain of sarcomeric units in each
epithelial cell [74]. Such an arrangement resembles our
bead-spring loops representing the cell cortex. The au-
thors found that the distance between sarcomeric units
changes upon perturbation of the actin cortex, and it
relaxes to the original state when the perturbation is re-
moved. Our model could be suitable to understand the
effect of such mechanical perturbation on cell shape and
tissue rigidity.
Moreover, a detailed continuum model
has recently explored how T1 transitions emerge from
stochastic formation and dissociation of cell-cell adhesive
bonds at the level of a few cells [75]. Since T1 transitions
spontaneously emerge at the tissue level in our coarse-
grained model, an interesting question would be how the
T1 transitions depend on confluency and adhesion.

MODEL DETAILS
A.
Force inherent to an isolated cell
Motivated from previous studies [43–45], a single cell is modeled as a closed loop of beads connected through elastic
springs with stiffness constant Ks and natural spring length l0 (Fig. S1). In our simulation, each cell is made up of
50 beads. Each bead experiences tangential tension forces from the two adjacent neighbor springs, and an internal
pressure force, Pl0, directed (outward) normal to the line tension of the given spring. (Fig. S1).

FIG. S1.
Bead-spring model of a single cell. The force components due to the tangential spring tension are shown in
black arrows. The blue arrows denote the normal components of the pressure force. The neighbors of the i-th bead are the
(i −1)-th and (i + 1)-th beads.
In a coarse-grained view, these intracellular forces describe the roles of the actomyosin cortex and cytoplasmic
pressure that give the cell its structural integrity. The intracellular force for the i-th bead can be explicitly written
as follows:
F intra
i
=
Ks(li −l0)ˆti −Ks(li+1 −l0)ˆti+1 + Pl0
2 (ˆni + ˆni+1)
(1)
Here, li is the bond length between i-th and (i −1)-th bead pair, and li+1 is the bond length between (i + 1)-th
and i-th beads, respectively. Also, ˆti and ˆti+1 are the tangential unit vectors, and ˆni and ˆni+1 are the corresponding
outward normal unit vectors perpendicular to ˆti and ˆti+1, respectively (see Fig. S1). The first two terms represent
the total spring-tension force, and the third term represents the outward pressure force on the i-th bead.
B.
Effect of cell-cell interactions
The intercellular force arising due to cell-cell interactions consists of two parts: (i) the spring-like attractive force,
which resembles the cell-cell adhesion through adhesive proteins (like E-cadherins), and (ii) the spring-like repulsion
that prevents the interpenetration among neighboring cells. Two beads of two different cells would feel the force of
adhesion or repulsion only when the Euclidean distance between them is below the cut-off range of the attractive or
repulsive forces. Thus the interaction force on the i-th bead of α-th cell due to the j-th bead of β-th cell is as follows:
F inter
ij,αβ = Kadh(rc
adh −rij,αβ)ˆrij,αβ , if rc

adh
= −Krep(rc

otherwise
(2)
2
Here, rij,αβ =
ri,α−rj,β
|ri,α−rj,β| is the unit vector of the Euclidean distance between the two interacting beads. Kadh and
rcadh are the strength and cut-off range, respectively, for the attractive force, and Krep and rcrep are that of the
repulsive force.
Now, considering all the contributions from other cells within the interaction ranges, the total force of interaction on
the i-th bead of the α-th cell would be :
F inter

j̸=i,β̸=α

(3)
C.
Active force term via self-propulsion and Equations of motion
In addition to the intracellular and intercellular forces, cells can also move via self-propulsion.
As in the self-
propelled particle (SPP) model [19] and self-propelled Voronoi (SPV) model [32], we also incorporate a polarity
vector ˆpα = (cos θα, sin θα) for every cell. In the direction of ˆpα, each bead of a cell exerts a self-generated motility
force of magnitude cv0, where c is the coefficient of viscous drag, and v0 is the self-propulsion speed. Thus, in each
cell, all the beads have the same polarity direction, but the polarity direction differs from cell to cell. All together,
the overdamped equation of motion for the i-th bead of the α-th cell is:
c ˙ri,α = F intra
i,α
+ F inter
i,α
+ cv0ˆpα
(4)
And, the unit polarity vector undergoes a rotational diffusion described as:
∂θα
∂t = ζα(t) ;
⟨ζα(t)ζβ(t′)⟩= 2Drδ(t −t′)δαβ,
(5)
where, ζα(t) is a Gaussian white noise with zero mean and variance 2Dr, which specifies the timescale for reorien-
tation of the polarity vectors as 1/Dr.
Thus Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) are the governing equations of motion in our model.
D.
Non-dimensional Parameters
To non-dimensionalize our governing equations, we take the unit of length as l0 and the unit of time as τ =
c
Ks
(where c is the coefficient of viscous drag and Ks is the spring constant for a single cell). Thus, the non-dimensional
position vector (˜r i,α) would be :
˜r i,α = r i,α/l0
⇒r i,α = ˜r i,αl0
(6)
And, non-dimensional time (˜t) would be :
˜t = t/τ
= tKs/c
⇒t = ˜tc/Ks
(7)
3
Therefore, replacing the position vectors and time with the non-dimensionalized values in Eq. (4), we obtain
cd(˜r i,αl0)
d(˜t c

P
Ks ,
˜Kint = Kint

and ˜v0 =

Kslo are dimensionless pressure, interaction strength, and self-propulsion speed, respectively.
Note that Eq. (8) is a non-dimensional form of Eq. (4). Treating Eq. (5) in a similar way, we get
∂θα
∂(˜tτ) = ζα(˜t) ; ˜ζα(˜t) = τζα(t/τ)
⇒∂θα
∂˜t = ζα(˜t)
(9)
and
⟨˜ζα(˜t)˜ζβ(˜t′)⟩= 2(Drτ)(δ(˜t −˜t′) = 2 ˜Drδ(˜t −˜t′)
(10)
Where, ˜Dr = Drc/Ks is the non-dimensional rotational noise strength. Thus, the main non-dimensional parameters
of our model are ˜P, ˜Kadh, ˜v0 and ˜Dr (ignoring ˜Krep, since we kept ˜Krep >> ˜Kadh).
II.
SIMULATION DETAILS
We consider a system of N = 256 cells in a square box of size L = 460l0. Each cell contains M = 50 beads. The bead
positions are updated by numerically integrating Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) using the Euler method. The time step is 10−3
and the total number of iterations is 107. The simulations are carried out using a periodic boundary condition.
A.
Initialization procedure
Generating nearly confluent tissue configuration:
To populate the desired number of cells in a given
square box, we choose a smaller initial radius for each cell.
In our simulation, the initial radius of each cell
is taken as a = 10l0, and the box length is chosen to be L = 460l0.
To avoid cell-cell overlap during the
random generation of cells, the minimum separation between two cell centers is chosen to be 2a + rrep
c
.
In a
square box of fixed length, L, we generate two random numbers from a uniform distribution as the X and Y
coordinates of each cell center.
The cell centers are then checked to meet the criterion of lying inside the box
and also have no overlap with already generated cells.
If there is an overlap, the cell center coordinates are
generated repeatedly till the criteria are met. The 50 beads that make up the cell boundaries are then positioned in
an equidistant manner along the perimeter of each cell such that the spring length between successive beads is 2πa/50.
Equilibrium dynamics of the tissue configuration: The initially generated cell-system is then evolved by
integrating Eq. (4) with ˜v0 = 0, i.e., we evolve the passive system without Eq. (5). During this time window, the
4
cells grow, and by interacting with each other, they approach a nearly confluent equilibrium configuration (with an
area fraction above 0.8). This equilibrium configuration then serves as an initial configuration for simulations of the
active system. In all our simulations, we equilibrate the randomly generated configurations up to the total iteration
of 5 × 104. Also note, to avoid any global drift of the system, we integrate Eq. (4) in the center of mass reference
frame, i.e., we use the transformed position vectors for each bead, r
′i,α = ri,α −Rcm, where Rcm is the position of
the center of mass of the entire tissue monolayer.
B.
Dynamics of the active system
Simulation of the active system: After the passive system attained an equilibrium configuration (described
above), we reset the time to zero. The final equilibrated configuration of the passive system is then used as the initial
configuration for the active dynamics of the tissues. The system is then evolved for a further 107 iteration steps with
a non-zero self-propulsion speed (˜v0 ̸= 0), and the dynamics is governed by both Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) simultaneously.
Measurement of observable quantities: We found that after 105 iterations, the active system entered into a
steady state, which was determined by observing the time evolution of the dynamical or structural observables like
instantaneous area fraction and the shape index (as defined in the next section). The steady-state was confirmed
when the observables fluctuated around a well-defined average value over time (as in Fig. 4(C-E), main text). We
took this approximate steady-state reaching time as the reference time (t0 = 105 iterations) for measuring the
dynamical quantities like MSD and the non-Gaussian parameter (as defined in the next section).
Code details:
The main simulation as well as codes for analysing the data are all written in FORTRAN
90.
We implemented the ‘cell linked-list’ algorithm [76] (which provides a significant speed-up) in the neigh-
bor search process to compute the intercellular forces.
The codes are available in the GitHub repository:

COMPARISON OF OUR MODEL WITH THE TOPOLOGICAL ENERGY FUNCTION OF VERTEX
AND VORONOI MODELS
The free energy of our model fundamentally differs from the topological energy function of Vertex/Voronoi-type
models. For instance, consider a single isolated cell at equilibrium. Under an isotropic pressure, the cell will attain
the equilibrium shape of an n-sided regular polygon having n beads and n springs (with spring constant Ks and rest
length l0). Following Fig. S2, the free energy is:
F = −nPl0(r −r0) + n
2 Ks(2∆l)2
= −nPl0(r −r0) + 2nKs(r −r0)2sin2(π/n),
(11)

FIG. S2. A single cell (at equilibrium) idealized as an n-sided regular polygon (here n = 8). An isotropic pressure force Pl0
inflates the cell, pushing each vertex point outward and increasing the radius of the circumcircle from r0 to r. Correspondingly,
the surface springs at the edges extend from l0 to (l0 + 2∆l). The diagram is not drawn to scale and is magnified for visual
clarity.
where the first term is the work done by the pressure, the second term is the spring energy, and we invoke the geometric
relation, ∆l = (r −r0)sin(π/n) (see Fig. S2). Differentiating Eq. (11) with respect to r, we obtain at equilibrium:
∂F
∂r = −nPl0 + 4nKs(r −r0)sin2(π/n) = 0.
(12)
Using the geometric relation, l0 = 2r0sin(π/n) (see Fig. S2 ), Eq. (12) can be reduced to
P = Ks(2∆l)/r0 = T/r0,
(13)
where T = Ks(2∆l) can be considered as the local surface tension at each edge. The Eq. (13) is basically the Young-
Laplace (YL) equation, which is thus satisfied in our model. In contrast, the vertex energy function for a single cell
is given by
E = KP
2 (p −p0)2 + KA
2 (a −a0)2,
(14)
where p and a are perimeter and area of a cell, while p0 and a0 are target perimeter and target area parameters,
respectively.
The first term in Eq. (14) is similar to the surface spring energy in our model.
However, the 2nd
term is the ‘area elasticity,’ which represents a pressure dependent on the cell’s instantaneous area (pressure,
P = KA(a −a0)). This is inconsistent with the YL equation, which is arguably responsible for the tendency of
rounding of a single cell during detachment [77, 78]. The YL equation was also invoked to quantify adhesion [78, 79],
and it formed the basis of inferring tension at cellular edges from analysis of tissue images [80, 81].
Since the
vertex energy function does not obey the YL equation, it can lead to skewed non-rounded shapes for a single cell
at equilibrium, depending on independent choices of a0 and p0. Thus, a single isolated cell is poorly defined in this
framework. An explicit ‘pressure’ term must be incorporated into the energy function to make it consistent with the
YL equation (see [82]).
IV.
MEASURED OBSERVABLES
A.
Mean Square Displacement (MSD)
To analyze the cell motions in the monolayer, we measured the mean square displacement (MSD) of the cell centers.
The MSD is defined as
MSD(∆t) := ⟨∆r 2(∆t)⟩
(15)
6
where
∆r = r α
cm(t0 + ∆t) −r α
cm(t0)
(16)
r αcm(t) = (PM
i=1 r i,α)/M is the position vector of the center of mass of the α-th cell at time instant t. The angular
bracket ⟨...⟩denotes the average over all the cells and over different ensemble runs.
B.
Effective Diffusivity
From the MSD, we determined the effective diffusivity Deff as a dynamical order parameter that differentiates the
solid and fluid phases and is defined as
Deff := lim
t→∞
MSD(∆t)
4D0∆t ,
(17)
where D0 = v02/2Dr is the self-diffusivity for an isolated single cell [32]. Deff is estimated from the slope of the linear
fits to the MSD curves at long time (from 5 × 106 to 107 iterations).
C.
Non-Gaussian Parameter
The non-Gaussian parameter (α2(∆t)), in 2D, is defined as [37] :
α2(∆t) := 1
2
⟨∆r 4(∆t)⟩
⟨∆r 2(∆t)⟩2 −1,
(18)
where ∆r is as defined in Eq. (16). This parameter includes the 2nd and 4th order moments of the distribution of
∆r. The parameter value is zero for a Gaussian distribution and becomes non-zero when the distribution deviates
from the Gaussian. The higher-order moments capture the deviation of the distribution, especially in the tail part,
which cannot be accounted for by MSD.
D.
Area Fraction
The area fraction in our model can be calculated in the following two ways. First, the area fraction (ϕ) of the tissue
monolayer at a particular time is given by
ϕ = (
N
X
α=1
Aα)/Abox
(19)
Here Aα is the area of the α-th cell, N is the cell number, and Abox = L2, is the area of the simulation box. This
definition considers the beads as point particles. However, since we have a cut-off range of the repulsion interaction
(rcrep), each bead can be treated as a disc of diameter rcrep, contributing a factor of (π/2)(rcrep/2)2 to the single cell
area. Thus, according to this factor, we can have a higher value of the area fraction given by
ϕ′ = ϕ + (MN/Abox)π(rc
rep)2/8
(20)
Here M is the bead number per cell. We calculated that ϕ ranges 0.85−0.88 across the extreme fluid and solid phases
(corresponding to Fig. 2 of our manuscript), while ϕ′ ∼0.93 −0.95 during the transition. Both these estimates show
high confluency, and the area fraction changes negligibly across the transition, as found during the liquid-to-solid
transition in dense zebrafish tissues [1].
E.
Shape Index
Following previous studies [26, 32], the cell shape index (S) is defined as:
S = 1
N
N
X
α=1
Pα
√Aα
(21)
7
Where Pα is the perimeter and Aα is the area of the α-th cell at a particular time instant. S denotes the averaged
shape index over all the cells at a particular instant. And, ⟨S⟩indicates the average of S over time and over different
simulations (ensemble average). While calculating ⟨S⟩, we averaged over the time window from 5×106 to 107 iterations
when the system is deep in the steady state, as confirmed from the temporal evolution of shape index (S) (see Fig.
4E, main text).
We also measured ⟨S⟩V or, the averaged shape index obtained from the Voronoi tessellated polygons. Following
standard protocol [35], we performed the Voronoi space tessellation from the actual cell center data in a simulated
tissue, to obtain the corresponding Voronoi polygons (see Fig. S9A). Then we calculated the shape index, SV or, for
each of the Voronoi polygons using Eq. 21. Note that, ⟨S⟩V or represents the ensemble average as well as the time
average in the steady-state (as stated above for measuring ⟨S⟩).
F.
Edge Tension
For the i-th bead of a particular cell at an instant, the edge tension is estimated as the extension of the corresponding
spring length (apart from a multiplicative constant):
Ti = |li −l0|
(22)
where, li is the instantaneous length of the spring between i-th and (i −1)-th beads of the cell and l0 is the rest
length. Then we calculated the average tension over all the beads of a cell and over all the cells as below:
T =
1
NM
N
X
α=1
M
X
i=1
Ti
(23)
G.
Coordination Number
By definition, the number of cells with which a particular cell is ‘in contact’, is the coordination number (Z) of that
particular cell [83]. Now, in our model, a particular cell, say the α-th cell, would be ‘in contact’ with the β-th cell
and vice versa, if any two beads of the two cells come within the interaction ranges, either rrep
c
or radh
c
. Thus, Z of
a particular cell at a particular time instant is the total number of cells that are interacting with it through either
repulsion or adhesion.
V.
JAMMING ONSET IN THE ‘PASSIVE LIMIT’ OF OUR MODEL
The ‘passive-tissue’ limit of our model essentially means the absence of any active self-propulsion vector (v0 = 0). In
this limit, we studied the system without cell-cell adhesion (Kadh = 0) in order to compare with previous studies on
the packing of soft grains [35, 43]. The intercellular interactions are purely repulsive in this case. We considered a
system of N = 256 cells in a square box of size L = 460l0, each cell containing M = 50 beads (same system size as
described in the ‘Simulation Details’ section). We followed the same initialization protocol stated in the ‘Simulation
Details’ section. Here, we performed the simulations using a ‘stiff’ or ‘rigid’ boundary condition. The stiff/rigid
boundary condition was implemented as follows: At a particular time instant t, if any bead of a cell touches the
boundary lines of the square box, i.e., if the Euclidean distance between the bead and any of the boundary lines
becomes smaller than the range of repulsion (rrep
c
), then the bead position was not updated, and the bead was kept
fixed to its previous position at the time instant t −dt (where dt is the integration timestep).
The system was then evolved by integrating Eq. 4 with ˜Kadh = 0 and ˜v0 = 0 (i.e., without Eq. 5) using the Euler
method with integration time step 10−3. We equilibrated the system by iterating up to 105 steps. The system then
reached an equilibrium configuration with a particular level of confluency, depending on the value of the intracellular
pressure ˜P. With increasing intracellular pressure, the equilibrium configurations slowly went from sub-confluent to
highly confluent. Thus, we took a series of ˜P values to generate configurations with increasing packing fractions (see
Fig S8(A-C)), similar to a protocol used in prior studies [43].
Finally, for each value of ˜P, we calculated the observable quantities like cell shape index, area fraction, coordina-
tion number, etc, by averaging over 50 independent simulation runs. During the calculations of the quantities, we
considered only the cells in the bulk, not those in contact with the box boundaries. Notably, we observed the onset
of crowding-dependent jamming in our passive model similar to the Deformable Particle (DP) model [35] published
before (see Fig. S8(D-E)). As shown in Fig. S8D, the tissue reaches the confluence when the normalized area fraction
8
reaches unity (ϕ/ϕmax = 1.0 with ϕmax = 0.883), at the measured shape index ⟨S⟩≈3.81. The average coordination
number Z ∼5.7 indicates a jammed confluent tissue at ⟨S⟩= 3.81 (Fig. S8E). Note that this value of Z at the
confluence is higher than the isostatic contact number for the Vertex model (Ziso = 5), as argued from the Voronoi
tesselation of the 2D space [26]. Interestingly, the Self-propelled Voronoi (SPV) model [32] also shows a liquid-to-solid
transition at ⟨S⟩≈3.81 in the zero motility limit. Also note that our model, despite having a distinct single-cell
energy function (in equilibrium) compared to the DP and Vertex models, still shows the jamming onset at ⟨S⟩≈3.81.
This indicates that the jamming onset can be explained from the argument of isostaticity based on the polygonal
tiling of the 2D space (since Ziso = 5 corresponds to the ⟨S⟩= 3.81 for a pentagon), as described in [26].
VI.
THE CONFLUENT LIMIT OF OUR MODEL
As discussed in the previous section (Section V of the SI), the level of confluency may be described by the average area
fraction normalized by the maximum area fraction in a parameter regime (ϕ/ϕmax). The tissue becomes confluent
as ϕ/ϕmax →1. Note that a particle-based description like our model cannot have ϕmax = 1 since two adjacent
cells have distinct, non-overlapping adjoining edges unlike the Voronoi-tessellation-based models, where adjacent cells
share a common edge with ‘zero-thickness’. In our case, ϕmax →1 only when the bead number per cell approaches
infinity. Nevertheless, 100% confluency is an idealization since in vivo tissues still show 80%-90% confluency (see Fig.
2e, 2h in [1]).
In the main paper, we kept the tissue at a near-confluent regime (where (ϕ/ϕmax) ∼0.94−1 across the transition).
We calculated that ϕ ranges 0.83−0.88 across the fluid and solid phases (corresponding to Fig. 2-4, main text), while
ϕ′ ∼0.91 −0.96 during the transition (note the slightly different definition of packing fractions, ϕ, and ϕ′, as given in
Eq. 19-20 in SI). These estimates show near-confluency, and the area fraction hardly changes across the transition.
As mentioned above, since our model does not attain ϕ = 1, we cannot directly compare the average shape
indices of cells with the shape indices of the Voronoi cells in the Vertex and SPV models. Thus, for comparison, we
performed the Voronoi tessellation of space (using the cell centers) to obtain the Voronoi polygons corresponding to
the cells (Fig. S9A), and we then measured the shape indices of the Voronoi cells (⟨S⟩V or, as defined in Sec. IV E,
SI). Interestingly, in this near-confluent regime, ⟨S⟩V or measured from the Voronoi polygons shows that the liquid-
solid transition takes place at ⟨S⟩V or ≈3.81 for the low values of rotational noise strength (Dr), similar to the
behavior of Vertex and SPV models [26, 32] (see Fig. S9B,C). However, for higher Dr, the phase boundary shifts from
⟨S⟩V or = 3.81 (Fig. S9C). Thus, our model replicates the behavior of the Vertex model in certain regimes if we treat
⟨S⟩V or as a structural order parameter. But, note that the actual shape index ⟨S⟩measured from cell contours are
nonmonotonic near the phase boundary (Fig. 4F, main text), contrasting the behavior of the Vertex model.
Furthermore, as our model has tunable confluency depending on parameter variations, we could achieve high
confluency by increasing the natural spring length (l0 from 0.1 to 0.14) and explored the effect of increasing adhesion
from zero to a much higher value (see Fig. S10(A-B)). Though the packing fraction did not alter up to the second
decimal place (ϕ = 0.891 −0.893), the MSD of cell centers still showed a liquid-solid transition, where the cell
dynamics changed from sub-diffusive to caged (plateau) behavior with adhesion (Fig. S10C, D). The transition points
are located based on a cut-off value of the MSD exponent (see Fig. S10D, where the cut-off exponent was set to 0.2).
Notably, the average packing fraction (both ϕ and ϕ′) hardly changed across the liquid-solid transition, suggesting
a rigidity-driven glass transition, not a crowding-dependent jamming (Fig. S10E). Also, note that the values of the
area fraction in Fig. S10E are well above the critical packing fraction for jamming transition in passive foams — in
previous simulations of the ‘deformable polygon model’ and ‘dynamic vertex model,’ the critical packing fraction for
jamming was reported to be ϕc ∼0.83 in 2D (see Fig. 2f in [7] and Fig. 4a in [84]). Thus, for the chosen parameters
of our model, the tissue is already ‘jammed’ without adhesion, showing sub-diffusive dynamics with active cellular
motility (Fig. S10C). However, with increasing adhesion, solidification arises from dampening the active motility of
cells, which is caused by the increased resistance to shear forces between cells due to higher adhesion.
Moreover, the solidification in the highly confluent state accompanied a negligible change in the average contact
number per cell (Z changes from 5.90 to 5.98 in Fig. S10F corresponding to the red and blue curves, representing
the confluent limit). In this regard, a simple counting of constraints for passive non-adhesive spheres shows that the
critical isotactic contact number for jamming is Zc ∼4 in 2D. Note, the degrees of freedom for N cells is nDOF = 2N,
while the number of constraints is nc = ZN/2 as each contact is shared between two cells. This leads to Zc = 4
when nDOF = nc (see [85]). However, another constraint counting argument based on the Voronoi tesselation of the
2D space suggests that the isostatic value of Z at the confluence should be Zvor
iso = 5, as explained for the Vertex
model [26]. Importantly, as shown in Fig. S10F, our observed contact number in the confluent limit is above both the
estimated isostatic values (Zc = 4 and Zvor
iso = 5). Thus, the solidification is essentially an adhesion-dependent active
glass transition, not crowding-dependent jamming.
Additionally, in the confluent limit, we measured both the average shape indices from the Voronoi cells (⟨S⟩V or)
9
and from the actual cell contours (⟨S⟩) (Fig. S10G, H). Notably, the liquid-solid transition boundaries (pinpointed
by arrowheads in Fig. S10D) closely coincide with ⟨S⟩V or ≈3.81 (Fig. S10G), again exhibiting the Vertex and SPV
model-like behavior [26, 32] for the given parameter choices. Nevertheless, the actual shape indices still show non-
monotonic behavior across the transition (Fig. S10H), similar to what was observed before (as in Fig. 4F, main text).

Jamming onset in the ‘passive limit’.
We obtained the ‘passive limit’ of our model by switching off the
self-propulsion speed (v0 = 0) in the absence of cell-cell adhesion (Kadh = 0). Jammed states are formed by systematically
increasing the intracellular pressure (consequently increasing the packing fraction) in a box with rigid boundaries. For more
details, see the SI text, Section V. (A-C) Steady state simulation snapshots with increasing packing fractions: ϕ/ϕmax = 0.84
(A), 0.95 (B), and 1.0 (C). (D) Normalized area fraction (ϕ/ϕmax) and (E) the average contact number per cell (Z), as
functions of the averaged shape index (⟨S⟩). The tissue reaches the confluence when the normalized packing fraction becomes
unity (ϕ/ϕmax = 1) at the measured shape index ⟨S⟩≈3.81 (shown by the vertical dashed line in D). The maximal packing
fraction achieved is ϕmax = 0.883, as shown by the horizontal dotted line in panel D. The average coordination number Z ∼5.7
indicates a jammed confluent state at ⟨S⟩= 3.81 (indicated by the vertical dashed line in E). Parameters: ˜Kadh = 0, v0 = 0,

Solidification at highly confluent tissues. (A-B) Tissue configurations for ˜Kadh = 0 (A) and ˜Kadh = 0.25
(B). Note that high confluence was achieved by increasing l0. (C) MSD of cell centers (corresponding to ˜Kadh values as in
panels A and B), showing a transition from sub-diffusive to caged behavior. The dashed line shows the MSD exponent of 0.67
for ˜Kadh = 0. (D) MSD exponent (β) shows transition with ˜Kadh at a lower ˜Dr (red curve) and at a higher ˜Dr (blue curve).
The blue and red arrowheads indicate the transition points (and corresponding ˜Kadh values) based on a cut-off, β = 0.2, as
shown by the dotted horizontal line. (E) The area fraction (both ϕ and ϕ′, as defined in Sec. IVD, SI) and (F) the average
contact number per cell (Z), are plotted against ˜Kadh for the highly confluent tissues at two different ˜Dr values (red and blue
ones). Note that in panels D, E, and F, the black dashed curve is for the parameters corresponding to Fig. 2E (main text),
given here for comparison with a near-confluent tissue. Notably, ϕ and Z are almost constant for the fully confluent tissue
compared to the near-confluent tissue denoted by the dashed reference curves. (G) The average shape index measured from
the Voronoi tessellated polygons (⟨S⟩V or), and (H) the average shape index (⟨S⟩) obtained from the actual cell contours, are
plotted against ˜Kadh. In G, the blue and red arrowheads indicate the ˜Kadh values corresponding to ⟨S⟩V or = 3.81, which
coincide with the liquid-solid transition points located in panel D. For all panels, l0 = 0.14 except the dashed reference curve
(in D-F), for which l0 = 0.1. Other parameters are from Fig. 3 (main text) and Table S1.

SUPPLEMENTAL MOVIE CAPTIONS
Movie S1. Fluid tissue phase (low adhesion regime). The steady-state dynamics of the tissue exhibiting a
liquid-like phase at (low) adhesion strength ˜Kadh = 8.3 × 10−5. A group of neighboring cells are marked in red and
green to highlight a T1 transition. Also, note the freely diffusive dynamics of the cells. Parameter values: ˜P = 0.2,
˜v0 = 16.6 × 10−3, ˜Dr = 5.2 × 10−4. Other parameters are from Table S1.
Movie S2. Solid tissue phase (high adhesion regime). The steady-state dynamics of the tissue exhibiting a
solid-like phase at (high) adhesion strength, ˜Kadh = 0.25. A randomly chosen cell is marked red to highlight that its
motion is completely caged by its neighbors. Rest of the parameter values are the same as in Movie S1.
