Abstract
Background: The success of embolisation, a minimally invasive treatment of liver
cancer, could be evaluated in the operational room with cone-beam CT by acquiring
a dynamic perfusion scan to inspect the contrast agent flow.
Purpose: The reconstruction algorithm must address the issues of low temporal sam-
pling and higher noise levels inherent in cone-beam CT systems, compared to conven-
tional CT.
Methods: Therefore, a model-based perfusion reconstruction based on the time sep-
aration technique (TST) was applied.
TST uses basis functions to model time at-
tenuation curves. These functions are either analytical or based on prior knowledge,
extracted using singular value decomposition of the classical CT perfusion data of an-
imal subjects. To explore how well the prior knowledge can model perfusion dynamics
and what the potential limitations are, the dynamic CBCT perfusion scan was simu-
lated from a dynamic CT perfusion scan under different noise levels. The TST method
was compared to static reconstruction.
Results: It was demonstrated on this simulated dynamic CBCT perfusion scan that
a set consisting of only four bases results in perfusion maps that preserve relevant in-
formation, denoises the data, and outperforms static reconstruction under higher noise
levels. TST with prior knowledge would not only outperform static reconstruction, but
also the TST with analytical bases. Furthermore, it has been shown that only eight

CBCT rotations, unlike previously assumed ten, are sufficient to obtain the perfusion
maps comparable to the reference CT perfusion maps. This contributes to saving dose
and reconstruction time. The real dynamic CBCT perfusion scan, reconstructed under
the same conditions as the simulated scan, shows potential for maintaining the accu-
racy of the perfusion maps. By visual inspection, the embolised region was matching
to that in corresponding CT perfusion maps.
Conclusions: CBCT reconstruction of perfusion scan data using the TST method
has shown promising potential, outperforming static reconstructions and potentially
saving dose by reducing the necessary number of acquisition sweeps. Further analysis
of a larger cohort of patient data is needed to draw final conclusions regarding the
expected advantages of the time separation technique.

Introduction
Dynamic computed tomography perfusion (dCTp) imaging of the liver is an important non-
invasive modality to inspect, quantify and visualise haemodynamic changes in the liver, in
order to diagnose and characterise liver cancer, to plan and perform the treatment, and
to assess the response to the treatment1,2.
For a minimally invasive treatment, such as
embolisation, it would be beneficial to have cone-beam CT (CBCT), and related CBCT
perfusion (dCBCTp) acquisition protocols, within the interventional suite, so the patient
does not have to be moved outside of the operating room3,4.
In this way, not only the
tumour-feeding vessels could be detected but also it could be inspected whether the blood
flow to the desired region was blocked5.
The idea for the dynamic liver perfusion imaging using CBCT came from parenchymal
perfusion imaging using CBCT and its inability to be comparable to dCTp imaging6,7. In
perfusion imaging, a contrast agent is injected intravenously to enhance the visibility of the
organ’s internal structures. After the injection, a series of time-resolved CT volume images is
acquired. For parenchymal perfusion imaging, only one rotation (sweep) around the patient
is performed after the injection. In one sweep, lasting ∼4 s, 2D projections covering 200◦
angle are acquired. The volume is then reconstructed using all the 2D projections as if
all were acquired at the same time point, disregarding the dynamic nature of perfusion8.
For dynamic perfusion imaging first, more sweeps need to be acquired6 and second, the
reconstruction approach should take into account for the time dependency of every acquired
2D projection.
Reconstructing the proposed ten separate sweeps6 over a complete scan
duration of ∼52 s and determining perfusion in this way would be subject to significant
errors9.
A model-based approach can utilise the fact that data from every projection angle are
recorded multiple times, i.e., once in every sweep, to mitigate undersampling problems. In
case of the dCBCTp perfusion of the brain, the so-called time separation technique (TST)
was used to denoise the data and accurately estimate time attenuation profiles of the contrast
agent10,11,12. The TST uses an orthogonal basis functions set (BFS) to model the perfusion
dynamics, so the reconstruction problem is simplified and the overall computational time is
reduced. In this research applicability and potential advantages of TST for liver perfusion
imaging with dCBCTp were investigated. The algorithms were tested using animal models,

were acquired13.

Data Acquisition
Three corresponding dCTp and dCBCTp scans of three different pig livers were acquired with
a SOMATOM Force CT and an ARTIS pheno robotic C-arm system (Siemens Healthineers
AG, Forchheim, Germany). The three animals were labelled with numbers from 1 to 3. The
study was conducted in accordance with the European Directive 2010/63/EU and with the
German law for animal protection (TierSchG). All experiments were approved by the local
animal ethics committee (Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food
Safety, LAVES 18/2809).
The three dCBCTp scans were acquired using the same acquisition protocols (see Ta-
ble 1).
The subsegment artery of the right hepatic artery was embolised with Onyx(R)
(Medtronic, Meerbusch, Germany). The contrast material Imeron 300 was injected into the
right hepatic artery. The C-arm performs 10 rotations in a bidirectional manner, pausing
between consecutive rotations. In this way, five forward and five backward sweeps are ac-
quired. The first two sweeps are mask sweeps, one for the forward and one for the backward
rotation as shown in Fig. 1. Each sweep comprises 248 views. There is an inconsistency
between the angles at which the corresponding views with index i in forward and index
(248−i) in backward sweep are acquired. The time intervals between two consecutive views,
i.e. frame time, differ within the sweep due to the accelerating rotation of the C-arm at
the beginning of the scan and decelerating towards the end of the scan. The duration of all
dCBCTp scans, including all 10 rotations, is ∼52 s. The rotation time lies around 3.9 s with
the pause time between two rotations of ∼1.4 s.
The scanning durations of the dCTp scan for animals 1, 2, and 3 were 65.997 s, 56.997 s
and 41.998 s, respectively. The tube peak voltage for the dCTp scans was set to 90 kv. The
matching dCBCTp and dCTp scans have the same contrast agent injection protocols as
documented in Table 2. The animals were in general anesthesia with muscle relaxation to
avoid any muscle movements such as breathing.

CBCT scan simulation
As the different positioning of the animal in CT and in the corresponding CBCT makes it dif-
ficult to compare both volumes voxel-wise, the dCBCTp scan was simulated by reprojecting
the dCTp scan, referred to as rdCBCTp. Due to data limitation (see Sec. II.D.2.) only the
shortest dCTp scan was reprojected. To maintain a realistic rotation velocity of the C-arm,
the rdCBCTp scan consists of eight contrast-enhanced sweeps. The time-resolved volumes
are interpolated using Akima splines14, and resampled at time points defined by the frame
times of the original corresponding dCBCTp scan during eight sweeps. These were estimated

from the DICOM header Frame Time Vector. The forward projector algorithm of the CT
Library15 was used to simulate dCBCTp projection data from the dCTp volumes, where
the projection matrix of the forward sweep of the real dCBCTp scan was used to model the
geometry. To avoid the need for 2D-2D registration to compensate for angle inconsistency
of forward and backward sweeps, the order of the forward projection matrix was reversed
to estimate the backward sweep geometry. Although the breathing was suppressed, some
motion is still present in the intestines.
The voxel size for reconstruction is the same as the voxel size of the matching CT scan,
(0.7305 mm, 0.7305 mm, 1.5 mm). The voxel count in one volume is 512 × 512 × 175.
II.B.1.
Noise Addition
Considering that the CBCT scans suffer from higher noise levels than CT, two different levels
of Poisson noise, higher noise of 2.1 × 105 photons per mm2 and moderate noise of 6 × 105
photons per mm2 at the detector16,17, were added to reprojected dCBCTp scan.
II.C.
Reconstruction
The reconstruction from the dCTp scan is a 4D reconstruction task because the contrast
enhancement varies dynamically during the acquisition of the volume time series. Each voxel
in the volume is defined by the four coordinates, (x, y, z, t), where z denotes the slice, x, y the
positions of the voxel in the slice, and t ∈I represents a time point during the scan duration
I. The time attenuation curve (TAC) describes the contrast agent dynamics in each voxel at
all sampling time points t. TACs are extracted from the reconstructed volumes. Therefore,
the reconstruction problem is a time-dependent CT problem.
Ax(t) = p(t)
t ∈I
(1)
where A is the system matrix that maps volume x at time point t onto the projection space
p.
In a dCBCTp scan at a single time point t ∈[0, Ts], where Ts = 4s is the duration of
one sweep, a 2D projection for one source-detector position, i.e., angle φi, i ∈{1, .., Φ}, is
acquired. In ten-sweep acquisition protocol, only 10 projections for the same φi are acquired

over the scan duration T = 52s. This makes the reconstruction problem Eq. 1 in the domain
of dCBCTp scan reconstruction underdetermined. The time interval for the same φi between
every two sweeps, due to a bidirectional rotation of the C-arm and pause time between sweeps
is not constant.
In the straightforward reconstruction approach12, each sweep is reconstructed separately
under the assumption that all the projections in one sweep have been acquired at the same
time point, and thus the dynamic change of contrast agent flow through the organ is not
properly represented. This limits the quantifiability of the perfusion maps.
The TST11,12 relies on the idea of model-based reconstruction (MBR). Both voxels’
dynamics x(t) and projections p(t) are represented as the linear combination of the same
orthonormal basis functions set (Eq. 2).
B = {Ψ1, . . . , ΨN},
N →∞
(2)
Furthermore, the TST assumes that with a very suitable orthonormal bases (see Sec.
II.D.2.), only the first ˆN ≤5 elements would be sufficient to model perfusion.

the reconstruction problem Eq. 1 becomes ˆN separate CT problems
Awi = ci
i ∈ˆN,
(7)
which simplifies the reconstruction task in such a way that the number of reconstructions
that need to be performed equals the number of bases ˆN used to model the time dynamics.
Now, c from Eq. 4 are determined by calculating the scalar product
⟨p(t), Ψ(t)⟩.
(8)
The calculation of scalar product is problematic since it assumes that the bases are
already sampled at the time points at which the projections are acquired. To carry out the
integration for the scalar product estimation, the interpolation of the projections would be
acquired, which would lead to significant errors. To circumvent this problem, an optimisation
approach was applied as follows:
min
{c} ∥Ψ(t) · c −p(t)∥2 =: c′.
(9)
Instead of determining the coefficients c from the scalar products, they are defined as the
parameters that best approximate the function p. It should be noted that this fitting method
leads to the following approximation
p(t) =

(10)
The prerequisite step is to resample the basis functions at time points specific to each
pixel p(x,y,φ). Subsequently, these fitted projections are reconstructed and the coefficients
wi, i ∈{1, .., ˆN} are obtained.
From these reconstructed coefficients, the time series of
volumes for a given sampling can be computed.
The choice of a proper reconstruction algorithm is only limited by Eq. 7. Here, all
the reconstructions are computed using a Krylov method based iterative reconstruction to
reduce the computation time18.

Basis Function Sets
The bases have to be suitable for modelling the contrast agent flow, i.e., to approximate the
contrast agent flow with as few as ˆN bases. Thus, two different BFSs are used, an analytical

Analytical Set
A set of trigonometric functions (see Eq.11) was successfully used to model brain perfusion12.
Furthermore, the same bases set was also used to model liver perfusion using a real dCBCTp
scan13. The first basis is a constant necessary to model static behaviour of the anatomical
background.

The prior knowledge BFS extracted from the CT perfusion time-resolved volumes should
optimally model the dynamics of liver perfusion19. Here, the prior knowledge (PK) BFS was
extracted from CT time series of only two animals; see Fig. 2. This BFS was tested against
the third dCBCTp and rdCBCTp scan.

Orthonormal basis functions were extracted from these volumes using SVD20. The number of
the singular vectors forming the set is determined by the elbow method21, and all remaining
vectors were considered as noise and omitted. In this work the number of selected basis
functions was ˆN = 4.

The SVD is applied only within the duration of the shortest scan — ∼42 s, meaning it is
covering all eight sweeps in rdCBCTp scan. Applying SVD over longer scan duration, would
assume that the volumes of the shortest scan wouldn’t be able to cover the whole interval
and the cross-validation would not be possible. For extraction of PK, the two scans were
aligned in time with respect to the peak of the arterial input function(AIF). The aligning
is performed by shifting one of the scans in time. The AIF was selected based on its peak
value and time point at which this peak occurred. Fig. 3 shows how the time alignment is
performed w.r.t. the duration of the scans via the AIF.

with respect to the AIF for extraction of prior knowledge.
II.D.3.
Time Shifting of Bases
The PK and the projections are time dependent and to model the contrast agent flow through
the organ correctly, the PK might need to be shifted in time. The shift is determined after
the time alignment of CBCT scan and bases interval. The time alignment is performed in
the same manner as the alignment of the CT scans for the extraction of the prior knowledge.
Two types of time shifting are to be differentiated but not mutually exclusive. The first type
of the shifting occurs when the bases cannot support the whole CBCT scan interval. Then,
all the values of the pixel p(x,y,φ) that were acquired outside the supported interval, at the
beginning or at the end of the scan, will be excluded from the fit (see Fig. 4). The second

shift occurs when the bases interval has to be cropped. Then both, offset at the beginning
and the offset at the end of the bases interval could be needed (see Fig. 5).

For the data used in this work, only the first type of basis shifting was needed. For the
real dCBCTp scan the projections of the first two mask sweeps were outside the supported
interval, meaning that the fitting started at the beginning of the third sweep. The AIF of
the rdCBCTp reaches its peak value 1.5 s after the AIF based on which the CT scans for the
PK were aligned so all the projections from the first 1.5 s were excluded from the fitting.
II.E.
Calculation of Perfusion Maps
The final step in perfusion imaging is the calculation of the perfusion maps. Perfusion maps
are the visualisation of the perfusion parameters. The first volume is considered a mask
sweep and is subtracted from all the following volumes in time series so that the perfusion
parameters can be calculated22. With the TST, the value of each voxel in time point over
the scanning interval is estimated using reconstructed coefficients and the BFS. The first
estimated value is subtracted from the rest, so that the time attenuation curve represents
only the time dynamics of the voxel.
Since a small amount of contrast agent was injected into the right hepatic artery at
a high rate, no contrast agent is expected in the portal vein during the acquisition time.
Therefore, only four perfusion parameters are calculated in the arterial phase, blood flow
(BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP). Previously, it
was shown that the embolised regions are better distinguishable in perfusion maps calculated
using the deconvolution method in comparison to the maximum slope approach. Also, the
MTT can be miscalculated with the maximum slope approach even with the high injection
rate of contrast agent23,24.
Thus, the perfusion parameters are calculated here using a
deconvolution algorithm25.
The perfusion parameters are calculated voxel-wise. The TAC of each voxel v, tacv(t) is
represented as a convolution of arterial input function (AIF) aif(t) and convolution kernel

taci(t) = aif(t) ∗ki(t).
(12)
This problem can be represented algebraically
Ak = c
(13)
where A is the Toeplitz matrix constructed from discretised AIF. Now, k is found by solving
k = A−1c.
(14)
SVD is applied on A, then all singular values larger than the Tikhonov regulariser λrel =
0.3 ∗σmax are inverted, σ = 1/σ, and all smaller than λrel set to σ = 0. This way the new
matrix A′ is formed and, A−1 is replaced by it, so that
k′ = A′c
(15)
can be estimated25. Once k′ is estimated, the perfusion parameters for each voxel v with
TAC sampled in n = 100 points are calculated as follows
BFv = max{kv,i, i ∈{1..n}},
BVv =
n
X
i=1
kv,
MTTv = BVv
BFv
.
(16)
The TTP is not dependent on the convolution kernel, but only on the TAC and it equals
the time point at which the TAC reaches its peak enhancement.
For the visualisation of perfusion maps, the ASIST26 colourmap is used. With this
colourmap, the hypo-perfused — in this case embolised (dark blue), region is easily dis-
tinguishable from the healthy perfused tissue.
For all perfusion maps, the lower values
are represented with cold colours and vice versa for higher values. A Gaussian blur with
σ = 3.0 px is applied slice-wise to the organ in the perfusion map to ensure noise reduction
and for features to be better distinguishable.
II.E.1.
Selection of Arterial Input Function
The wrong selection of the AIF can result in a miscalculation of the perfusion parameters.
The AIF was localised in a single voxel12. First, the region of interest (ROI) in a vessel in
which the contrast agent was injected was selected. Here, the ROI was selected in the right

hepatic artery. From this region a single voxel is selected to be the AIF. The AIF should
be selected in the same region for CT and rCBCT27, and when possible in the real CBCT
volume as well. Selecting AIFs in different vessels would not only affect the calculation of
the perfusion parameter values, but also the overall quality of the perfusion maps. The AIF
with the highest peak reached in the earliest time point was selected as the single-point AIF.

Evaluation of Perfusion Maps
II.F.1.
Simulated Dynamic CBCT Perfusion Scan
Simulation of the dCBCTp scan enables voxel-wise comparison of the perfusion maps by
calculating the Pearson correlation for every slice. This is possible since the organ is not
displaced compared to the dCTp scan. As a consequence, it has suffered from organ trunca-
tion not only in the z-axis but also in the xy-plane. In addition, the motion of the intestines
was captured, which can result in streak artefacts. Thus, to analyse only reconstructed vox-
els that are not severely affected by these occurrences, an additional mask excluding these
regions was used for calculation of Pearson correlation coefficients.
II.F.2.
Real Dynamic CBCT Perfusion Scan
The position of the animal during the dCTp scan was not the same as during the real
dCBCTp scan. To fit it into the field of view of the C-arm CT, the animal was shifted and
tilted. Thus, only a qualitative assessment was performed through visual inspection. To find
the corresponding slices, features in the slice, such as position of the gallbladder, stomach,
ribs and spine were located and compared.

reconstruction from reconstructed volumes for every sweep, and in MBR with the TST -
from time-resolved volumes. The noise affects the AIF reached peak values but not the
overall relation between them compared to the CT AIF. For all rCBCT AIFs, the peak
value is lower compared to the reference CT AIF except for the TST with prior knowledge
with high noise. The AIF peak of TST with analytical bases is the only one close in time to
the reference CT AIF occurring 0.43 s later. The same is observable in all three noise levels.
Modelling the AIF with analytical basis functions (rCBCT TST-Analytical) can result in an
additional peak so that it resembles the peak due to reperfusion or reinjection of contrast
agent material. The occurrence of the AIF peak for static reconstruction almost 5 s earlier
is due to an assumption that all the views within one sweep are considered to be acquired
within the same time point. The AIF similarity in shape is observable in all noise scenarios
for the AIF modelled by the prior knowledge(rCBCT TST-PK).

The Pearson correlation coefficients between the CT perfusion maps and rCBCT per-
fusion maps using AIFs from the Figures 6, 7 and 8, for static reconstruction (”Static”)
and MBR by the means of TST using analytical (”Analytical”) and prior knowledge basis
functions (”Prior”) are given in Table 3. The regions in slices with reconstruction artefacts
were not taken into account. For the BF and MTT, the TST with prior knowledge bases
outperforms static reconstruction for all three noise scenarios. As noise levels rise, the cor-
relation values for static reconstruction are decrease. Even though the same behaviour is
expected, and it is, for all three CBCT reconstructions, it is the most pronounced for the
static reconstruction. For the MTT, the Pearson correlation is below 0.5 for static recon-
struction and for TST with analytical bases, unlike 0.7118 for TST with prior knowledge
for high noise. With the TST the change in correlation between different noise levels is
smaller than in case of the static reconstruction, with BF remaining the most stable with
prior knowledge.The change in AIF values and shape did not indicate these occurrences,
since the shape of the CBCT AIFs for moderate and high noise is more similar to CT AIF,
see Figures 7 and 8. For BV, the TST with analytical bases is the best and remains this
way independently of the noise levels. However, the TST, neither with analytical nor prior
knowledge bases, manages to outperform the static reconstruction for TTP, except for the
high noise, for the insignificant difference of 0.0009.
The perfusion maps, BF, BV, MTT and TTP, for the slice at the middle of the liver
are shown in Fig. 10 for the scenario of moderate noise level. In the first column are the
CT perfusion maps, then perfusion maps calculated for simulated dCBCTp scan in order

and TST using prior knowledge consisting of four bases (”TST Prior”). The hypo-perfused
region, i.e., embolised region, is easily distinguishable in all perfusion maps. The healthy
tissue, i.e., well perfused regions, are clearly visible as well. The misestimation of perfusion
values due to streak artefacts are visible in the upper part of the organ for all four parameters
in the rCBCT perfusion maps.
For the BF, this is the most pronounced for TST with
prior knowledge bases. In static reconstruction and in TST with prior knowledge bases,
the underestimation in comparison to CT can be observed, particularly around the vessel
structures. This region is pointed by white arrow in 10. Nevertheless, the BV of TST with
prior knowledge is the most similar to CT. For the MTT, the misestimation due to the
mentioned reconstruction artefacts is observable in static reconstruction and for TST with
prior knowledge bases. This region for the MTT in static reconstruction is indicated by a
yellow arrow. For all four parameters, the most similar to CT perfusion maps are the ones
depicted in the fourth column of the TST with prior knowledge. Under moderate noise,
the TST was not yet able to outperform the static reconstruction for the TTP. This can
be especially visible for the TTP with TST with prior knowledge. With increasing noise,
the TST with prior knowledge appears to be more comparable to CT perfusion maps (see
Table 3). The noise was reconstructed and is visible in perfusion maps, see second and third
column, unlike for the TST with prior knowledge. Also, some overestimation is visible in
static reconstruction, particularly for BV.

prior knowledge bases (”CBCT TST-PK”). All of the AIFs reach their peak at different
time points, with the AIF modelled with TST using prior knowledge having the highest
peak value. Note that due to different CT modalities, the values of perfusion parameters
cannot be compared. The AIF for the static reconstruction is shifted the most, which is
expected considering the time considerations for the acquired projections. The analytical
bases do have the peak closest in time to the CT peak, but lower. The same was noted for
the reprojected CBCT scan. The AIF with TST with prior knowledge is the closest to the
CT AIF in peak value.

The perfusion maps for the dCBCTp scan of animal 3 is shown in Fig. 11. The hypo-
perfused region is well distinguishable in static and TST with analytical bases. However, for
the prior knowledge, some overestimation can be noticed in some regions, which also makes
the hypo-perfused region less pronounced - pointed by the yellow arrow. What additionally
reduces the quality of perfusion maps are the artefacts, which result in streaks of overperfused
regions that are not comparable to the CT scan. However, the MTT with analytical bases
is the least comparable to CT perfusion maps. This is particularly visible in the left part
of the organ. The BV of TST with analytical bases is showing some underestimation in the
upper regions, but with the prior knowledge these overestimations still result in a perfusion
map in general more similar to CT. For the MTT, the TST with prior knowledge is overall
the most similar. However, the hypo-perfused region is still misinterpreted in terms of TTP
- pointed by the white arrow.

Discussion
In this work, it was shown that the dynamic perfusion CBCT scan of eight sweeps is suf-
ficient for dynamic liver perfusion imaging, which can be beneficial for minimally invasive
treatments of liver cancers. Independently of the BFS used, the model-based perfusion re-
construction by the means of TST has provided the perfusion maps in which there is a clear
distinction of hypo-perfused region, i.e., the embolised region. This scenario first leads to a
shorter scan time and saving radiation dose compared to the proposed scanning protocol6 for
dynamic CBCT perfusion, and second, it saves computation time due to the lower number of
reconstructions that need to be performed. Here, only four bases are enough to describe the
dynamic behaviour of the liver. In addition, these bases were only extracted from the CT
time-series volumes of two different animals (see Fig. 2), with a slightly different contrast
agent injection protocol, and were used to model the dynamics of the third animal. The
results show that the TST not only provides the perfusion maps quickly to the radiologist,
but also makes the perfusion maps more accurate by compensating for the low temporal
sampling. The TST with analytical or prior knowledge bases can outperform static recon-
struction, especially for higher noise levels (see Table 3). The AIF was always best modeled
by the TST with prior knowledge and the TST with prior knowledge resulted in perfusion
maps more similar to CT perfusion maps (see Fig. 10).
The TST with prior knowledge is influenced by many factors that cannot be easily
addressed. Here, only two CT scans were available for prior knowledge extraction, and they
could not be averaged enough with SVD to try to avoid the necessity of time alignment of
CT scans. The time alignment is performed on the basis of the AIF peak position, which
is affected by the anatomy of the scanned subjects, the contrast agent injection protocol,
and the actual localisation AIF. Next, the scalar product should be calculated, but then
insufficient data is available for use to model the dynamics and the interpolation performed
based on the very small number of points. Also, depending on the bases shift, either the
PK will get violated through the reorthogonalisation or, the CBCT data will be lost due
to exclusion of the projections for which the PK is not provided. However, with all these
demerits, the TST still managed to model the perfusion correctly under high noise.
CT scans cannot be considered completely noise-free.
When the SVD is applied to
extract the PK, there is a possibility that some of the noise remains present in singular

vectors forming the BFS. For the extraction of the bases, the TACs of CT time-series are
interpolated using Akima splines, which can result in error, since with the cubic splines the
value between two points can be overestimated.
Although prior knowledge extracted from only two animals was sufficient to reconstruct
the dCBCTp scan, it is not clear if the same would be possible for any dCBCTp scan,
especially with a different contrast agent injection protocol. Next, the AIF with the BFS
formed with more than four bases, namely seven, would have a higher amplitude19. However,
using more bases causes instabilities in fitting, and inability to produce meaningful perfusion
maps11,19. Here, already four bases were used to model seven points. Therefore, the number
of bases should be kept as low as possible.
The AIF was selected at one single point in static reconstructions, and this makes it
susceptible to higher noise. Also, without the 3D registration of the real CBCT and CT
volumes, the selection of the AIF in both is only based on the anatomy knowledge. Thus,
the AIF could be calculated by weighted averaging of all the voxels from the selected ROI.
Without the static reconstruction, the AIF should be selected in one of the reconstructed TST
coefficients. For doing so, one should know which of the bases contains the most information
about the vessels’ dynamics, and then select the appropriate reconstructed coefficient to
select the AIF. This imposes problems for the automation of the AIF selection within the
TST approach. Just by selecting a slightly different AIF location or, mistakenly, a completely
different vessel in CBCT compared to CT, might result in a completely wrong estimation
of the perfusion maps27. However, it is valuable to note that the actual values of perfusion
parameters do not differ much between the comparing perfusion maps and that not for
all perfusion parameters. Using the deconvolution method for the estimation of perfusion
parameters, the chances of misestimation are lower. With the maximum slope, the values
and accuracy would primarily depend on the maximum slope of every TAC, which in the
case of secondary peaks, such as for the analytical bases, and not only for the AIF, would
contribute to the poor assessment of the perfusion parameters. Alternatively, gamma-variate
functions could be fitted to the AIF28 and to all the TACs, to smooth them out and leave
out noise. Not only should the large number of TACs be fitted, but also for each one, the
fitting parameters should be adjusted. This is particularly difficult because of the noise that
results in multiple peaks in the TAC. At first glance, the idea of fitting gamma variate to
also hypo-perfused area might seem good, but these regions are also affected by noise, and

even though the peaks in such fitted TACs would be expected to be very low, they could
still be wrong in the time domain and falsely represent perfusion.
The contrast agent flow is highly dependent on the anatomy of the subject being
scanned. This means that even for exactly the same contrast agent injection protocol, the
bases might need to be shifted in time. In this work, this was simulated in such a way that
the rdCBCTp had to be shifted in time. The quality of the perfusion maps did not suffer
from it even though all the projections acquired in the first 1.5 s were excluded, and for these
views only seven points could then be used for modelling. Within the real CBCT scan, it
was sufficient to simply exclude the mask sweeps. However, by excluding mask sweeps, the
baseline needed for the subtraction of static anatomical structures is lost, so the values pre-
sented in the perfusion maps are not true to nature. Considering the outflow of the contrast
agent and little to no presence in rest of the sweeps, instead of the last two sweeps, two mask
sweeps at the beginning could be acquired, without acquiring more than eight sweeps. The
time shift could already be estimated in the projection domain by fitting the bases to regions
consisting of mostly vessels and selecting the shift with lowest fitting error, which would be
very time-consuming. Alternatively, this could be done if the position of the AIF could be
assumed in projection domain, since the vessels are visible in contrast-enhanced projections.
The TST is not robust to motion and the motion correction step within it could only
be performed in projection domain before the fitting of the bases functions. For shallow
breathing29, the displacement vector could be formed based on the diaphragm position30.
Otherwise, the time-resolved volumes would need to be calculated and registered. The num-
ber of points used for TAC sampling for perfusion parameter calculation determines the
number of volumes for registration. Furthermore, the rigid registration is not sufficient to
compensate for the patient motion, breathing motion, and as a consequence of the breathing,
the motion inside the liver. Although breathing motion was not present in the data from this
study, motion correction would still be beneficial for motion in the intestines and for the mis-
alignment between the acquired views, due to the inconsistency between the corresponding
angles in forward and backward sweep.

Conclusion and Future Work
This research focused on the possibility of using CBCT for dynamic liver perfusion imaging.
Although no major advantage over straightforward reconstruction was found, it was shown
that the MBR utilising the TST with a set of prior knowledge basis functions extracted from
only two dynamic CT perfusion scans of two different animals can outperform the static
reconstruction for simulated dynamic CBCT perfusion scan. This means that a prior CT
scan of the patient may not be necessary. It has also been shown, for the first time, that MBR
with TST using prior knowledge works accurately for the real dynamic CBCT perfusion scan.
However, this has yet to be confirmed by adequately comparing the CBCT perfusion maps
to the CT ones, which requires registration of the CBCT and CT volumes. Moreover, the
ways in which the extraction of the bases can be improved by utilising anatomical knowledge
of the organ should be examined. Future work would first have to focus on the availability
of more CT datasets for extracting the bases set. However, it would not be possible to carry
out numerous animal experiments, and generating appropriate patient datasets, would be
even more challenging.
