Abstract
The logistic equation is ubiquitous in applied mathematics as a minimal
model of saturating growth. Here, we examine a generalisation of the
logistic model to fitness-structured populations, motivated by examples
that range from the ageing of individuals in a species to immune cell
exhaustion by cancerous tissue. Through exploration of a range of con-
crete examples and a general analysis of polynomial fitness functions, we
derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the dependence of the kinet-
ics on structure to result in closed, low-dimensional moment equations
that are exact. Further, we showcase how coarse-grained moment infor-
mation can be used to elucidate the details of structured dynamics,
with immediate potential for model selection and hypothesis testing.

1 Introduction
Structure is ubiquitous in biology, from the macroscale heterogeneity of human
populations down to the microscale, phenotypically structured cellular envi-
ronment. Accordingly, structured models are commonly used in mathematical

biology, especially those that take a discrete approach to stratification [Robert-
son et al., 2018]. For instance, age-structured models have been used to study
the spread of contagious diseases such as measles [Tudor, 1985], AIDS [Grif-
fiths et al., 2000] and COVID-19 [Ram and Schaposnik, 2021] among different
age groups, and to compare different strategies for disease control. At the cel-
lular scale, applications include the phenotype switching of tumour-associated
macrophages and the transitions of cells through the different phases of the
cell cycle [Eftimie and Barelle, 2021, Vittadello et al., 2019], along with the
dynamics of lipoprotein oxidation, macrophage efferocytosis and lipid load-
ing during early atherosclerosis [Cobbold et al., 2002, Ford et al., 2019b,a,
Chambers et al., 2023].
A feature common to all of these discretely structured models is marked
complexity. Typically, capturing structure in a discrete manner leads to a
model that involves large numbers of coupled differential equations, more than
might be practical to analyse in any detail without relying solely on numerical
exploration. It is somewhat remarkable, then, that at least two recent works
of this ilk were able to reduce their structured population models to low-
dimensional systems, amenable to pen-and-paper analysis [Chambers et al.,
2023, Ford et al., 2019b]. In particular, these reductions were exact moment
closures, in that the reduced system was written in terms of the moments
of the population and did not introduce any additional approximations. This
exactness is in stark contrast to many widespread techniques for simplifying
large, possibly infinite-dimensional systems, such as asymptotic methods and
approximate moment closures. In the former, one effectively takes the discrete-
to-continuum limit to yield what is often a coarse-grained partial differential
equation model [Chambers et al., 2023, Wattis et al., 2020], which is then
hoped to be more straightforward to simulate and analyse. In the latter, which
is more commonly employed in active matter and stochastic applications, exact
equations for the evolution of the moments of the system are formed and
then truncated at some order, leading to a reduced system that is closed by
explicitly relating high order moments to low order quantities [Saintillan and
Shelley, 2013, Cintra and Tucker, 1995, Feng et al., 1998, Chaubal and Leal,
1998, Kuehn, 2016, Gillespie, 2009]. Notably, no truncation was necessary in
the works of Chambers et al. and Ford et al..
The prevalence of approximate approaches for simplifying complex, highly
structured models serves to highlight the apparent scarcity of exact reduc-
tions. However, in general it is not clear how often one might expect to be
able to pursue an exact closure. Hence, in this article, we aim to explore and
establish just how remarkable it is that the works of Chambers et al. and Ford
et al. were able to identify exact moment closures in the systems that they
studied. More generally, we will seek out necessary and sufficient conditions
for exact closures of this type to exist in a system, though we will restrict
ourselves to a particular class of structure-capturing models that focus on a
single population. We postpone to future work consideration of more complex

situations involving either multiple, interacting structured populations [Heth-
cote, 1997] or populations that are structured by two or more variables [Kang
et al., 2020, Bernard et al., 2003, Restif et al., 2013], along with considerations
of the discrete-to-continuum limit.
Seeking simplicity and some associated notion of ubiquity, we will explore
population models that are generalisations of the classical logistic model of
growth [Murray, 2007], with the aim of laying the foundation for more elabo-
rate future studies. Accordingly, we hope to raise more questions than we will
answer. In section 2, we spend some time discussing how one might generalise
logistic growth to structured populations, followed by a number of introduc-
tory and informative examples in section 3. Motivated by observations and
explorations from these examples, we proceed to focus on our key question,
that of the existence of exact moment closures for discretely structured pop-
ulations, in section 4. In section 5, we illustrate example closures in simple
yet non-trivial systems, highlighting the form and utility of exact closures and
showcasing how the closure procedure can fail. Finally, we turn in section 6
to a surprising example of how studying structure can, even in populations
where structure is largely absent, allow us to distinguish potential mechanisms
of growth using only population-aggregated information.
2 Model formulation
2.1 The scalar logistic equation
For a population of size u, the canonical continuous-time formulation of logistic
growth can be stated somewhat generally as
du
dt = gu

1 −u
L

,
(1)
where g and L are positive parameters. Typically, g plays the role of a net
growth rate in a resource-rich environment, so that we might write g = r −d
for reproduction rate r and death rate d1. The parameter L often represents
the carrying capacity of the environment, the maximum population size that is
sustainable. Standard analysis of this equation, which is ubiquitous in under-
graduate courses in mathematical biology, readily concludes that u = L is
the unique stable steady state of the differential equation for g > 0 and it is
globally stable for non-negative initial conditions [Murray, 2007].
Though the above form of the logistic equation is concise, it will be
instructive to write eq. (1) in the following, less concise form:
du
dt =
ru
|{z}
reproduction
−du
|{z}
death
−(bu)u
| {z }
burden
.
(2)
1Here and throughout, we use the terms reproduction and death to refer to abstract processes
of adding to and removing from a population, rather than to their usual definitions in specific
biological contexts.

On discretely structured logistic models and their moments
In eq. (2) we have highlighted the different mechanisms that contribute to the
logistic model. Here, the term burden refers to the negative effects that the
population has on the ability of its environment to support the population
(such as the consumption of resources), with the scalar b weighting this effect
against the processes of reproduction and death, so that b = g/L in this
simplest case (where g = r−d > 0). In what follows, we incorporate these three
mechanisms into a simple, structured model of population growth, wherein
the population is stratified and there is nuance associated with distinguishing
the effects of reproduction, death, and environmental burden.
2.2 Structured populations
As a generalisation of the classical logistic model of the previous section, we
consider a population that is structured by some notion of fitness. In applica-
tions, fitness might refer to an individual’s age or to a more complex metric of
health or capability to acquire resources and reproduce, for instance; here, we
do not focus on any particular context. We structure our population discretely,
indexing compartments by j ∈{0, . . . , N}, where increasing j corresponds to
decreasing fitness. As such, one might view j as a measure of unfitness, though
we will often simply refer to it as fitness. We write uj for the subpopulation
with fitness j, so that u0 corresponds to individuals with the highest fitness
level.
Motivated by the original logistic model, it seems natural to pose a model
that is abstractly structured as
duj
dt =
Rj
|{z}
reproduction
−Dj
|{z}
death
−Bj
|{z}
burden
+
Jj
|{z}
net flux
,
(3)
where each undefined term is a rate that may depend on j and where net
flux refers to the net rate of increase of uj due to the movement of individu-
als between subpopulations. One might be tempted to specify the functional
forms of these effects by simply adding a general fitness dependence to the
corresponding terms in eq. (2). However, there is some ambiguity in taking
this apparently minimal step, even when seeking the simplest possible model
of growth and resource availability.
First, consider the process of reproduction. Whilst the mechanism by which
new individuals are added to a population might be clear in a given context,
here we will consider two plausible routes. In the first, we assume that division
is asymmetric and that the parent produces one offspring that is born perfectly
fit, independent of the fitness of their parent. In this case, reproduction from
any subpopulation uj contributes only to the fittest population u0.
This asymmetric growth mechanism is perhaps most natural for age-
structured populations, where new individuals have minimal age at the time
of reproduction. The second route is readily motivated by a simplified descrip-
tion of cellular growth: during mitotic division, cells produce genetic copies of
themselves, which we assume inherit all accumulated genetic damage. Cast in

the context of our general, structured model, this idealised, symmetric mech-
anism of reproduction in subpopulation uj leads to an increase in that same
subpopulation. We seek to include contributions from both mechanisms in our
model and, therefore, introduce reproduction rates per capita r and ρ that cap-
ture reproduction into the healthy and current subpopulations, respectively.
As the former mechanism effectively resets the fitness of the offspring whilst
the latter preserves it, we will occasionally refer to these distinct mechanisms
as regenerative reproduction and clonal reproduction, respectively.
In practice, the reproductive rate in a population might be strongly linked
to fitness. This is often the case when fitness is linked to age in mammalian
populations. Therefore, we also incorporate a general fitness dependence into
the reproductive rates. Explicitly, we take r = r(j) and ρ = ρ(j) to be func-
tions of fitness and, to avoid ambiguity, we assume that ρ(0) = 0, so that r(0)
represents the sole rate of reproduction in the healthy population. With this
notation and these assumptions, the reproduction term in eq. (3) takes the
form
Rj =
(PN
i=0 r(i)ui
if j = 0 ,
ρ(j)uj
if j > 0 .
(4)
The second term in eq. (3) is not associated with the same nuance as the
reproduction rate, with a linear death rate being a plausible candidate in a
minimal model. Hence, taking d(j) to be the fitness-dependent death rate per
capita of the jth subpopulation for some function of fitness d, we take
Dj = d(j)uj
(5)
in eq. (3).
For the term that encodes the self-limiting effects of the population, Bj, we
again adopt the principles that underpin the scalar logistic growth equation,
and posit that Bj depends on the overall burden of the whole population
on the environment. As such, Bj should inherit a dependence on the whole
population, not simply uj, with the nuance that subpopulations with different
fitnesses might contribute differently to the overall burden. For instance, an
injured animal may consume fewer resources in its environment and, thereby,
be associated with a lower burden or resource cost. Hence, we write the overall
burden of the population as the sum P
i b(i)ui for a fitness-dependent burden
function b, where the sum is taken over all indices i ∈{0, . . . , N}. Further, it
is plausible that different subpopulations may be differently affected by this
burden on the environment. Hence, we scale the effect on subpopulation uj
by a factor e(j), where e is an as-yet-unspecified function of fitness. Thus, in
total, the burden term Bj can be written somewhat generally as
Bj = e(j)
N
X
i=0
[b(i)ui] uj .
(6)

On discretely structured logistic models and their moments
Finally, we consider the net flux term Jj, which represents changes in fit-
ness and, therefore, movement between compartments. Whilst there are many
functional forms that Jj might plausibly take, here we consider fluxes that
depend linearly on the population and, hence, adopt the minimal form
Jj = w(j −1)uj−1 −w(j)uj
(7)
for j ∈{0, . . . , N −1}, where w is a fitness-dependent function that encodes
the rate of transfer between subpopulations and is necessarily non-negative
for all j ∈{0, . . . , N −1}. We extend this definition to j = −1 and j = N by
defining w(−1) = w(N) = 0, which removes any dependence on the fictitious
u−1 and prevents flux out of the discrete fitness domain, so that P
j Jj = 0.
The simple forms adopted here enable the fitness of the population to
decline over time, with individuals moving in the direction of increasing j,
but they do not allow for recovery, which corresponds to movement in the
direction of reducing j. Whilst this might seem like a significant and restrictive
assumption, the analysis that we later pursue can be readily extended to
cases where this flux is bi-directional, though at the expense of the marked
brevity that uni-directional flux affords. Hence, we focus only on the declining
populations modelled by eq. (7), although we revisit bi-directional fluxes in
appendix A.
In summary, our general model can be stated as
duj
dt = n(j, u)uj + Jj + δ0j
X
i
r(i)ui ,
(8)
where δ0j is the Kronecker delta and all summations without explicit limits
shall henceforth be assumed to run over {0, . . . , N}. We have grouped the
effects of clonal reproduction, death, and the environmental burden into a
single term
n(j, u) = ρ(j) −d(j) −e(j)
X
i
b(i)ui
(9)
for notational convenience, writing u for the collection of all subpopulations
and recalling that ρ(0) = 0. We note that the characteristic non-linearity of
logistic growth models is present in the term n(j, u)uj, which includes all
products of the form uiuj though always through the summation P
i b(i)uiuj.
Additionally, we assume that each of the functions r, ρ, d, e, b takes non-
negative values on j ∈{0, . . . , N}, so that the terms in eq. (3) retain
their intended physical interpretation, though the analysis that follows is not
sensitive to this assumption.
3 Structured examples
Before we analyse the general model formulated above, it is informative to
examine the consequences of structure via a number of example systems of

varying complexity. These examples highlight how even simple population
structures can lead to qualitative differences in overall dynamics, along with
complicating pen-and-paper analysis.
3.1 Fitness-independent kinetics
First, we consider one of the simplest reductions of eq. (8), in which r = 0,
ρ −d = ˆg, e = ˆg/ˆL, and b = 1, where ˆg and ˆL are non-negative constants that
are analogous to the growth rate and carrying capacity of the scalar logistic
equation of eq. (1). Put differently, this is a model in which structure plays
no role in the growth kinetics. With these assumptions, the structured model
becomes
duj
dt = ˆguj
 
1 −1
ˆL
X
i
ui
!
+ Jj ,
(10)
which closely resembles the structure that we sought to generalise from the
scalar logistic model of eq. (1), with the addition of an as-yet-unspecified
flux between subpopulations. Here, in search of a direct analogue of the
scalar model, we have chosen to include only clonal reproduction, though
regenerative reproduction will play a role in our later analysis.
Even before specifying Jj, we can make substantial analytical progress
towards capturing the overall dynamics of this class of structured model, espe-
cially if we are only concerned with the total population. Indeed, summing
eq. (10) over j and defining µ0 = P
j uj yields the evolution equation
dµ0
dt = ˆgµ0

1 −µ0
ˆL

,
(11)
recalling that P
j Jj = 0 and noting that the term P
i ui = µ0 in eq. (10)
is independent of j. This evolution equation is precisely the scalar logistic
equation of eq. (1). Thus, the overall population size of any structured popu-
lation described by eq. (10) is governed by an unstructured logistic equation,
independent of the choice of Jj. This result is not unexpected, as the growth
kinetics in this small class of models are independent of the fitness of the
subpopulations, so that moving between subpopulations has no effect on the
population’s overall growth dynamics. A key aspect of our general model
formulation that allowed its reduction to a scalar logistic equation was the
assumption that the burden term for subpopulation j in eq. (6) is explic-
itly dependent on all subpopulations, rather than just the jth subpopulation.
Indeed, if one were to pose the evolution equation for uj with a burden that
only depends on uj, such a reduction would not be possible in general.
In fig. 1, we illustrate the dynamics of two such models: Model A, with
w(j) = (N −j)/W, and Model B, with w(j) = 1, where j = 0, . . . , N −1.
The model dynamics are shown in panels (a) and (b), respectively, where
W = (N + 1)/2 fixes the average flux rate to be unity in the first model.

Fig. 1 The dynamics of two, simple structured populations which differ in their relations
between fitness and flux rate. We plot the evolution of the fitness-structured models A and
B of section 3.1 in (a) and (b), respectively. In each panel, the size of the overall population
is shown as a heavy black curve, whilst the dynamics of individual subpopulations are shown
as lighter, coloured curves, with fitness indicated by colour. The dynamics of the total
populations in each case are identical and logistic in character, as expected given eq. (11),
whilst the dynamics of the subpopulations differ significantly between the cases. Here, we
have enforced w(−1) = 0 = w(N) and taken N = 10, ˆg = 1, and ˆL = 2, with an initial
population of unit size in the healthy compartment (j = 0).
Expectedly, both models give rise to the same overall dynamics (heavy black
curves), but the dynamics of their subpopulations are markedly different (thin
coloured curves). In particular, fig. 1a highlights that Model A, with non-
constant flux rates, prolongs the existence of subpopulations with intermediate
fitness, commensurate with the associated decreasing flux rate. In each exam-
ple, we have fixed N = 10, ˆg = 1, and ˆL = 2, and begun the realisation with
an initially healthy population u0 = 1 at t = 0.
3.2 Fitness-dependent models
The simple, reduced dynamics exhibited by the previous models are far from
the norm in structured population models. To illustrate this, we now consider
a population with an increasing death rate d(j) = j, a decreasing flux w(j) =
N −j, a constant birth rate β, and no environmental burden, so that e(j) = 0.
This leads to the system
duj
dt = (β −j)uj + Jj ,
(12)
which is exponential in character due to the lack of quadratic terms in uj.
Nevertheless, it demonstrates the complexity of structured models. Illustrative
dynamics of this model are shown in fig. 2a, exemplifying a case in which
the flux rate is initially larger than the population growth rate, with β =
(N + 1)/2, w(j) = N −j, and N = 10. This leads to a population that,
despite an initial period of exponential growth, eventually collapses as the
population’s fitness declines and its death rate increases. In particular, the
healthiest compartments (those with small j) transfer rapidly into less healthy
subpopulations and subsequently experience an increased death rate.
As a second, truly logistic example, we include fitness dependence in both
of the burden-related terms, taking b(j) = j and e(j) = 1 + (N −j)/N.
This describes a population that imposes a greater burden as their fitness

declines (as j increases), although they also become less impacted by the
overall burden. To accompany this, we include a decreasing clonal growth
rate ρ(j) = 2(N −j)2/N, with the least fit subpopulation being unable to
reproduce. These assumptions lead to the more complex system

(13)
The dynamics of this system with w(j) = N −j and N = 10 are shown
in fig. 2b, highlighting non-monotonic evolution towards a non-zero steady
configuration. The population structure in this steady state is shown inset,
highlighting that much of the population is concentrated in subpopulations of
intermediate fitness. This is commensurate with the vanishing growth rate of
the j = N subpopulation and the rapid growth, but similarly rapid flux, of
the j = 0 subpopulation.
As the non-monotonic dynamics of the total populations in fig. 2 are not
compatible with the monotonic solutions of the classical logistic equation, we
should not expect to be able to recover such a simple model for the total
population in either of these more complex cases. Focussing on the exponential
model of eq. (12) and seeking an aggregated description, by summing over j
as before, now leads to the total population equation
dµ0
dt = βµ0 −
X

juj .
(14)
As expected, this did not eliminate the explicit dependence on each of the uj,
with the term P
j juj remaining due to the dependence of the kinetics on the
fitness of the subpopulation. However, the simple form of the remaining sum-
mation suggests that we seek an explicit equation for its evolution. Denoting
this term by µ1 for brevity, the dynamics of the weighted sum can be found

(15)
Once again, this aggregated evolution equation contains terms that we have
not yet accounted for. The pre-multiplication by j before summation results in
the presence of quadratic terms that cannot in general be written in terms of
µ0 and µ1, whilst the details of the currently unspecified flux Jj now enter into
the dynamics. Without further knowledge of both the flux and the quadratic
terms, further progress is not possible. In particular, whilst one might consider
multiplying eq. (12) by j2 instead of j in an attempt to close the system, this
simply generates additional unknown terms and does not result in a closed
system in general. The lack of obvious closure of the aggregated system is in
stark contrast to the models of section 3.1, in which closure was immediate.
At this point, it is not clear if eqs. (14) and (15) can ever constitute a closed
system, though it is plausible that some choices of the flux terms Jj will lead
to the necessary cancellation of terms in eq. (15). In the next section, through
a more general analysis of eq. (8), we will seek to determine conditions that
lead to closure of these aggregated equations. As a consequence, we will in
fact show that closure of this model is unattainable.
4 Exact moment closure for polynomial fitness
dependence
Hereafter, we consider the general model defined by eq. (8). Generalising the
approach and notation of the example of the previous section, we define the
kth order moment of the population as
µk =
X
j
jkuj
(16)
for integer k ≥0. Thus, µ0 = P
j uj gives the total population, µ1 = P
j juj
is the fitness-weighted average seen in section 3.2, and µ2 is related to (but
does not generally equal) the variance of the fitness.
With this definition, and motivated by section 3.2, we seek to determine
conditions under which the moments µ0, µ1, . . . , µK form a closed description
of the dynamics. We will refer to such a K ≤N as the order of a closure,
noting that a system may admit closures at multiple orders.
To make progress, we will assume that the parameters that control repro-
duction, the intrinsic death rate, the effect of the burden, and the flux are
all polynomial functions of fitness. In terms of the notation of section 2, this
implies that r, ρ, d, e, and w are polynomials in j. As a result, the aggregated
term n is also a polynomial in j, noting that P
i biui is independent of j and
that it can be absorbed into the coefficients of the polynomial. Explicitly, we

n(j) =
deg (n)
X
α=0
ναjα
and
w(j) =
deg (w)
X
β=0
ωβjβ ,
(17)
with the coefficients να and ωβ of these polynomials being denoted by Greek
characters with Greek subscripts. Here, deg (·) refers to the polynomial degree,
so that νdeg (n) and ωdeg (w) are necessarily non-zero unless n or w are identi-
cally zero. We note also that the degree of n is bounded above by the maximum
of the degrees of ρ, d, and e. Here and throughout, any dependence of n on u
is implicit.
4.1 The trivial closure
Before analysing the general case, it is worth highlighting that one can always
find closed systems of moments for finite N. To see this, we note that the
moments are simply linear combinations of the uj, with coefficients jk for
integer k. Thus, the moments and subpopulations are related via
V T u = µN ,
(18)
where µN is the vector of moments of order at most N and V is the (N +1)×
(N + 1) Vandermonde matrix with entries Vαβ = αβ for zero-based indices
α, β ∈{0, . . . , N}. It is a standard result of linear algebra that such a matrix is
invertible. Hence, we may write each uj as a linear combination of µ0, . . . , µN
and, therefore, the same is true of all moments of order greater than N. Thus,
we can always close a system at order N, which we will refer to as the trivial
closure. As this closure in general offers no reduction in complexity over the
original system of equations, we will henceforth restrict our interest to closures
of order K < N, and will neglect the trivial closure in our subsequent analysis.
Moreover, we will seek closures in which K is independent of N.
4.2 Essentially unstructured systems
Consider a population in which within-subpopulation effects n, burden coef-
ficients b, and regenerative growth r rates are each independent of fitness,
so that the kinetics are independent of the structure of the population. This
can also be interpreted as a population whose governing equations, excluding
any flux terms, are invariant under all reparameterisations of the fitness j, a
concrete example of this being the simple systems explored in section 3.1. As
we saw in section 3, these essentially unstructured systems can be reduced to
closed scalar equations for the total population by exploiting the conservative
nature of the flux, recalling that P
j Jj = 0 for any suitable definition of Jj.
Hence, these systems can be closed at zeroth order without any additional

constraints and always lead to dynamics of the form
dµ0
dt = [n(µ0) + r] µ0 ,
(19)
noting that the dependence of n on u reduces precisely to a dependence on
µ0 when b is constant, whilst P
i r(i)ui = rµ0 when r(i) ≡r is constant.
Despite this trivial closure at zeroth order, it is not obvious if any higher
order moments can be captured quite so simply. Multiplying the evolution
equation for uj by jk and summing over the subpopulations leads to

bution from regenerative growth in this evolution equation, as its contribution
to the sum is weighted by fitness j = 0. Significantly, the sum P
j jkJj does
not vanish in general for k > 0, with this sum plausibly dependent on any of
the higher order moments, so that the system need not be closed at order k.
Hence, though we are always able to capture the evolution of the total pop-
ulation via a simple logistic equation, in general we are not able to capture
finer details of the population with the same ease.
However, if Jj were such that we could write P
j jkJj in terms of the
moments µ0, µ1, . . . , µK for every k = 1, . . . , K, then this system would indeed
be closed, with eq. (20) depending on only moments of order K or less. To
explore whether this is possible, we insert the definition of Jj from eq. (7) into
the sum for general k to give

with sums running over j = 0, . . . , N. Recalling that w(−1) = w(N) = 0, we
are free to shift the index in the first summation without introducing additional
terms, yielding

valid for all admissible w(j). As a polynomial in j, the leading order term in
(j + 1)k −jk is simply kjk−1. Hence, recalling that w(j) is a polynomial in j
for j ∈{0, . . . , N}, the leading order term inside the summation is precisely
kωdeg (w)jk−1+deg (w), the product of kjk−1 and the leading order term of w(j).
Notably, this term vanishes for k = 0, independent on the degree of w and
in line with the closure at order K = k = 0 seen in these systems. However, this
term is non-vanishing for all k > 0, so that the contribution of the flux term to
the evolution equation for µk contains a non-trivial dependence on jk−1+deg (w)
and, hence, on µk−1+deg (w). Thus, the system of moment equations is closed
at order k only if deg (w) ≤1 i.e. if the flux rate w(j) is constant or is linear

in the fitness. Somewhat remarkably, this condition is independent of k, so
that one can find closed equations for moments of any degree in an essentially
unstructured system with deg (w) ≤1. More precisely, recalling that w is a
non-negative polynomial and that w(N) = 0, this class of w is equivalent
to non-negative scalar multiples of N −j. In other words, closed moment
equations for such systems can be found if and only if w ≡C(N −j) for any
C ≥0.
4.3 General closure conditions
In essentially unstructured systems, we have seen that closure is immediate
at zeroth order, and that we can sometimes obtain closed systems for higher
order moments. For other systems, however, this zeroth-order closure need not
occur, as we saw in the example of section 3.2. In this section, we build upon
our analysis of essentially unstructured systems and explore systems that lack
such simple closures.
Before we proceed, it is important to note that we can immediately place
a lower bound on the order K of any closure, which arises due to the form
of the burden and regenerative growth terms. In particular, as b is a polyno-
mial in j, the burden term P
i biui is necessarily dependent on µdeg (b) and
potentially lower order moments. Analogously, the regenerative growth term
depends on µdeg (r). Hence, these moments appear explicitly in the dynam-
ics for each subpopulation and any closure must, therefore, include both
µdeg (b) and µdeg (r). Thus, the order K of any closure necessarily satisfies
K ≥max{deg (b), deg (r)}. Notably, this bound was trivially satisfied in our
examples of essentially unstructured systems, since deg (b) = deg (r) = 0 in
both cases.
For the remainder of this study, we shall omit mention of these somewhat
trivial lower bounds, as they do not impact consequentially on our analysis. As
such, we will leave implicit any dependence of n(j) on these moments, noting
that they only appear as coefficients in the polynomial form of n and do not
otherwise complicate matters. Naturally, however, these bounds must be taken
into consideration in any application of these results to a particular system.
To proceed, we return to the general form of the subpopulation dynamics
given in eq. (8):

j Jj = 0. With n(j) and r(j) polynomials in j, this evolution
equation can be written in terms of the moments µ0, . . . , µm, where m =
max{deg (n), deg (r)}. Hence, for non-constant n or r, the dynamics of the

population are not closed at zeroth order and, therefore, we must proceed to
higher order moments.
Seeking the dynamics of µk for k ∈Z+, we multiply eq. (23) by jk and sum,
analogously to the special case of section 4.2. In this general case, we obtain

(28)
for γ1 ∈{0, . . . , deg (w)} and γ2 ∈{0, . . . , k −1}. For instance, we have
ϕk,0 = ω0 and ϕk,k−1+deg (w) = kωdeg (w), whilst ϕ1,i = ωi for all i. Hence, the
governing equation for the kth moment can be written explicitly as

with powers of j in p(j) giving rise to the corresponding moment after
summation.
This explicit form reveals an expected complication: if the growth kinetics
depend on fitness, so that deg (n) > 0, the evolution equation for µk contains
a dependence on µk+1, . . . , µk+deg (n). An analogous property emerges from
the flux terms: unless their dependence on fitness is linear or trivial, they
contribute moments µk+1, . . . , µk−1+deg (w). Thus, the only way for closure to
Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template
On discretely structured logistic models and their moments
15
be possible at order K = k is if the contributions of these terms precisely
cancel out for all moments of order greater than k. In particular, this must be
true for the highest order moments, so that
νdeg (n)µK+deg (n) + Kωdeg (w)µK−1+deg (w) ≡0 .
(30)
As the moments are linearly independent (see section 4.1) and the leading
order coefficients of the polynomials are non-zero by definition, this equality
can only hold if the moments are in fact the same and their coefficients sum
to zero. In symbols, this imposes the degree constraint
deg (n) = deg (w) −1
(31)
along with a coefficient constraint
νdeg (n) + Kωdeg (w) = 0 .
(32)
Remarkably, eq. (31) is independent of K and is therefore necessary for closure
at any order. In other words, closure is only possible if the polynomial degree
of the flux rate is one more than the degree of the kinetic terms; otherwise,
closure is not achievable.
Assuming that this degree condition is satisfied, the complete set of con-
ditions on the coefficients needed to eliminate any explicit dependence on
moments µK+1, . . . , µK+deg (n) may be simply stated as
να + ϕK,K+α = 0
(33)
for α ∈{1, . . . , deg (n)}, a linear system of equations relating the growth
kinetics to the transport. Note that the number of conditions depends only
on deg (n) = deg (w) −1 and not on the order of the closure. However, the
conditions themselves depend on K, so that closure at different orders imposes
different constraints on the forms of n and w. Therefore, a system that is
closed at order K should not in general be expected to be closed at any other
order, as this additionally requires ϕK,K+α = ϕl,l+α for some l ̸= K and all α.
This observation proves to be restrictive beyond just the uniqueness of K
for a given system. At this point, it may appear that closure is always possible
for any given n: the degree of n fixes the degree of w, whose coefficients we then
partly specify by solving a system of the form of eq. (33). However, we note
that these conditions arise only as the result of requiring that the evolution
equation for the Kth moment does not contain higher order moments, and
provide no such guarantees for the other evolution equations.
To see the impact of this, note that in the absence of a flux term the
moment µk+deg (n) will appear in the evolution equation for µk. For k = K, the
above conditions guarantee that introducing an appropriate flux will eliminate
this term and other moments of order larger than K, so that the system
appears closed at order K. If deg (n) = 1, then the system truly is closed: the
Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template
16
On discretely structured logistic models and their moments
evolution of µk will depend on µk+1 for k < K, but the system closes overall
as the evolution of µ(K−1)+1 = µK depends only on lower order moments.
Hence, the conditions established above are both necessary and sufficient for
closure when deg (n) = 1.
However, for deg (n) > 1, the provided conditions are not sufficient, as
the evolution equation for µK−1 will depend on µK−1+deg (n) ̸∈{µ0, . . . , µK}
and need not be cancelled out by a corresponding flux term. In fact, such
cancellation can never occur. To see this, note that we necessarily have
dµK−1
dt
=

νdeg (n) + ϕK−1,K−1+deg (n)

µK−1+deg (n) + · · ·
(34)
where terms of lower degree have been omitted. Moreover, ϕK−1,K−1+deg (n) =
(K−1)ωdeg (w) from eq. (28), so that the dependence on µK−1+deg (N) vanishes
if and only if
νdeg (n) + (K −1)ωdeg (w) = 0 .
(35)
However, eq. (32) already fixes the leading coefficient ωdeg (w) of w, so that
closure in fact requires
νdeg (n) = 0 ,
(36)
a contradiction as νdeg (n) is nonzero by definition. Hence, closure is not pos-
sible if deg (n) > 1, irrespective of the choice of flux or the precise form of
the growth dynamics. We will illustrate this failure in the final example of
section 5.
In summary, we have shown that structured logistic systems with growth
kinetics that are linear in the fitness j can be closed exactly at any order K
by constraining the flux term via eqs. (31) and (32). In section 5.2, we will
present an example that explicitly gives the general form of admissible fluxes.
For all other growth dynamics, i.e. those with explicit nonlinear dependence
on the fitness j, we have shown that non-trivial moment closure of this form
is impossible.
5 Example closures
In this section, we present examples of closures in essentially unstructured and
structured populations, along with an example in which closure is not possible
due to nonlinear growth kinetics.
5.1 Essentially unstructured systems
Both of the examples considered in section 3.1 are essentially unstructured.
Indeed, Model A has a flux rate that is precisely of the form w ≡C(N−j), with
C = 1/W. Computing the evolution equations for the first- and second-order
moments yields

Fig. 3 The evolving moments of Model A. (a) Using the same parameters and initial
conditions as fig. 1, we plot the evolution of the lowest order moments corresponding to
Model A, an essentially unstructured system that admits closures at every order. Moments
have been rescaled by powers of N for visual clarity. In (b), we plot the phase portrait of the
dynamics in the µ0-µ1 plane, scaling µ1 by N. As the system closes at this order, the phase
diagram completely captures the evolution of the lowest moments. The particular case shown
in (a) is plotted here as a thick black curve, with the population growing quickly overall
and then being transported to subpopulations with larger j. The upper, shaded region is
infeasible, bounded by µ1 = Nµ0, and the black disc is the unique stable steady state.

As expected, these constitute a closed system of moment equations for
{µ0, µ1, µ2} when combined with eq. (11), along with the closed subsystems
{µ0, µ1} and even {µ0}. Hence, we have explicit closures at orders K ∈{0, 1, 2}
for this system, and the above analysis predicts similar closures for all K. We
illustrate the evolution of the first three moments in fig. 3a, along with a phase
portrait of the closed dynamics of µ0 and µ1 in fig. 3b.
Model B of section 3.1, however, is qualitatively different: as the flux rate is
constant and nonzero for j ̸= N, any polynomial representation is of degree at
least N. Hence, even the evolution equation governing its first-order moment
µ1 will contain a dependence on a moment of order N or higher, so that
the only possible closure is the trivial closure of section 4.1. Thus, perhaps
surprisingly, apparent simplicity is not sufficient to yield low-order closures in
structured growth models.
5.2 Structured systems
We now illustrate the general results formulated in section 4.3 by returning
to the two structured examples of section 3.2, which do not close at zeroth
order. Rather than analyse a model with a specified flux rate w, we will instead
determine the flux rates that are compatible with closure of these models at
various orders.

5.2.1 Structured exponential growth
We begin with the exponential model of eq. (12), illustrated in fig. 2a, whose
dynamics we recount as
duj
dt = (β −j)uj + Jj .
(39)
Here, we have n(j) = β −j and r(j) = 0, so that any closures must be of order
K ≥deg (n) = 1. As deg (n) = 1, the analysis of section 4.3 guarantees that
closure is possible, and specifies deg (w) = deg (n) + 1 = 2, so that the only
fluxes that permit closures are (at most) quadratic in the fitness variable, j.
The coefficients of w are then determined (in part) by eq. (32), which in this
case reduces to
ω2 = −ν1
K = 1
K ,
(40)
as ν1 = −1 and ϕK,K+1 = Kω2. Hence, as the conditions of section 4.3 are
necessary and sufficient for closure when deg (n) = 1, this system can be closed
for any flux rate of the form
w(j) = 1
K j2 + ω1j + ω0 .
(41)
Recalling that w(N) = 0 and w(j) ≥0 for j ∈{0, . . . , N}, the admissible
fluxes reduce to a one-parameter family of polynomials of the form
w(j) = 1
K (j −N)(j −C)
(42)
for all C ≥N. More generally, linear growth kinetics may be closed by fluxes
of the form
w(j) = ν1
K (j −N)(C −j) ,
(43)
where C ≥N if ν1 < 0 and C ≤0 if ν1 > 0, recalling that w(j) ≥0
for admissible j. Somewhat curiously, the leading factor of 1/K implies that
closure at higher orders requires reduced fluxes.
As validation of our closure-predicting analysis, we explicitly compute the
closure at order K = 1, giving

dµ1
dt = CNµ0 + (β −C −N)µ1 ,

noting that the µ2-term generated by n in the equation for µ1 has been pre-
cisely cancelled out by the flux, as expected. This system, whose dimension
and complexity is independent of N, is simple to study. The extinction state
(µ0, µ1) = (0, 0) is linearly stable if and only if β < N, and gives way to a
marginally stable continuum of fixed points for β = N. Larger β correspond

ing to a continuum of marginally stable steady states on the curve µ1 = Nµ0. Here, N = 10

to rapid exponential growth with no admissible non-zero steady states. Two
phase portraits are shown in fig. 4, with β < N in fig. 4a and β = N in fig. 4b,
with the latter highlighting the continuum of steady states with µ1 = Nµ0
when β = N.
Before we move on to a final example, it is worth noting that care should be
taken when studying the closed system of moments, as they may capture more
behaviours than are admissible in the full structured model. For instance, at
first glance, nothing appears to prohibit the system evolving to the physically
infeasible case of µ0 = 0 whilst µ1 > 0. This is, in fact, a special case of
the general class of physically unrealistic states characterised by µ1 > Nµ0.
However, it turns out that the derived system of moments does respect this
constraint: if µ1 = Nµ0, then dµ1/dt = Ndµ0/dt, so that a trajectory initially
satisfying µ1 ≤Nµ0 will do so for all time. Hence, feasible states remain
feasible for all time. This compatibility condition, along with the analogous
constraints for higher order moments, will be present in all derived moment
equations and serves as a simple way of verifying the correctness of computed
closures. We can see examples of this in figs. 3 and 4, where the shaded regions
are infeasible and unreachable.
5.2.2 Nonlinear fitness dependence
As a final example, we now seek closures of the most complex model of
section 3.2, defined by eq. (13). The dynamics of each subpopulation depend
explicitly on the first moment µ1, so that any closures must be at least of
order 1, with

(45)
We do not expect to be able to close this system, as deg (n) = 2. In particular,
we expect to be unable to simultaneously eliminate higher order moments
from the evolution equations of µK−1 and µK for any K.
To verify this result, we now seek a closure of order K = 2. We impose the
degree and coefficient constraints of eqs. (31) and (33), so that deg (w) = 3

(47)
where ω1 and ω0 are yet to be determined. This flux rate depends explicitly on
the moment µ1, a feature that has been inherited from the growth dynamics
that will not prove problematic. Imposing w(N) = 0 then reduces this to a one-
dimensional family of admissible fluxes, further constrained by the requirement
that w(j) ≥0 for j ∈{0, . . . , N −1}, though we omit these details here for
brevity.
The imposed conditions are necessary and sufficient for removing higher
order moments from the evolution equation for µ2. To verify this, we compute
the time evolution of moments µ0, µ1, and µ2 as

We note that, as expected, the evolution of µ2 depends only on µ0, µ1, and
µ2. However, the evolution of µ1 irreparably depends on µ3, with coefficient
ν2 + ω3 ̸= 0. Hence, we verify that exact moment closure is unattainable at
order 2 in this system, driven by the nonlinear dependence of the growth
kinetics on fitness. More generally, the coefficient of µK+1 in the evolution
equation for µK−1 will be ν2/K ̸= 0, so that closure is impossible at all orders
in this system. Notably, this approaches zero for large K, so one might expect
in future work to find that approximate closures of reasonable accuracy can
be found at high order when deg (n) = 2.
6 Identifying mechanism in essentially
unstructured systems
To conclude, we highlight the utility of structured population models for
investigating the mechanisms underlying population growth. In section 2,
specifically eq. (4), we noted the existence of two plausible mechanisms of
Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template
On discretely structured logistic models and their moments
21
growth in structured populations: clonal growth (offspring have equal fitness
to their parent) and regenerative growth (offspring are maximally fit). In any
given experimental system, it may not be clear which of these mechanisms
is at play. However, if we restrict ourselves to essentially unstructured sys-
tems, where one might think that modelling structure is superfluous, we will
show that structured models can allow us to distinguish between these two
mechanisms using only population-level information.
Consider two essentially unstructured populations that can be modelled
via eq. (8) with the restrictions of section 4.2. Informed by the analysis of that
section, we take w(j) to be linear in j, so that the system of moments closes
at all orders. Their evolution can be summarised as

(49)
where here ρ, r, d and e are constant rates of growth or death and we have
grouped together all the terms unrelated to reproduction into a single term Lj.
Notably, by the above constraints on w(j), we have that P
j Lj = −(d+eµ0)µ0
and that P
j jLj = f(µ0, µ1) is a function of µ0 and µ1 only.
Suppose that the two populations of interest are identical save for their
mechanism of growth: one performs only clonal growth, whilst the other per-
forms only regenerative growth. Hence, writing uC
j
and uR

for the clonal
and regenerative populations, respectively, they satisfy the following evolution
equations:

Here and throughout, superscripts of C and R correspond to clonal and regen-
erative analogues, respectively. Note that, in order for only the mechanism
(rather than the rate) of growth to differ between populations, we must have
ρ = r.
Together, these constraints have a practically unfortunate, if unsurprising,
consequence: were we to measure the total size of each population, the two
would be indistinguishable. This is apparent when summing eq. (50) over j to
yield evolution equations for µC

where ρ = r ensures that both populations will evolve in the same way from
equal initial conditions.
Thus far, it looks like structure has afforded little other than nota-
tional complexity. However, computing the evolution equation for the first

where the terms involving f arise from summing jLj. From the form of these
equations, we see that only clonal reproduction has a direct and immediate
impact on the evolution of the first moment of fitness. In contrast, whilst
regenerative reproduction naturally impacts the whole dynamics, its effects
are only via the eventual evolution µ0 and µ1. Concretely, given equal starting
conditions, the initial rate of change of µC
1 depends strongly on ρ = r, whilst
the initial evolution of µR
1 is independent of the growth rate.
This is exemplified in fig. 5, where we compare the evolution of two such
populations and their response to a change in growth rate. In fig. 5a,b we plot
the evolution of a clonal and regenerative population, respectively, with the
scaled first moments µC
1 /N and µR
1 /N shown dashed. Notably, though the first
moments are different, the evolution of the total population is the same in each
case. When changing the growth rate of both populations (panels c and d), we
note that the evolution of µC
1 (shown dashed in fig. 5c) is drastically impacted
by the parameter change, with its gradient even switching sign, whilst the
evolution of µR
1 in fig. 5d appears insensitive to the change in parameter, at
least at short times.
Overall, this highlights that, were one able to modify the growth rate in
a controlled system, measurements of only µ1 would allow for the identifica-
tion of the mechanism of growth, whilst measuring only µ0 (which may seem
more natural) would not. In particular, an observation of µ1 being sensitive to
the change in growth rate would signify the presence of clonal growth, whilst
insensitivity during initial evolution would suggest regenerative growth. Thus,
even in essentially unstructured systems, modelling and measuring what lit-
tle structure is present can illuminate otherwise unidentifiable details of the
dynamics.
7 Summary and Discussion
In this introductory article, we have explored the dynamics of structured popu-
lations that can be described by generalisations of the classical logistic model of
growth. Perhaps surprisingly, even generalising the principles of logistic growth
led to some ambiguity in the mechanism of reproduction: is the structure vari-
able (which here we thought of as fitness) preserved during reproduction, or

Fig. 5 The dynamics of four essentially unstructured models, highlighting the information
that structure can provide even in seemingly unstructured systems. In (a) and (b) we plot the
evolution of populations uC and uR, which grow via clonal and regenerative reproduction,
respectively, with equal parameters. The different mechanisms of growth lead to different
first moments µC
1 and µR
1 (shown dashed) but equal total populations (solid black curves).
In (c) and (d) we reduce the growth rate by 60% from (a) and (b), leading to a reduction in
overall population size. Notably, the evolution of µC
1 is markedly different to that in (a). In
contrast, the initial evolution of µR
1 remains approximately unchanged between (b) and (d),
distinguishing regenerative growth from clonal growth through their first moments. Here,
we have taken N = 10, g = 1, w(j) = (N −j)/10 and K = 2, with ρ = r = 1 in (a) and (b).
is it changed in the process? Here we considered just two possibilities, either
preserving or resetting the fitness of newly spawned population, and found in
section 6 that the study of moment closures can distinguish these two mech-
anisms in simply structured populations using aggregated information alone.
In future, a more complete investigation into the possible effects of reproduc-
tion on the structure variable is warranted, especially given the prospect of
using population-level information to discern details of mechanism.
A key focus of this study has been seeking out conditions for exact moment
closures, which we demonstrated to be very restrictive. Though the relative
rarity of closures may not be too surprising, it does highlight how remarkable
it is that closures have been found in previous works [Chambers et al., 2023,
Ford et al., 2019b], especially as these systems do not appear to have been con-
trived with the intent of generating exact closures. More generally, considering
systems where exact closures are not realisable, it is not clear how signifi-
cant the errors associated with slightly violating the derived closure conditions
(e.g. by perturbing a coefficient constraint) might be. This prompts the future
pursuit of systematically constructing approximate moment closures, perhaps
drawing on the wealth of literature in the active matter and stochastic systems
communities [Saintillan and Shelley, 2013, Cintra and Tucker, 1995, Kuehn,
2016, Gillespie, 2009], for instance. The existing progress in these other fields
also motivates a future study of the impacts of taking the continuum limit

(N →∞) of the discretely structured systems that we’ve explored in this
work. A priori, it is not clear if the conclusions reached in this study will carry
over to the continuum limit. Indeed, with reference to the continuum limit
obtained in Chambers et al. [2023], we expect there to be significant nuance
in how this limit should be taken, which may depend on the biological context
in question.
Having only considered closures of a single structured population, there
are a multitude of biologically relevant extensions that could be considered.
Perhaps the most natural generalisation is to account for multiple interacting
species that are themselves structured, exploring if and how the interactions
between the species impacts on the form and existence of exact closures. A
further extension that aligns closely with biological and medical applications
is the consideration of alternative mechanisms of reproduction [Savill, 2003,
Komarova, 2013, Yang et al., 2015], or the impacts of a time-dependent exter-
nal factor such as a drug. Whilst evaluating the effects of fitness-independent
factors may be relatively straightforward, the arguably more intriguing pos-
sibility for fitness-dependent effects raises non-trivial mathematical questions
and promises to be a topic for significant future study. Additionally, an attempt
to move beyond polynomial fitness functions is a promising but challenging
direction for future work, as our analysis has been very sensitive to our choice
of function space. Initial explorations suggest that this is expected to require
case-dependent alternatives to µk that behave suitably under summation.
In summary, we have taken a classical model of population growth and
begun to explore the exact study of discretely structured analogues, with a
particular focus on moment closures. Restricting our exploration to a class of
models with a polynomial dependence on the structure variable, we have iden-
tified necessary and sufficient conditions for systems to admit exact closures.
In doing so, we have seen how restrictive the desire for exact closures can be,
whilst also finding that some freedom remains once any constraints have been
satisfied. Additionally, we have highlighted the potential benefits of studying
structure even in simply structured populations, with signatures present in
structured models able to yield mechanistic insight that might otherwise be
obfuscated by unstructured approaches.

Flux in both directions
The above analysis can be modified in a straightforward way to include fluxes
in the direction of decreasing j (increasing fitness), which perhaps can be
thought of as corresponding to some notion of repair. Explicitly, we introduce

the coefficients of the flux, analogous to ωβ in the other direction and subject
to similar conditions at the edges of the domain ( ˜w(0) = 0 and ˜w(N + 1) = 0
for convenience).
Adding this flux term to the general analysis of section 4.3 modifies eq. (26)

The resulting conditions for closure can then be derived in exactly the same
manner as in section 4.3. Once again, the results differ depending on the
complexity of the growth terms. If deg (n) = 1, closures can be found at any
order through appropriate choices of the flux terms, but now with additional
degrees of freedom afforded by the presence of ˜ω. For instance, if w and ˜w are
of the same degree, then the necessary and sufficient conditions for closure at
order K amount to the degree constraint
deg (n) = deg (w) −1 = deg ( ˜w) −1 ,
(A5)
and the single coefficient constraint

= 0 .

Combined with the requirements that w(N) = 0 and ˜w(0) = 0, this amounts
to 3 constraints on 6 coefficients (as both w and ˜w are quadratics in j), so
that significant freedom is afforded by having bidirectional fluxes. In contrast,

for deg (n) > 1, we again encounter the problem illustrated in eq. (34), in
which the dependence on µK−1+deg (n) cannot be eliminated in the equation
for µK−1. Hence, closures are never possible for deg (n) > 1, even with
bidirectional transport.
