Abstract
The eﬀectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by several elements of the tumour
microenvironment, which reduce the ability of the virus to infect cancer cells. In this work, we focus on the
inﬂuence of hypoxia on this therapy and develop a novel continuous mathematical model that considers both
the spatial and epigenetic heterogeneity of the tumour. We investigate how oxygen gradients within tumours
aﬀect the spatial distribution and replication of both the tumour and oncolytic viruses, focusing on regions
of severe hypoxia versus normoxic areas. Additionally, we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of tumour cells
under hypoxic conditions and their inﬂuence on susceptibility to viral infection. Our ﬁndings show that
the reduced metabolic activity of hypoxic cells may signiﬁcantly impact the virotherapy eﬀectiveness; the
knowledge of the tumour’s oxygenation could, therefore, suggest the most suitable type of virus to optimise
the outcome. The combination of numerical simulations and theoretical results for the model equilibrium
values allows us to elucidate the complex interplay between viruses, tumour evolution and oxygen dynamics,
ultimately contributing to developing more eﬀective and personalised cancer treatments.

Introduction
Among cancer therapies, oncolytic virotherapy stands out as a promising avenue that harnesses the natural capabilities
of viruses to selectively target and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues, [13, 28, 43, 47, 70]. Despite its
potential, the clinical eﬃcacy of oncolytic virotherapy faces signiﬁcant challenges, many of which stem from the complex
dynamics of the tumour microenvironment (TME) [40, 83].

The TME signiﬁcantly inﬂuences viral distribution and therapeutic eﬃcacy.
Factors such as extracellular matrix
composition, immune cell inﬁltration and hypoxic regions can impede viral penetration, replication and spread within
the tumour. These barriers create unpredictable, stochastic events that aﬀect the consistency of viral delivery and the
overall success of the therapy. Another interesting interaction involves the neovasculature that the tumour originates
through angiogenesis: most oncolytic viruses disrupt it by targeting tumour-associated vascular endothelial cells [40, 83].
On the one hand, the decrease in nutrient inﬂow contributes to slowing down cancer growth and, in this respect, oncolytic
virotherapy could act in the same way as antiangiogenic therapy. On the other hand, blood vessels also play a vital role
in the arrival of viral particles and immune cells [72].
The inadequate vascularisation within tumours reduces oxygen availability: this hypoxic condition is a hallmark of solid
tumours, signiﬁcantly aﬀects the tumour’s evolution and profoundly impacts treatment eﬃcacy [87]. Hypoxic regions
within tumours promote aggressiveness by harbouring cells with reduced metabolic activity and heightened resistance to
therapies. In the context of oncolytic virotherapy, the impact of hypoxia on therapeutic eﬃcacy is twofold [73]. Firstly,
hypoxic regions within tumours harbour cells less susceptible to viral infection and replication due to reduced metabolic
activity and altered cellular signalling pathways. Secondly, the physiological adaptations of tumour cells to hypoxia,
such as enhanced glycolytic metabolism and resistance to apoptosis, can confer resistance to viral-induced cell death. It
is important to remark that the previous considerations are not universal: indeed, some particular oncolytic viruses can
speciﬁcally target receptors that are upregulated in case of the lack of oxygen [71, 73].
Understanding how hypoxia inﬂuences the interaction between OVs and tumour cells is crucial for optimising treatment
strategies and overcoming therapeutic resistance. Mathematical modelling is pivotal in unravelling these complexities
and optimising therapeutic outcomes. The dynamics of viral replication and tumour growth have been analysed through
several modelling approaches, ranging from ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) [2, 24, 75, 79, 37, 39, 46, 61, 81]
and partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) [3, 30, 29, 45, 66, 85, 86] to stochastic agent-based models [36, 74, 76, 82]
and hybrid multi-scale models [38, 62].
Some of these models also take into account aspects related to the tumour
microenvironment, such as spatial constraints due to the extracellular matrix [3, 38, 45, 66] and interactions with the
immune system [2, 24, 75, 79, 29, 38, 81, 86]. Only a few mathematical models describe virotherapy in hypoxic conditions.
In Ref. [68], the authors consider ODEs and nested ODEs (corresponding to infections in adjacent lymph nodes) under
the assumption that oxygen concentration directly inﬂuences the infection rate. The only spatial model that we know in
this context is the one presented in Ref. [14], in which the diﬃculties of treating hypoxic regions with standard therapies
motivate the use of macrophages that release oncolytic viral particles when experiencing low oxygen concentrations. The
lack of spatial models that consider the inﬂuence of oxygen concentration on virotherapy eﬀectiveness motivates the
present work.
In the absence of viral infection, several approaches have been developed to understand the inﬂuence of hypoxia on
tumour dynamics, using either discrete compartments that evolve according to diﬀerent dynamics [8, 34, 55, 69] or
a continuous spectrum of adaptation levels [5, 6, 32]. The latter approach in the continuous settings leads to integro-
diﬀerential equations (IDEs) and, when spatial heterogeneity is included, to partial integro-diﬀerential equations (PIDEs)
[19, 26, 53, 77]. We build upon this modelling approach and consider the heterogeneous eﬀects of oncolytic virotherapy
within the framework of spatial and phenotypic variability.
A common characteristic of continuous structured models is the presence of a trade-oﬀbetween diﬀerent features, in
the sense that the increase of a speciﬁc ability corresponds to the decrease of a diﬀerent trait: in the context of hypoxia,
this trade-oﬀusually involves the proliferation rate and the resistance to hypoxic conditions; in the case of infections,
one may consider a trade-oﬀinvolving the susceptible compartment between proliferation rate and resistance to the
infection [52]. In this work, we combine both trade-oﬀs and assume that less proliferative cells have slower metabolic
activity, resulting in a higher resistance to hypoxic conditions and a lower infection rate in the presence of oncolytic
virus. More in detail, our model incorporates both spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells, along with the
dynamics of oxygen concentration and viral infection; the model is formulated using a combination of partial diﬀerential
equations (PDEs) and partial integro-diﬀerential equations (PIDEs), explicitly accounting for the spatial gradients of
oxygen within the tumour. Such a modelling approach allows us to perform a formal asymptotic analysis of simpliﬁed
settings to compute the homogeneous equilibrium values.
It is important to remark that the use of a continuous trait variable to describe the system’s heterogeneity has been
widely employed for equations that share some formal similarities to the ones analysed in the present work, both in
the epidemiological settings [1, 11, 50, 52] and the ecological settings [20, 21].
In oncolytic virotherapy, structured
2
populations have been used in Ref. [23] in relation to the time from infection and in Ref. [41] to model various kinds
of heterogeneity, including susceptibility to infections, death rates, and virulence; neither of them considers trade-oﬀs
similar to the ones we aim to investigate. As previously mentioned, in this work, we build upon the model presented in
Ref. [52] and include spatial heterogeneity and environmental factors that inﬂuence the dynamics (as in Refs. [19, 18]);
to our knowledge, both aspects constitute a novelty with respect to the existing literature.
In this work, we aim to
- characterise the impact of hypoxia on viral infection and investigate how oxygen gradients within tumours aﬀect
the spatial distribution and replication of the tumour and the oncolytic viruses, with a focus on regions of severe
hypoxia versus normoxic areas;
- explore evolutionary dynamics and analyse how hypoxia-induced adaptations in tumour cells inﬂuence their sus-
ceptibility to viral infection, the epigenetic composition of the tumour, and the emergence of resistant phenotypes
over time;
- consider the trade-oﬀbetween proliferation rate and resistance to hypoxia in view of optimising therapeutic strate-
gies to enhance the eﬃcacy of oncolytic virotherapy in hypoxic tumour environments.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides the mathematical formulation of the model, detailing
the integration of viral dynamics, tumour evolution, and spatial oxygen gradients, and a brief theoretical analysis. In
Section 3, we present numerical simulations and explore the impact of hypoxia on the eﬃcacy of oncolytic virotherapy;
we also mention the situation of a virus that speciﬁcally targets hypoxic cells, looking towards the combination of several
therapies. Section 4 concludes the paper by summarising the key ﬁndings and discussing the implications of these ﬁndings
for optimising treatment strategies.

Modelling framework
We consider the epigenetic heterogeneity of uninfected cancer cells and assume that it aﬀects resistance to hypoxia in
addition to proliferation and infection. The dynamics of infected cells, instead, are not aﬀected by epigenetic charac-
teristics, hence we model them as a homogeneous population. We ﬁrst describe the model and then carry out a simple
asymptotic analysis to characterise the equilibrium of the problem under the assumption of stationary oxygen.
2.1
Model description
Let us denote by t ∈[0, +∞) the time variable, by x ∈Ωthe space variable, with Ω⊂R2 and by y ∈Y the epigenetic
variable, with Y := [0, 1]. We consider uninfected and infected cancer cells, whose densities are described respectively
by the functions u: [0, +∞) × Ω× Y →[0, +∞) and I : [0, +∞) × Ω→[0, +∞). We also deﬁne the uninfected total cell
density as
U(t, x) :=
Z
Y
u(t, x, y) dy
(2.1)
and the total cancer cell density as
ρ(t, x) := I(t, x) + U(t, x, y)
(2.2)
Finally, we consider viral density, described by the function v: [0, +∞) × Ω→[0, +∞), and oxygen concentration,
described by the function O: [0, +∞) × Ω→[0, +∞). We now describe in detail the rules governing all the dynamics.
Uninfected cancer cells
Uninfected cells may move via pressure-driven movement, change their epigenetic trait,
reproduce, become infected and die due to environmental selection. We assume a trade-oﬀbetween proliferation and
resistance to both hypoxia and viral infection. In this sense, we consider y as the level of expression of a set of genes
responsible for this trade-oﬀand normalise it so that y = 0 and y = 1 are, respectively, the lowest and highest possible
expressions: y = 0 corresponds to highest intrinsic proliferation rate, lowest resistance to hypoxia and highest infection
3
rate; conversely y = 1 corresponds to lowest intrinsic proliferation rate, highest resistance to hypoxia and lowest infection
rate. The evolution of uninfected cells is described by the equation
∂tu(t, x, y) =R(y, ρ(t, x), O(t, x), v(t, x)) u(t, x, y)
+ Dy ∂2

Random epigenetic mutations are described by a diﬀusive term in y with coeﬃcient Dy. Cancer cells also move with
coeﬃcient Dx in space against the gradient of the total cancer cell density ρ(t, x). Furthermore, uninfected cancer cells
proliferate at a rate determined by the intrinsic proliferation rate p(y) and the local cancer cell density ρ(t, x), according
to the logistic growth term
P(y, ρ) = p(y)


K

(2.3)
Uninfected cells may also die because of the environmental selection driven by oxygen concentration. The ﬁttest trait,
according to oxygen availability, is determined by the function
ϕ(O) :=




if O ≤Om
OM −O
OM −Om
if Om < O < OM
0
if O ≥OM
(2.4)
Thus, the selective term is expressed through a quadratic function of the distance of trait y from the ﬁttest one:
S(y, O) = η(y −ϕ(O))2
(2.5)
where η deﬁnes the time scale at which the process takes place. Finally, the virus infects uninfected cancer cells according
to the density of virions and the infection rate β(y).
Note that y is directly involved in the selection term; it also aﬀects proliferation and infection through the coeﬃcients
p(y) and β(y). To catch the above-described trade-oﬀ, we set
p(y) = pM −(pM −pm)y,
β(y) = βm + (βM −βm)y
(2.6)
Observe that both functions are increasing in y.
We remark that the terms for proliferation and selection are the same ones adopted in Ref.
[19].
In absence of
infections, the cell density always grows up to the same carrying capacity K irrespective of the oxygen level: this
constitutes a signiﬁcant diﬀerence with respect to some previous modelling approaches of hypoxic tumours (such as the
ones employed in Refs. [5, 4, 26, 78]) and allows us to consider virotherapy as the only cause of cancer reduction in
hypoxic conditions.
Infected cancer cell
Infected cells may move and die; uninfected cells may also become infected. The dynamics are
described by the equation
∂tI(t, x) = Dx div(I(t, x)∇ρ(t, x))
|

β(y)u(t, x, y) dy

|
{z

death
The movement follows the same law as that of uninfected cells, as there is no reason to assume that the infection has
some eﬀect on that. All the susceptible cells that undergo infection are collected in the same population. Finally, infected
cells die at rate qI.
We assume that infected cells do not proliferate, as the virus disrupts the cellular machinery, and are not aﬀected by
environmental conditions due to their short life. Consequently, they lack all the processes the epigenetic trait aﬀects,
which motivates their absence of epigenetic structure. This approach is the same one adopted in Ref. [52], with the only
diﬀerences that we here consider a spatial structure and infections mediated by a viral population.

Oncolytic virus
The virus is injected into the tumour, then diﬀuses in space with coeﬃcient Dv and decays with
rate qv. The lysis of an infected cell releases α viral particles. The dynamics are described by the equation
∂tv(t, x) = Dv∆v(t, x)

(2.7)
The injection is modelled through a Dirac delta, which corresponds to a jump in the viral concentration at time Tinj; the
spatial proﬁle of the injection is given by the function vinj.
Oxygen
The oxygen is delivered by tissue vascularisation with a space-dependent intensity Q(x), diﬀuses in space
with diﬀusion coeﬃcient DO and is consumed both by healthy tissue and cancer cells. The resulting equation is
∂tO(t, x) = DO∆O(t, x)

(2.8)
We assume that healthy cells initially ﬁll the tissue up to carrying capacity and their oxygen consumption is indirectly
modelled through the decay at rate qO. As the tumour grows, healthy cells are replaced by cancer cells, which consume
more oxygen: the additional consumption is captured by the term λρ(t, x)O(t, x).
Observe that both infected and
uninfected cells are responsible for oxygen consumption in the same way and the epigenetic trait of uninfected cells does
not aﬀect the consumption (as already done in Ref. [18]).

with the previously deﬁned ρ(t, x) in Eq. (2.2), P(y, ρ(t, x)) in Eq. (2.3), S(y, O(t, x)) in Eq. (2.5) based on ϕ(O(t, x))
in Eq. 2.4, and p(y) and β(y) set as in Eq. (2.6). We keep the oxygen source Q(x) in general form and change it
according to the biological setting we aim to reproduce.
We deﬁne the Cauchy problem by imposing the initial conditions: u(0, x, y) = u0(x, y), I(0, x) = 0, v(0, x) = 0,
O(0, x) = O0(x), where u0(x, y) and O0(x) will be deﬁned in the context of the various scenarios in Section 3; we
always assume that the tumour initially grows without viral infection and the therapy is administered after some time.
Moreover, we impose no ﬂux boundary conditions on ∂Y , i.e. ∂yu(t, x, 0) = ∂yu(t, x, 1) = 0, corresponding to the fact
that the epigenetic trait cannot assume values below 0 or above 1. Finally, we also impose no ﬂux boundary condition
for all u(t, x, y), I(t, x), v(t, x) and O(t, x) at ∂Ω, meaning that these quantities cannot leave the spatial domain.
2.2
Theoretical insights
The stationary equilibrium values of the system described in Eq. (2.9) can be computed through formal asymptotic
analysis. Building upon the methods employed in Refs. [49, 51, 77], we introduce a small parameter ε and assume that
Dx = ε,
Dy = Dv = DO = ε2
5
Furthermore, we use the time scaling t 7→
t
ε, which allows us to study the long-time behaviour of the system. The
computations performed in Appendix A show that the equilibria with a persistent infection solve the system

In Appendix A, we also discuss the case of infection-free equilibria.
The above system is too complicated to be studied analytically; hence, we mainly consider numerical solutions.
Although six solutions exist, only one is biologically meaningful in the parameter range that we consider. A more useful
expression can be obtained by solving the equation ∂yR = 0 in ¯y:

This formula has a straightforward interpretation: ϕ( ¯O) is the epigenetic trait selected by the oxygen concentration; the
ﬁttest trait tends to decrease when the total cell population ρ is low due to the diﬀerent proliferation rates of cell lines
in a situation of low competition; at the same time, it grows in the presence of viral infection that targets proliferative
cells and it reduces if the infection targets hypoxic cells. We remark that this formula may yield a value of ¯y outside the
interval [0, 1], which has no meaning in our formulation of the model: when this happens, we should expect the ﬁttest
trait to be 0 if ¯y < 0 and 1 if ¯y > 1.
A simpler situation is obtained by assuming that tumour dynamics do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect oxygen density so that
¯O is given a priori; in this case, the system becomes

It is then possible to obtain a third-degree equation for ¯y, which in principle can be solved; however, the explicit
solutions are still too complicated to give any useful information. Fig. 1 shows the numerical solution of Eq. (2.12)
that is biologically meaningful. In the reference situation (βm < βM), the equilibrium values of ¯U and ¯y increase as
the oxygen values decrease; when the values of βM and βm are switched, we observe the inverse behaviour. The eﬀect
of oxygen variations on ¯I is more complex, as its value is almost constant for a wide range of oxygen values and then
signiﬁcantly decreases only when the oxygen concentration is very low (or very high).
So far, we have focused our discussion on the spatially homogeneous situation. To our knowledge, spatial dynamics in
this context have not been studied analytically, not even in simpler settings (such as the one of Ref. [52]). Nevertheless,

given the forthcoming numerical simulations, it is helpful to recall some elementary facts. If we neglect the epigenetic
structure, the one-dimensional dynamics of uninfected cells in the absence of viral infection follow the equation
∂tu(t, x) = Dx∂x(u(t, x)∂xu(t, x)) + p

1 −u(t, x)


u(t, x)
It is well-known that there exist travelling waves solutions of this equation with speed at least
p
DxKp/2 and an initial
condition with compact support evolves into a wave that travels with the minimal speed [7, 60]. The addition of infection
due to cell-to-cell contact originates travelling waves of the two populations (uninfected and infected), with the uninfected
proliferative cells trying to escape from the infected cells [58]; the addition of a viral population does not signiﬁcantly
change this picture. It is important to remark that an eﬃcient infection results in a wavefront much lower than the
carrying capacity, whose invasion speed is lower than
p
DxKp/2.

Numerical results
In this Section, we compare numerical simulations with the theoretical results described in the previous Section. The
parameter values are listed in Table 1; in Appendix B, we explain how the values have been chosen, as well as the
numerical method employed.
In all the simulations, we start with an uninfected tumour of the form
u0(x, y) =



θy
if Au e
−|x−x0|2
θx
−(y−y0)2
θy

otherwise
(3.1)
The truncation is performed in order to have an initial condition with compact support; the form of the equations is
such that the solution will still be compactly supported at all times [7, 60]. In all the simulations we set x0 = (0, 0),
y0 = ϕ(O(0, x0)), θx = 0.5, θy = 0.5. The parameter Au is set to
Au = 7.19 × 104 cell/mm3
Z
Y
e
−(y−y0)2
θy
dy
This choice allows a maximal initial total cell density equal to K
10, irrespective of the value of y0. We then assume that
viral injection is performed after some time so that the tumour can adapt to the environment. In most of the cases, we
perform a central viral injection as soon as the tumour reaches a given size: in mathematical terms, we set
Tinj := inf { t ∈[0, +∞) | d(t) ≥dinj }
(3.2)
where dinj is the tumour size at which we choose to inject the virus and
d(t) := diam

x ∈Ω
 ρ(x, t) ≥K
10

We recall that the diameter of a general set E is deﬁned as
diam E := sup { |x1 −x2| | x1, x2 ∈E }
In the particular situation of a circle, this deﬁnition coincides with the standard diameter; in the general case, the
diameter is the longest length found inside the set. This choice is based on the assumption that small tumours cannot
be clinically detected, hence the therapy may only start when cancer cells reach a density of at least one tenth of the
carrying capacity in a large region. We set dinj = 5.2 mm, as in [44] and the central viral injection takes the form
vinj(x) = Av e−|x−x0|2
θv
(3.3)
with Av = 7 × 109, θv = 0.5.
This allows for a total number of viral particles in agreement with the experiments
performed in [44].
For the sake of simplicity, we ﬁrst consider in Subsection 3.1 a stationary oxygen distribution independent of time,
corresponding to a situation in which the tumour does not inﬂuence the oxygen distribution: while this is clearly an
oversimpliﬁcation, it allows us to focus our attention on the tumour’s evolutionary and infectious dynamics. We then
analyse in Subsection 3.2 the full model, which includes oxygen dynamics, taking into account diﬀerent conﬁgurations
of oxygen sources. Finally, in Subsection 3.3 we brieﬂy mention the case of a virus that speciﬁcally infects hypoxic cells,
looking towards the combination of oncolytic virotherapy with other treatments.

We plot the solutions at time t∗= 1500 h. Only the horizontal section is shown to facilitate the comparison. The blue
lines in the left plot represent the proﬁle of uninfected cancer cells U(t∗, x). In the right plot, the green lines show the
average epigenetic trait µ(t∗, x) and the light-blue lines show the ﬁttest trait selected by the environment ϕ(O(t∗, x)).
3.1
Stationary oxygen
The most elementary situation is obtained by considering that the oxygen concentration is constant in space and time.
We focus on three oxygen values, namely OM (normoxia), Om (severe hypoxia) and their average Om+OM
2
(physiological
hypoxia), whose corresponding selected traits are respectively 1, 0 and 0.5; other values produce intermediate situations.
We then consider inhomogeneous oxygen distributions, which resemble more biologically meaningful situations.
To make the comparison between the epigenetic composition and spatial characterisation more straightforward, we
introduce the average epigenetic trait, deﬁned as
µ(t, x) :=
R
Y u(t, x, y) y dy
U(t, x)
for all (t, x) such that U(t, x) ̸= 0
Observe that this condition is not satisﬁed in the whole domain due to the compact support of u.
Homogeneous oxygen distribution and no viral infection
As a starting point, it is helpful to observe how
a tumour evolves in these environmental conditions without treatment, as shown in Fig. 2 for t = 1500 h (for the sake
of clarity, the ﬁgure represents the central section of the domain, i.e. the set [−L, L] × {0}). The left panel shows the
total uninfected cell density U(t, x), which in absence of infection coincides with the total cancer density ρ(t, x); the
right panel shows the average epigenetic trait µ(t, x). Overall, we observe the behaviour predicted by the theoretical
asymptotic analysis in all the cases. The three initial conditions are given by Eq. (3.1) with y0 = ϕ(O). However, the
density ρ at the beginning is much lower than K; hence, unless we are in a normoxic situation, the ﬁttest epigenetic trait
is lower than ϕ(O), as predicted by Eq. (2.11); on the other hand, in the normoxic situation ϕ(O) = 0 is already the
lowest attainable value. As time passes, the cell density grows close to carrying capacity and the cancer starts to invade
the surrounding area at a speed approximately proportional to the square root of the proliferation rate. In the hypoxic
scenarios, the ﬁttest epigenetic trait grows with ρ until reaching the value ϕ(O); however, that trait is never completely
selected due to epigenetic diﬀusion. An important consequence of the presence of diﬀerent epigenetic characteristics is
the fact that ρ is always slightly below K, as the oxygen selection never completely stops: this eﬀect is especially evident
in the hypoxic situation, in which the slow proliferation contrasts the selective pressure less eﬀectively. It is important
to observe that in all cases the average epigenetic traits are lower at the invasion front, due to the lower total densities,
and increase as we get close to the tumour centre. Overall, high oxygen levels are associated with more proliferative
tumours, which reach carrying capacity earlier and invade the surrounding tissues faster.

Homogeneous oxygen distribution and virotherapy
From the previous discussion, it could appear that
hypoxic tumours do not constitute a signiﬁcant threat; however, this situation overturns in the presence of treatment,
as the adaptation to hypoxia makes the tumour less susceptible to therapies. Indeed, Fig.
3, along with the video
accompanying it (see electronic supplementary material S2), shows the eﬀect of oncolytic virotherapy on the tumours
described above. The diﬀerent growth rates imply that the viral injection is performed at diﬀerent times in the three
situations: this happens respectively around t = 426 h for normoxia, t = 471 h for physiological hypoxia and t = 609 h
for severe hypoxia. To facilitate the comparison between the diﬀerent scenarios, Fig. 3 shows the section of the simulation
approximately 1800 h after the viral injection. In all three cases, the central region of the tumour is quickly infected and
viral particles are able to reach the tumour front in a relatively short time due to their fast diﬀusion. In the severely
hypoxic case, this initial successful infection might appear surprising. Still, it can be easily explained by the fact that at
Tinj the tumour has not reached the carrying capacity yet and the epigenetic characteristics are still not fully adapted
to the environment (the lack of complete adaptation is also true in the other cases, but less evident).
The following dynamics appear quite diﬀerent in the three cases. In the normoxic case (Fig. 3a), cell densities at
the centre of the tumour converge with damped oscillations to the equilibrium predicted by the theoretical analysis.
The average of the epigenetic traits in the central area sensibly increases right after the viral injection, then oscillates
towards the equilibrium. It is interesting to observe that epigenetic traits at the invasion front are lower since, in this
area, both ρ and I are lower; in other words, tumour invasion is guided by the most proliferative cells. The situation
is qualitatively similar in the physiologically hypoxic case (Fig. 3b), but the equilibrium value for U is higher. The
spatial diﬀerence of the average epigenetic trait is much more evident than in the previous case: the convergence to the
equilibrium value is slower than before and takes place mainly from the lower side. While these two situations can be
described as partial successes of the therapy, the severely hypoxic case (Fig. 3c) is clearly a complete failure: the tumour
density decreases only for a short time, after which it starts to regrow up to around 90% of carrying capacity, with a
very small fraction of infected cells (not shown here, see electronic supplementary material S2); we remark that such a
low number of cells may model a situation of extinction due to stochastic events. After approximately 400 h, there is a
relapse of the infection, which causes a small decrease in the total cell density followed by a subsequent regrowth towards
the theoretical equilibrium. The convergence is extremely slow and it is clear from Fig. 3c that 1800 h after the viral
injection the dynamics are still far away from the equilibrium. This can be explained by the fact that the smaller growth
rate slows down all the evolutionary dynamics, hence it takes longer for the ﬁttest trait to be selected. Furthermore, the
model is restricted to values y ≤1, hence the theoretical value ¯y > 1 is unattainable; the convergence to 1 necessarily
takes place from below and this makes the uninfected population more susceptible to the infection. We remark that
longer numerical simulations conﬁrm the convergence towards 1 with the associated cell densities (not shown). However,
the equilibrium is reached only after a very long time, therefore from the application point of view we should note that
the treatment outcome is slightly better than expected (although still not successful).
Inhomogeneous oxygen distribution
We now increase the model complexity by considering spatial homo-
geneities of the oxygen. We consider the following oxygen spatial proﬁles:
1. O(x) = Om + (OM −Om)e
|x|2
20
(antigaussian);
2. O(x) = Om +
h1
2 + 1
π arctan
x1
2
i
(OM −Om) (step-like proﬁle).
The ﬁrst proﬁle is chosen to qualitatively resemble the oxygen distribution obtained after the tumour’s consumption and
we expect to observe dynamics somehow similar to the ones described below when we drop the stationarity assump-
tion. The second one represents a tumour that grows at the boundary between two regions with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
vascularisation.
The numerical results of these two cases are shown in Fig. 4, along with the videos accompanying it (see electronic
supplementary materials S3 and S4),. We again represent the solutions approximately 1800 h after the viral injections,
which take place respectively at times t = 565 h and t = 470 h. The extremely slow growth in the ﬁrst situation is
due to the severely hypoxic conditions that characterise the initial growth: although this is probably unrealistic, later
dynamics appear comparable to biologically meaningful scenarios. In both cases, we observe behaviours coherent with the
previous ﬁndings, with the invasion led by slightly more proliferative cells and the slower convergence to the theoretical

equilibrium in the hypoxic areas. The signiﬁcance of these situations is the emergence of new selective dynamics that
occur when the tumour reaches areas with diﬀerent oxygen levels: in this respect, the eﬀectiveness of virotherapy diﬀers
signiﬁcantly from point to point.
Another signiﬁcant aspect is the nonsymmetrical conﬁguration of the step-like proﬁle, which allows to analyse the
inﬂuence of the oxygenation on the invasion speed. Fig. 5 shows the result of the simulation in the whole domain and it
is clear that the average epigenetic trait at the front signiﬁcantly diﬀers in the diﬀerent directions. We recall that, in the
case of pressure-driven movement, the invasion speed is higher for high cell proliferation rate and high cell density. In
the case of our interest, fast proliferation is associated with eﬀective viral infection, which results in a lower cell density:
as a consequence, a priori, it is not trivial to understand which conditions are associated with a faster invasion. The
circle in Fig. 5 elucidates this aspect well, by showing that the fastest invasion still occurs in the most oxygenated area.
3.2
Inclusion of oxygen dynamics
In the previous section, we started with a basic model with homogeneous and stationary oxygenation, considering diﬀerent
concentration levels; we subsequently included complexity in the model by considering spatial heterogeneity. We now
continue this progressive enrichment of the model toward realistic biological scenarios and consider the whole dynamics
of Eq. (2.9), in which oxygen varies both in space and time according to Eq. (2.8). A spatially heterogeneous oxygen
source allows us to consider vessels of diﬀerent sizes and, thus, with variable blood ﬂow.
We consider a source of the form
Q(x) = qO ¯O(x)
where ¯O(x) is the oxygen proﬁle that we would observe in the absence of the tumour. We remark that the actual oxygen
distribution is always below these values due to the increased oxygen consumption of cancer cells. We consider the
following oxygen proﬁles:
1. ¯O(x) = OM (normoxia);
2. ¯O(x) = 3 Om (hypoxia);
3. ¯O(x) = 3 Om +

4. ¯O(x) = 3 Om + (OM −3 Om)

15
with x1 := (−4, 4), x2 := (3, −6) and x3 := (6, −3) (source with three
peaks).
The homogeneous sources aim at reproducing uniformly vascularised tissues, which, in the absence of a tumour, are
either normoxic or physiologically hypoxic. The step-like source models a tissue with two distinguishable areas due to
diﬀerent oxygen inﬂow rates. Finally, the last source proﬁle constitutes an example of a tissue in which heterogeneous
vascularisation leads to a varied oxygen proﬁle.
We use as initial condition O0(x) the steady state of Eq. (2.8), i.e., the solution of the equation
DO∆O(t, x) −qOO(t, x) −λρ(0, x)O(t, x) + Q(x) = 0
where ρ(0, x) =
R
Ωu0(x, y) dy and u0 is given in Eq. (3.1). We remark that our parameter choice allows to have the
same values of ρ(0, x) for all y0; as a consequence, it still makes sense to deﬁne y0 = ϕ(O0(0)).
The results are collected in Figs.
6 and 7, along with the videos accompanying it (see electronic supplementary
materials S5, S6 and S7),. The arrangement of plots in Fig. 6 is analogous to Fig. 3, with the inclusion of ϕ(O(0, x)) in
the right panels: this allows to quantify the variation in time of the oxygen concentration due to tumour growth and the
consequent evolution of the trait selected by environmental conditions. Fig. 7 shows the simulation result in the whole
domain and highlights how the source heterogeneity aﬀects the dynamics.
In all four cases, the initial tumour growth causes a drop in oxygen concentration, reducing the environmentally
optimal epigenetic trait; consequently, the tumour growth progressively slows down. The variation of oxygen level is a
new selective pressure, which could not be considered in the stationary oxygen situation. The dynamics in the centre of
the tumour are characterized by a progressive adaptation, with the oxygen that reduces as the cell density grows and

Figure 6: Comparison of the results obtained from numerical simulation of the full model at time t∗, corresponding to
approximately 1800 h after viral injection. Three spatial oxygen conditions are considered: normoxia (solid lines, panel

see the main text. All the graphical elements have the same meaning as in Fig. 3. In addition, a thinner light blue line
in the right panels provides the ϕ proﬁle at the initial state. The equilibria are now computed from Eq. (2.10).

the average epigenetic trait that increases as the oxygen density decreases. We remark that in this initial phase, the
actual ﬁttest trait is always lower than the one selected by the environment due to the distance from carrying capacity;
as time passes, this diﬀerence becomes less evident. In the meantime, the invasion fronts are more oxygenated, which
contributes to the selection of proliferative traits in this area; this behaviour resembles the dynamics observed in the
case of antigaussian stationary oxygen distribution. Spatial heterogeneity aﬀects the invasion in the cases of step-like
and multiple peak sources.
As with stationary oxygen, the viral injection constitutes an additional selective pressure. The virotherapy causes
a signiﬁcant decrease in the cancer population, which allows the reoxygenation of the tissue. Nevertheless, the initial
selective pressure of the infection appears more substantial than the environmental pressure, and the average epigenetic
trait signiﬁcantly increases.
As time passes, the infection is more eﬀective in the well-oxygenated areas: this keeps
the cancer population low and avoids an excessive reduction in the oxygen concentration, which would result in a less
eﬀective infection. Conversely, in the less oxygenated areas, the tumour grows up to close to carrying capacity; hence,
the oxygen concentration reduces further and the environmental conditions contribute to the selection of cells resistant
to the infection.
Fig. 6 shows that the solutions of the equation approach the theoretical estimates, but the convergence is slower
than in the case of stationary oxygen. This is particularly evident in the hypoxic areas due to the slow evolutionary
dynamics related to the low growth rate, as already observed for stationary oxygen, and it is now accentuated by the fact
that it takes time for the oxygen distribution to reach equilibrium. Furthermore, our tools do not allow to characterise
the wavefront, whose dynamics are signiﬁcantly far from equilibrium. Nevertheless, the theoretical values still provide
signiﬁcant information regarding the success of the therapy.
Overall, the main dynamics observed in Subsection 3.1 can be replicated without ﬁxing a priori the oxygen distribution
(which is not representative of realistic biological scenarios); oxygen dynamics signiﬁcantly enriches the evolutionary
dynamics. Initial condition referable as normoxic (panel (a)) or physiologically hypoxic (panel (b)) in the absence of the
tumour become respectively physiologically and severely hypoxic due to cancer: in this sense, these two settings can be
considered as a “trait d’union” with the previous simulations. Similar dynamics can also be observed in the presence of
more complex oxygen sources, such as the three-peaked source of Fig. 7: this suggests that the knowledge of the oxygen
distribution in a tumour may predict the outcome of the virotherapy in clinical settings.
3.3
Hypoxia-speciﬁc oncolytic viruses
All the simulations presented so far rely on the assumption that viral infection is less eﬀective in hypoxic cells: this can
be explained by their slower metabolic activity, which also aﬀects the translation of viral proteins [73]. Nevertheless, one
should note that some particular oncolytic viruses can speciﬁcally target receptors that are upregulated in case of the
lack of oxygen [71, 73]. This property appears particularly promising in light of the ineﬀectiveness of most classic cancer
therapies in hypoxic conditions [87].
Therefore, we revert the previous trade-oﬀand exchange the values of βM and βm, so that the function β(y) is
increasing; the rest of the model remains unchanged. The asymptotic analysis of Appendix A does not rely on any
characterisation of the values of β and all the equations obtained are still valid: the only relevant diﬀerence is the fact
that Eq. (2.11) now predicts a decrease of the ﬁttest value in the presence of viral infection. The equilibrium values
depicted in Fig. 1b indeed shows that the virotherapy’s eﬀectiveness increases as the oxygen concentration decreases, in
line with the biological situation we aim to model.
Fig. 8, along with the video accompanying it (see electronic supplementary material S8), shows the full model results
for the oxygen sources corresponding to normoxia and hypoxia. In the case of normoxia (Fig.
8a), we observe the
failure of the therapy: despite the persistence of the infection, the uninfected cell density is now approximately twice
the value observed in Fig. 6a; furthermore, the expansion of the tumour is much faster than in the case of virotherapy
with standard viruses that target non-hypoxic cells. Both these phenomena are caused by the fact that viral infection
selects cells with a value of the epigenetic trait lower than the one selected by environmental conditions alone, which
are both more proliferative and more resistant to the infection. Interestingly, the results are not trivial: indeed, a priori,
one could expect that the hypoxic condition caused by the tumour growth would be associated with a large number of

Figure 8: Comparison of the results obtained from numerical simulation of the full model in the case of hypoxia-targeting
oncolytic viruses at time t∗, corresponding to approximately 1500 h after viral injection. We now consider an earlier
time than in the previous simulations, as the infection in this case promotes the selection of more proliferative cells and,
at later times, we would observe boundary eﬀects in the normoxic case. Two spatial oxygen conditions are considered:
normoxia (solid lines, panel (a)) and hypoxia (dashed lines, panel (b)); the oxygen sources are the same as in Figs. 6a-b.
All the graphical elements have the same meaning as in Fig. 3.

hypoxic cells, which are eﬀectively targeted by the virus. Our mathematical model is thus helpful to shed light on these
complex interactions.
The situation of physiological hypoxia appears much more promising (Fig. 8b). Again, we observe a decrease in
the average epigenetic trait caused by virotherapy, as expected from the theoretical results; consequently, the tumour’s
invasion speed is also higher. Nevertheless, the cell lines selected are not too resistant to the infection and the tumour
cell density appears comparable to that observed in the case of normoxia treated by a standard virus. The important
consequence is that the eﬀectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy can be increased by selecting the most appropriate kind of
virus based on the oxygenation of the tumour.
The comparison between the two kinds of oncolytic viruses in the case of physiological hypoxia is further elucidated
in Fig. 9, in which we consider the total number of cancer cells in the domain
M(t) :=

ρ(t, x) dx

In all cases, the main contribution to cell death is caused by viral infection, meaning that the therapy is always at least
partially eﬀective. The solid lines refer to the situation in which the oxygen concentration is not aﬀected by the tumour
and allow us to understand the role of oxygen dynamics; for the sake of brevity, this simulation is only performed in the
case βm < βM. The comparison with the analogous simulation of the full model (dashed lines) shows that more cells
are killed by environmental selection in the case of variable oxygen: indeed, hypoxia exerts a more signiﬁcant action
when the tumour needs to adapt to an evolving environment. The viral infection is more eﬃcient in the latter case since
it takes a long time for the tumour to fully adapt to the hypoxic state and become resistant to the infection. When
the hypoxia-speciﬁc virus is considered, the infection appears signiﬁcantly more eﬀective. It is also remarkable that the
environmental selection is more relevant in the last situation: indeed, the value of ¯y given by Eq. (2.11) is now much
lower than ϕ(O) (see again Figs. 6b and 8b), as for βM < βm both terms in the square bracket are negative; in other
words, the infection favours cells that are less resistant to hypoxia. We should therefore conclude that the therapeutic
eﬀectiveness is also due to environmental selection.
Although the use of hypoxia-selective oncolytic viruses appears promising, our ﬁndings also stress that tumour erad-
ication is still far from achieved.
Furthermore, the cell lines selected are the most proliferative; hence, if the viral
infection stopped for some external reason (such as immune response), the tumour would quickly regain its aggressive-
ness. Nonetheless, it is essential to observe that the average epigenetic trait is signiﬁcantly reduced with respect to the
one that environmental conditions would select; consequently, the tumour is now sensitive to standard treatments that
lose their eﬀectiveness in hypoxic conditions. This suggests that a hypoxic tumour could be eﬀectively treated using a
combination of therapies targeting cells with diﬀerent degrees of adaptation to hypoxia [73].

Conclusions
In this work, we have introduced a novel oncolytic virotherapy model that considers the epigenetic evolution of cancer
cells due to viral infection and hypoxia. By integrating viral dynamics, tumour evolution, and spatial oxygen gradi-
ents, our model provides new insights into how hypoxic conditions within tumours aﬀect the eﬃcacy of oncolytic viral
therapies. Numerical simulations are coherent with the theoretical results obtained by a formal asymptotic analysis of
simpliﬁed settings and show how environmental conditions inﬂuence the capability of the virus to control tumour mass
expansions and, in particular, underscore the signiﬁcant impact of oxygen availability on viral infection rates, tumour cell
susceptibility and the overall success of virotherapy. We have considered some simple conﬁgurations of oxygen sources to
capture the fundamental dynamics. Our results suggest that hypoxia may constitute a signiﬁcant obstacle to the success
of oncolytic virotherapy. Furthermore, the infection contributes to selecting a subpopulation of cells well adapted to

hypoxia, which may be hard to kill even with other therapies. Hypoxic tumours appear to be more eﬀectively treated
with oncolytic viruses speciﬁcally targeting hypoxic cells, although tumour eradication still appears hard to achieve.
Our ﬁndings highlight several crucial aspects for optimising virotherapy: the presence of hypoxic regions can severely
limit the spread and replication of standard oncolytic viruses; in contrast, hypoxia-speciﬁc viruses are particularly
eﬀective in these areas. This suggests that therapeutic strategies need to account for spatial oxygen level variations.
The evolutionary dynamics of tumour cells under hypoxic stress and virotherapy pressure can lead to the emergence
of resistant phenotypes, indicating the need for adaptive treatment protocols that can mitigate resistance development.
One critical takeaway is the importance of considering the spatial heterogeneity of oxygen levels when designing and
implementing oncolytic virotherapy protocols. The model predicts that hypoxia can signiﬁcantly alter the distribution
and eﬀectiveness of viral therapy, thereby aﬀecting overall treatment outcomes. Additionally, the role of tumour cell
adaptations to hypoxic conditions highlights the necessity for dynamic treatment strategies that can respond to changes
in the tumour microenvironment.
The key assumption of this work is that, in general, the slower metabolic activity of hypoxic cells is associated with a
less eﬀective viral infection. This has been modelled by considering an infection rate β that depends on the adaptation of
cells to hypoxia. Our choice is motivated by the existing literature [52] and the possibility of obtaining some theoretical
insights. Other approaches would also be possible: for example, one may directly consider the dependence of viruses on
the host translational machinery to translate viral proteins; this would correspond to a viral burst size α that depends
on the oxygen concentration or on the level of metabolic activity of the cell (which could correspond to the variable y).
There are several promising directions for future research and the results may be extended in several ways, both
from the mathematical and the modeling perspectives. From the mathematical point of view, the formal asymptotic
analysis of Appendix A may constitute a good starting point for characterising the travelling waves shown in the
numerical simulations, at least in simpliﬁed settings. From a biological point of view, we aim to develop a model to
study the interaction of oncolytic virotherapy and radiotherapy, which aligns with the clinical interest of combining the
two therapies. Radiotherapy is well-known to decrease its eﬀectiveness in hypoxic conditions and several mathematical
models similar to the one in the present work have been developed to investigate this phenomenon [16, 18]. Although
the combination with oncolytic viruses that decrease their eﬃcacy due to hypoxia does not appear beneﬁcial, using
hypoxia-targeting oncolytic viruses could be promising.
Overall, our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities of oncolytic virotherapy under hypoxic
conditions and lays the groundwork for developing more eﬀective and personalised cancer treatments. In this context,
mathematical models could help design the optimal combination, considering contemporary, subsequent, or alternating
20
treatments and investigating doses, orders and timing according to the environmental conditions.

Formal asymptotic analysis
We now conduct a formal asymptotic analysis to compute the theoretical equilibrium values, as explained in Section 2.2.
We introduce a small parameter ε and assume that
Dx = ε,

even for very long times, similar to the ones described in Refs. [9, 67] (see also electronic supplementary material S9).
We then make for uninfected cells the real phase WKB ansatz [10, 25, 27], as it is common in the Hamilton–Jacobi

Under appropriate concavity hypotheses, we expect n to be a strictly concave function of y; we deﬁne

Let us ﬁx x ∈supp(ρ). The fact that ρε(t, x) < +∞for all ε implies that
n(t, x, ¯y(t, x)) = max

and therefore trivially
∂yn(t, x, ¯y(t, x)) = 0

implying that ∂tn(t, x, ¯y(t, x)) = 0; similarly, ∇xn(t, x, ¯y(t, x)) = 0.

Details of numerical simulations
B.1
Parameter values
Table 1 lists the parameters we adopt as a reference in the numerical simulations.
The majority of the parameters
has been estimated from the empirical literature, while a few others are speciﬁc to our formulation of the model and
have been set to reasonable values in order to reproduce plausible dynamics. Our two-dimensional simulations represent
the section of a tumour that is approximately homogeneous along the third spatial dimension (which can therefore be
neglected) and parameters are estimated in a three-dimensional setting.
The maximal duplication rate of uninfected cells pM, corresponding to the normoxic situation, has been taken equal
to log(2)/24 h−1 ≈2.88 × 10−2 h−1; the duplication time of 24 hours is among the fastest values reported in Ref. [42]
for glioblastoma. On the other hand, we assume that severely hypoxic cells duplicate in 48 hours, as done in Ref. [55]:
this leads to a minimal proliferation rate pm = 1.44 × 10−2 h−1. The carrying capacity K has been estimated assuming
that a cell has diameter 10 µm= 10−2 mm [48, §1.1]: this implies that the carrying capacity is 106 cells/mm3.
The spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient of tumour cells Dx has been estimated from the experimental data of the U343 control
group of [44], as already done in Refs. [58, 67]. In these experiments, the tumour volume passes in 40 days from 70 mm3
to 1000 mm3, which corresponds to a change in the tumour radius from approximately 2.6 mm to approximately 6.2 mm.
Hypoxia may play some role in the process, but this is not taken into account in their data: for the sake of simplicity,
we assume a moderately hypoxic situation so that the proliferation rate takes the value p(0.5) (i.e., the average between
pM and pm). Hence, the dynamics of uninfected cells in the absence of viral infection follow the equation

We assume that this coeﬃcient is the same also for infected cells, as a priori we have no reason to believe that the
infection aﬀects cellular movement.
The death rate of uninfected tumour cells due to oxygen-driven selection η and the epigenetic diﬀusion coeﬃcient
of tumour cells Dy are not easily accessible in the empirical literature, hence they have been adapted from previous
mathematical papers about epigenetically structured populations: their values have been set respectively to 1/48 h−1 ≈
4.16 × 10−2 h−1, which is of the same magnitude of the value used in Ref. [19], and 5.00 × 10−6 h−1, as in Ref. [16].
The maximal infection rate of the oncolytic virus βM has been set to 7.00 × 10−10 mm3/(viruses×h), as in Ref. [31];
their model does not explicitly take into account hypoxia, so we assume that they consider normoxic conditions. Since
we are not aware of any experimental estimate of infection rate under hypoxic conditions, we set βm to one fourth of
the value of βm. The death rate of infected cells qI has been taken equal to 1/24 h−1 = 4.17 × 10−2 h−1, following Ref.
[33]. The clearance rate of the virus has been set to 1/6, as in Ref. [57]. The viral load released by the death of infected
cells depends highly on the type of virus and ranges from the value 157 viruses/cells estimated in Ref. [84] to the value
3500 viruses/cells of Ref. [17]; we chose an intermediate value of α = 1000 viruses/cells. It is important to remark that
all these values are highly dependent on the exact type of oncolytic virus employed; our choices allow to model signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the eﬀectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy as the oxygen level varies. We remark that the outcome of the
therapy is mostly determined by the aggregate value βαqI/qv, hence similar dynamics may also be obtained by diﬀerent
parameter combinations that maintain the ratio unchanged (see also the discussion in Ref. [58]). The spatial diﬀusion
coeﬃcient of viral particles Dv has been set to 3.6 × 10−2 mm2/h, as in Ref. [31].
We consider the oxygen thresholds deﬁned in Ref. [56]: the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) in arterial blood is 70 mmHg
and we consider this as the maximal oxygen concentration (Omax); the physiological pO2 ranges approximately between
57 mmHg and 30.4 mmHg, so we consider the higher value as the normoxic threshold OM, keeping in mind that we
may observe lower oxygen values also in healthy tissue; the pathological hypoxic pO2 value is 7.6 mmHg, which we
consider as Om. All these pressure values are converted in volume ratios by multiplying them by the solubility constant
3 · 10−5 mm3
O2/(mm3
plasma×mmHg) [65].
We assume that the oxygen decay is due to the consumption of the healthy cells in the region. According to [80],
cells have an average rate of oxygen utilisation of 9.00 × 10−15 mol/(cell×h), corresponding approximately to 2.02 ×
10−7 mmO2/(cells×h), but this value may vary several orders of magnitude among diﬀerent cell types. We therefore
assume that a single healthy cell consumes six times this amount of oxygen when the available oxygen level is at Omax
and the consumption scales linearly with the oxygen concentration, meaning that the consumption in the case of unitary
cell density is given by O(t, x) multiplied by
1.21 × 10−6 mm3
O2
cell × h
1
Omax = 5.60 × 10−4 mm3/(cell × h)
Considering K as the healthy cell density in the absence of a tumour, we obtain a decay rate qO = 5.60 × 102 h−1.
We adopt a similar way of reasoning for the consumption by cancer cells, starting from the fact that the consumption
of a single cell is estimated to be 2.62 × 10−6 mmO2/(cells×h) [35] and assuming again that this is only possible when
the oxygen level is Omax. We then assume that cancer cells take the place of healthy cells, meaning that they cause an
additional consumption of
λ = 2.62 × 10−6mmO2/(cells × h)
Omax
−qO
K = 6.55 × 10−4 mm3/(cell × h)
The oxygen diﬀusion coeﬃcient DO has been set to 3.60 mm2/h, as in Ref. [59].

Numerical simulations are run until the ﬁnal time T = 2500 h, since their behaviour up to that moment is also
representative of later dynamics. For the spatial domain Ω= [−L, L]2 , we set L = 10 mm so that in most cases wave
fronts do not hit the boundary before T and the domain is representative of typical extensions of solid tumours.
B.2
Numerical method
Numerical simulations use a ﬁnite volume method developed by adapting the procedures presented in Refs. [12, 15] to
our problem. We discretise the space Ωwith a uniform mesh consisting of the cells
Cj,k := [x1,j−1
2 , x1,j+ 1
2 ] × [x2,k−1
2 , x2,k+ 1
2 ]
for j = 0, . . . , Nx1, k = 0, . . . , Nx2. Similarly, we discretise the space Ω× Y with the cells
Cj,k,m := [x1,j−1
2 , x1,j+ 1
2 ] × [x2,k−1
2 , x2,k+ 1
2 ] × [ym−1
2 , ym+ 1
2 ]
for j = 0, . . . , Nx1, k = 0, . . . , Nx2, and m = 0, . . . , Ny.
The sizes of the cells are thus respectively ∆x1 × ∆x2 and
∆x1 × ∆x2 × ∆y, where
∆xi =
2L
Nxi + 1
(i = 1, 2)
∆y =
1
Ny + 1
We set Nxi = 200 and Ny = 20.
The equations for infected cells, viruses and oxygen are not epigenetically structured and are of the form
∂tf(t, x) = M(t, x) + R(t, x)
where M(t, x) regulates the movement and R(t, x) the reactions. We adopt a splitting method, considering separately
the movement and reaction terms. The quantity of our interest is
fj,k(t) =

∆x1∆x2

Cj,k
f(t, x) dx
We begin with the conservative part M(t, x), which is given by
M(t, x) = D∆xf = D divx(∇xf)
in the case of virus and oxygen and by
M(t, x) = D divx(Φ(t, x)f),
Φ(t, x) = ∇xρ(t, x)
in the case of infected cells. In both situations, M involves the divergence of some quantity, hence the semi-discrete
scheme takes the form

in the case of pressure-driven movement. In this second case, Φ1 := ∂x1Φ and Φ2 := ∂x2Φ are the components of Φ
along the x1 and x2 axis respectively; furthermore, (·)+ and (·)−indicate respectively the positive and negative part of
their arguments, i.e., (·)+ = max{0, ·} and (·)−= min{0, ·}. Since our scheme is of order zero, the reconstruction of the
function is piecewise constant and thus assumes the same values at all the interfaces. In all the cases, the derivatives in
the middle points are evaluated as
(∂x1f)j+ 1

We use a uniform time discretisation of size ∆t = 5 × 10−1 h and denote with apex l the discretised time step, i.e.,
tl = l∆t. At all the iterations, we check that ∆t satisﬁes the positivity-preserving CFL for infected cells, namely

The fast oxygen dynamics require a reﬁned temporal discretisation. Hence, we set ∆tO = 6.95×10−5 (which is one-tenth
of the maximum size required by the CFL condition for oxygen) and perform several sub-iterations just for the oxygen
while maintaining all the other quantities constant.
For the reaction term R(t, x), we adopt a simple forward Euler method for the time derivative. We set the discretised
initial condition f 0
j,k provided for each j = 0, . . . , Nx1 and for k = 0, . . . , Nx2, being f l
j,k the numerical approximation of
fj,k(tl). The complete splitted numerical scheme reads

The equation for uninfected cells is epigenetically structured and takes the form
∂f
∂t (t, x, y) = M(t, x, y) + R(t, x, y)
where
M(t, x, y) = Dx divx(Φ(t, x)f) + Dy∆yf
