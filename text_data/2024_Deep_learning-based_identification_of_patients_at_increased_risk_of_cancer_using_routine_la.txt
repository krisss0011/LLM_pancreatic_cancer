ABSTRACT
Early screening for cancer has proven to improve the survival rate and spare patients from intensive and costly treatments
due to late diagnosis. Cancer screening in the healthy population involves an initial risk stratification step to determine the
screening method and frequency, primarily to optimize resource allocation by targeting screening towards individuals who
draw most benefit. For most screening programs, age and clinical risk factors such as family history are part of the initial risk
stratification algorithm. In this paper, we focus on developing a blood marker-based risk stratification approach, which could be
used to identify patients with elevated cancer risk to be encouraged for taking a diagnostic test or participate in a screening
program. We demonstrate that the combination of simple, widely available blood tests, such as complete blood count and
complete metabolic panel, could potentially be used to identify patients at risk for colorectal, liver, and lung cancers with areas
under the ROC curve of 0.76, 0.85, 0.78, respectively. Furthermore, we hypothesize that such an approach could not only be
used as pre-screening risk assessment for individuals but also as population health management tool, for example to better
interrogate the cancer risk in certain sub-populations.
Introduction
This paper focuses on the use of multiple biomarkers for the assessment of patients, or identification of otherwise healthy
individuals, who are at increased risk of cancer. With the high mortality rate associated with cancer patients, significant research
has been conducted to help identify patients at higher risk, starting with identifying medical conditions that increase the risk of
cancer, such as diabetes, or genetic predispositions that promote its development1. Furthermore, various screening procedures
have been developed to help facilitate early diagnosis such as the Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) and colonoscopy for
colorectal cancer (CRC)2, mammography for breast cancer3, and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer4.
However, cancer screening rates and their uptake remains lower than desired, e.g., in the US5. While there are several factors
contributing to this low uptake, one of the key factors is the lack of awareness within the general population. This is even
more important to address for people who may be at increased risk and would benefit from early and/or regular screening. In
other words, there is still a need for convenient tests for early detection of rapidly progressing diseases such as cancer so that
intervention can start as early as possible6.
Several cancer risk prediction/assessment tools based on demographic, socioeconomic or blood based markers have been
developed over the years, and studies have shown that cancer risk assessment algorithms could have an impact in early cancer
diagnosis7. For instance, the Qcancer 10 year risk algorithm8 considers the age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index,
smoking, alcohol, previous cancer diagnoses, family history of cancer, relevant comorbidities, and medication data for a patient
and predicts the cancer risk for 11 types of cancers. Nartowt et al.9 reported high concordance in the prediction of CRC into
low, medium and high groups using an artificial neural network trained on patient data comprising age, sex, and complete blood
count (CBC). ColonFlag10 can be used to identify individuals at high risk of CRC using specific blood-based markers and refer
them to screening procedures such as colonoscopy. More recently, a cell-free DNA-based blood test for the early detection of
CRC has been clinically validated in the ECLIPSE study11. Moreover, multi-cancer early detection technologies12 such as the
arXiv:2410.19646v1  [cs.LG]  25 Oct 2024
Galleri test13,14 can identify abnormal methylation patterns in cell-free DNA to detect a cancer signal and predict its origin.
Besides algorithm development, the deployment of the algorithm and communication of the findings play a critical role in
acceptance and clinical use of the algorithm15, and must be taken into account to facilitate screening uptake. To this end, instead
of defining a test with a specific set of ingredients catered towards a particular cancer, we propose to use commonly measured
blood markers, often obtained during the annual physical exam, and obtain a risk profile for multiple cancers. Furthermore,
instead of reporting a risk score, we compute the pre- and post-test odds of a patient at risk of developing cancer over the next
12 months.
A key challenge in developing a model that considers several biomarkers is to deal with a significant degree of missingness
in the historical data as not all markers may be obtained at each encounter. Although this issue can be partly alleviated by
considering the biomarkers obtained at an annual physical exam, we observed that in real world data, there is still a significant
degree of missingness, either due to a lack of awareness, insurance coverage or reimbursement, among other reasons. A
standard approach to deal with missingness in input data is to impute the missing values using statistical methods, such as
expectation maximization and regression16. However, the quality of imputed data is limited and can significantly impact the
generalization ability of the trained model.
In this work, we address the aforementioned challenges by training a deep learning model, Deep Profiler, which takes the
age, sex, and commonly obtained blood biomarkers included in CBC and Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), and outputs
a likelihood ratio of a patient to develop cancer over the period of the following 12 months (see Figure 1). The Deep Profiler
architecture employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) model that is pre-trained to impute missing data similar to the masked
language modeling technique. Subsequently, we train cancer-specific risk prediction models from the shared encoded latent
space and compute the likelihood ratio for each patient. We validate the proposed method over screening-relevant cohorts for
three different cancers - colorectal, liver, and lung. These are among the top cancers responsible for cancer related mortality
rate in the US (https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/common.html, accessed April 30, 2024.).

Results
Patient characteristics
To evaluate Deep Profiler across multiple cancer types, we created a cohort of individuals that either have no diagnosis of cancer,
or were diagnosed with malignant neoplasms of either colorectal, liver or lung. The validation cohorts each include nearly
2/15
5k patients with no cancer diagnosis, and 94, 189 and 224 patients who develop colorectal, liver or lung cancer, respectively.
Note that the patients in the validation set were not used during model development and training. The cohorts used for model
development include nearly 10k patients with no cancer diagnosis, and 293, 626 and 683 patients who develop colorectal, liver
or lung cancer, respectively. Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the statistics of various biomarkers, including age and sex,
over the entire cohort covering all three cancer types. Significant differences in the distributions of biomarker measurements in
cancer cohorts as compared to control cohorts are indicated.
Likelihood ratio
We train Deep Profiler ensembles to estimate cancer risk for three cancer types: colorectal, liver and lung cancer. Given
the biomarker values, the model outputs an array of risk scores (from the ensemble) for each cancer type, which are then
utilized to compute the likelihood ratio (LR) of post- to pre-test odds. LRs at increasing risk thresholds, together with Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, are shown in Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c for colorectal, liver, and lung cancer, respectively
(corresponding precision-recall curves are provided in Supplementary Figure S1).
Since NÃ¦ser et al. reported that the probability of cancer increased with the number of test results outside the reference
range17, we used the total out-of-reference-range (OoR) markers as a baseline. Indeed, cancer likelihood increases with the
total OoR markers. However, the increase is significantly lower as compared to the Deep Profiler models. Similarly, when
compared individually with any of the top-5 markers identified by the model for each cancer, Deep Profiler provides a 2-3 fold
improvement.
In CRC, age is the only factor considered to determine screening eligibility according to recommendations by the US
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)18. Therefore, we also provide an LR curve for age (normalized between 40 and 85
years) as the single indicator. While CRC shows increased prevalence until the age of about 60, the increase of LR provided by
Deep Profiler is significantly higher, with a 4-fold improvement in LR at a threshold greater than 0.8.
Overall, the liver-specific Deep Profiler model performs significantly better as compared to our Deep Profiler models for
CRC and lung cancer (LR of ~7.5 vs. ~4.5 at a threshold of 0.8, respectively), which is also reflected in the corresponding
ROC curves. Importantly, performance is preserved when assessed in cohort-specific subsets that only include cases for which
measurements for at least nine of top-15 markers are available, indicating that the models did not learn patterns related to
missing marker measurements.
Relevant biomarkers by cancer type
To gain insights into the laboratory markers with highest impact on the LR, we show cohort-level SHAP summaries for our
colorectal, liver, and lung cancer models in Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c, respectively. Since the LR can range from zero to infinity,
we passed the computed LR for each sample through a logistic function with mean 5 and scale 0.5. This ensures that outliers,
i.e., samples with significantly low or high LR, do not significantly impact the SHAP value distribution.
While only three (age, albumin and hematocrit) of the 15 most important laboratory markers are shared across all cancer
types (only age among the five most important markers), there are at least seven markers shared between any two cancer types.
In contrast, fine-tuned cancer type-specific prediction models are required to give more weight to markers predictive of only
one cancer type, as, in fact, one (neutrophils), three (total protein, WBC and basophils (%)), and three (BUN-creatinine ratio,
calcium, and ALT) markers are most important in only colorectal, liver, and lung cancer, respectively.
Several of the biomarkers that are identified as important in our SHAP analysis have also been independently studied and
reported. For instance, six of the 12 markers that were integrated into one or both sex-specific colon cancer prediction models
by Goshen et al.19 (ten of which are also available in our cohort) also appear to be most important in our CRC model (RDW,
MCV, neutrophils, monocytes, hemoglobin, and AST).
For liver cancer, there are currently no screening recommendations, except for hepatitis B carriers, who are recommended
by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) to start screening at age 40 and 50 years for men and
women, respectively. In our analysis, platelet counts appear as the most important blood marker predictor of liver cancer. In
fact, raised platelet counts (> 400 Ã 109/l) indicative of thrombocytosis, or even high-normal platelet counts (326â400 Ã 109/l)
have been reported to be associated with higher cancer incidence, in particular colorectal and lung cancer20. However, patients
with high-normal platelet counts had, in general, advanced-stage cancer at diagnosis, which may explain why platelets are
particularly important in our liver cancer model, as liver cancer is mostly detected at a late stage, emphasizing the need for
improved guidelines concerning screening eligibility.
Of note, the lack of a clear color gradation indicates interactions between different laboratory markers, illustrating the need
to train a holistic model by integrating multiple laboratory markers.
Analysis by comorbidities
For each of the cancer cohorts, we used phecodes21 to identify comorbidities that are more likely to be present in the underlying
population prior to cancer diagnosis. Relative odds ratios were computed to select comorbidities that are significantly different
3/15
between cancer and control samples using Fisherâs exact test (Figures 4a, 4b, and 4c). We found that those are usually the
conditions or symptoms that raise suspicion of cancer or other organ dysfunction in a cancer population. For instance, the top
three significant comorbidities prior to diagnosis in the CRC cohort are other disorders of the intestine, benign neoplasm of the
colon, and hemorrhage of rectum and anus (Figure 4a).
Since the FIT test screens stool for occult blood from the lower intestines, we use the subgroup of patients with blood in
stool as a surrogate to evaluate the added value of our model in comparison to an established screening test. Compared to the
base prevalence, we see an increase in LR greater than 3-fold, at a risk threshold greater than 0.8 (Figure 4a). Furthermore, we
also see added value in subgroups of patients with conditions such as hemorrhage of rectum and anus or gastrointestinal tract.
For lung cancer, the USPSTF criteria for screening comprise age and smoking history22. While our lung cohort does not
include smoking history, we analyzed the performance of our model on a subgroup of patients having a tobacco use disorder.
Notably, our model shows added value in identifying high-risk patients (more than 50 % increase in LR as compared to the
base prevalence, at a risk threshold greater than 0.9, Figure 4c).

Discussion
Here, we report on the development and evaluation of separate deep learning-based risk prediction models for three cancer
types based on routine laboratory marker measurements. Although other blood marker-based pan-cancer or cancer-specific
risk prediction models have been reported, a direct comparison of performance and markers identified to be important for risk
assessment is difficult due to varying (i) study designs, e.g., with respect to the follow-up period until cancer diagnosis (90
days23 vs. 365 days in our model), (ii) cancer prevalence in training and validation cohorts (25.2% in24 vs. 5.7 % in our lung
cohort), (iii) inclusion criteria (e.g., smoking history in lung cancer), (iv) number and availability of markers (e.g., restrict
to samples with complete data vs. imputation of missing data), (v) inclusion of non-routine blood markers (e.g., AFP and
CA-12517) as well as patient characteristics other than age and sex25. While the performance is not yet adequate enough for the
model to be used as a diagnostic test, we anticipate it to be a valuable tool for recruiting patients into screening programs and,
thus, increase screening uptake and efficiency overall, pending additional confirmatory studies. In future work, we also plan to
adopt the model to personalize the screening interval after a negative screening result (e.g., based on LDCT).
While the current USPSTF guideline for lung cancer screening only considers age and smoking history for screening
eligibility26, a multitude of risk prediction models have been proposed and reported to show improved performance over the
USPSTF criteria27. For instance, the PLCOm2012 model includes race, body mass index, education, presence of chronic lung
disease, personal history of cancer, and family history of lung cancer, in addition to age and smoking history28. Furthermore,
a four-marker protein panel (4MP), measuring a precursor form of surfactant protein B (Pro-SFTPB), cancer antigen 125
(CA-125), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), has been combined with PLCOm2012
to predict lung cancer risk29. However, the required biomarkers are not assessed within routine blood testing, posing a challenge
for the testâs clinical utility. In contrast, our model is only based on routine laboratory markers and even performs comparable
to models that integrate knowledge about smoking status or smoking history24,25.
As cohorts were enriched with patients diagnosed with chronic liver disease, the better performance of our model in liver
cancer might originate from an improved differential diagnosis. Interestingly, ALT and AST are not picked up as important
markers for liver cancer either, which might also be tied to the model trying to differentiate from chronic liver disease cases in
the control set. Analogous, the addition of cases with chronic bowel and lung disease could prove helpful in the colorectal and
lung cancer setting, respectively.
The SHAP analysis in Figure 3 depicts the contributions of important laboratory markers to the normalized LR on the
cohort level. In addition, we provide the relative contributions of laboratory markers to model prediction on the individual
level as waterfall plots in Supplementary Figure S2 for two selected cases: (1) a liver cancer case with only four OoR markers
(total CO2, lymphocytes (%), hemoglobin, and hematocrit, Supplementary Figure S2a), of which total CO2 and hematocrit are
the only 2 of the 15 laboratory markers with highest impact on model prediction (Figure 3b), and a control case with 18 OoR
markers (Supplementary Figure S2b), both correctly classified by the model with a high (> 0.8) and low (â¼0) risk, respectively.
These example cases illustrate the importance of considering the measurements of a range of markers together to achieve
optimal risk assessment.
In this work, we have focused on CBC and CMP blood tests as availability of complete lipid panel blood tests was limited
in our cohorts. While lipid panel use is less common in Europe, it is more frequently ordered in the US. In fact, we expect
its integration into our risk models to further improve cancer risk assessment by contributing complementary information on
physiological or pathological status.
To avoid potential harm resulting from unnecessary follow-up procedures, differential life expectancy, e.g., as a result of
competing comorbidities, needs to be taken into account30. This is of particular importance, as chronic diseases may increase
the risk of complications from biopsies and cancer treatment. While we have focused on prioritizing patients for screening
eligibility, allowing clinicians to discuss with patients who have been predicted to be at increased risk to conduct follow-up
screening procedures as early as possible, we plan to investigate different risk grading and threshold approaches that may be
applied in dependence of the presence/absence of certain comorbidities.
Similarly, it would be of great value if we could explore the contributions of laboratory markers with respect to cancer stage.
Unfortunately, we did not have access to a cohort-linked cancer registry and, therefore, lack information on cancer stage. In the
future, we anticipate such an analysis to open up the possibility to develop cancer risk prediction models that also provide an
assessment of cancer progress.
Methods
Study selection
We created a cohort of individuals diagnosed with malignant neoplasms of colorectal, liver or lung, or had no confirmed
diagnosis of any malignant neoplasm, within the period from 2017 to 2021. We further enriched the cohort by considering
additional patients who are diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and/or chronic liver disease but have no personal history
8/15
or a novel cancer diagnosis during the aforementioned period. The cohort was created using the Prognos FactorÂ® platform,
and the corresponding patient records were obtained from Prognos Health. The patient records include the laboratory marker
measurements (blood or urine based) from various encounters as well as CPT31 and ICD-10 codes32 from claims. ICD-10 codes
of patients were used as surrogate for the diagnosis for selecting patients in this study. All the records obtained correspond to
an anonymized healthcare provider in the US.
Screening-based cohorts
To create cohorts for the pre-screening scenario, we utilized the medical claims data to select the patients and their visits that
correspond to a screening procedure. Table 1 lists the CPT and ICD-10 codes used for each cancer type. If screening-related
codes were not reported for a patient, we used diagnostic procedure codes (listed in Table 1 as well).

Table 1. Screening and diagnosis relevant CPT and ICD-10 codes used for patient selection and assignment of diagnosis labels
for each cancer.
For each patient in the screening cohorts, we next determined if the patient had a positive cancer diagnosis. Although we
used ICD-10 codes to select patients for the study from the Prognos FactorÂ® platform, we recognized that the use of ICD-10
codes as confirmed diagnosis may not be sufficiently reliable33. Therefore, we ensured that at least one additional CPT or
ICD-10 code associated with cancer diagnosis and/or therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) is present after diagnosis.
Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c show the respective consort flow diagrams for each cancer. The screening cohorts for each cancer type as
described above correspond to the first cell in the flow diagram for each cancer.
For patients with a positive cancer diagnosis, we only considered the records from visits within 12 months prior to the visit
associated with the screening/diagnostic procedure. This ensured that the records all had a cancer diagnosis within the next 12
months. For patients with no cancer, we only considered records for which there are subsequent records available. For each cell
in the consort flow diagrams, both the aggregate patient and record counts are shown.
To be consistent with the pre-screening scenario, we next identified the records of all selected patients between the age of
40 and 89, with no prior diagnosis of cancer. The laboratory markers obtained at each visit are tied to the underlying conditions
that were diagnosed or monitored and, hence, the number and type of markers varied significantly, e.g., from a single marker to
all the markers in CBC and CMP. Thus, we only considered visits with at least 18 markers for our analysis and discarded all
other visits. While this approach potentially results in some data loss, it helps avoid the machine learning model to overfit to
the specific markers measured. Note that CBC and CMP also include derived markers such as BUN-creatinine ratio which, if
missing in the records, are computed using the reported BUN and creatinine values. Similarly, blood-count markers and their
percentage markers were computed if either one was not reported.
We subsequently enriched the resulting cohorts by including records of additional patients between the age of 40 and 89
who have no history of cancer and no cancer diagnosis within the next 12 months. While this step enriched the data for model
development, more importantly, it also incorporated individuals who are eligible for screening but may not have gone through
screening within the period considered in this study. We note that the number of patients (records) that were used to enrich each
cancer cohort is not the same in the consort flow diagram. This is primarily due to the fact that there are patients that have gone
through a screening procedure for one or more cancers but not all.

Data preparation and pre-processing
Given all the patients and their records in the enriched screening cohorts, we next split the data into development and validation
cohorts in a 2:1 ratio, stratified by age, sex, and diagnosis. We then performed additional steps to enrich the development
cohort that may assist in training a robust model as well as in cleaning the validation cohort to remove any ambiguous records.
Specifically, we filter out patient records that correspond to severe/acute infection such as systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, and/or septic shock, since they can result in significant change in CBC and CMP marker levels and
may not be relevant in the pre-screening scenario. We also enriched the development cohort by adding newly diagnosed cancer
patients whose records do not include a visit associated with any of the screening codes.
Given the development and validation cohorts, we normalized the distributions of biomarker values by subtracting their
median and dividing by their inter-quartile distance (IQD). In addition, we transformed the distributions of the following
markers to the logarithmic (log10) scale prior to their normalization: alanine aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase
(ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, creatinine, erythrocyte distribution width (RDW), glucose, leukocytes,
lymphocytes, neutrophils, and urea nitrogen. Note that the pre-processing parameters (i.e., median and IQD values) for all
markers were only computed on the development cohort, and the same parameter values were then applied to the validation
cohort.
Deep Profiler
Given the pre-processed development cohort, we employed a deep neural network called Deep Profiler34 to train models for
each of the three cancer scenarios. This method has previously been applied to train models to predict a severity progression
risk score for COVID-19 patients based on biomarkers (age and nine blood markers) obtained at the time of admission34,35.
Furthermore, it was demonstrated to be robust to marker missingness as well as competitive to other methods such as a logistic
regression and boosted forests.
The Deep Profiler model builds on a variational autoencoder architecture36, and consists of three main networks: an encoder
for extracting prominent features represented in a latent space, a decoder for reconstructing the input data to ensure data fidelity
of the latent feature representation, and, finally, a multi-label classifier network, which is trained to estimate the ordinal risk
score. Use of autoencoders to deal with robustness to missing data has been demonstrated to be effective37,38.
In this work, we use the same Deep Profiler architecture for each of the three cancer models, with a symmetric encoder-
decoder structure, each comprising of blocks of three fully connected layers with 32 kernels. Each fully connected layer in the
encoder is followed by a batch normalization and LeakyReLU (0.2), and each fully connected layer in the decoder is followed
by batch normalization and ReLU. Network parameters were learned using the ADAM optimizer with an initial learning rate of
10-4. The training loss is a combination of reconstruction loss (only applied to corresponding input features whose values are
not missing), VAE regularization loss and binary cross entropy loss based on the patientâs diagnosis.
Prediction uncertainty using Deep Profiler ensembles
While the VAE helps adding robustness to data missingness, undesirable biases may still be present due to the patient
population/sampling. To this end, we trained an ensemble of Deep Profiler models. Given the ensemble of models, a confidence
interval for the risk score (output of the sigmoid layer) is computed. Each model is trained on different subsets of the data,
accounting for variations in the acquisition protocols across hospitals, availability of various biomarkers, measurement methods
used to assess the biomarker as well as biomarker measurements such as laboratory values, age range, comorbidities, etc. In
this study, for each cancer scenario, we used an ensemble of ten Deep Profiler models.
Estimation of likelihood ratios
Given the patient biomarker data and computed confidence interval over the risk score, the next key step is to present this
information such that it can be easily interpreted and acted upon. To this end, we used the risk score and confidence interval to
identify the subgroup of patients in the development cohort with similar scores. As a result, we obtained a âsimilar patient
cohortâ (a.k.a. patient cohort with similar risk scores) in addition to the development cohort. We then computed the pre- and
post-test odds for the patient to have the disease and, subsequently, calculated the likelihood ratio. This can be done separately
for each medical condition. Figure 6 below shows one way of presenting this information to the clinician.
Subgroup analysis based on comorbidities
We used phecodes21 to analyze comorbidities in each of the cohorts. Phecodes are manually curated groups of ICD-10 codes
that are clinically meaningful and relevant to research. They have been widely applied in phenome-wide association studies
but, more recently, were also used for rapid electronic health record phenotyping39,40. For the colorectal, liver and lung
cancer cohorts, we censored all ICD-10 codes assigned after the date of diagnosis and only mapped the codes assigned before
diagnosis to phecodes. This ensured the identification of clinical comorbidities prior to a cancer diagnosis. For control cohorts,
we mapped all of the ICD-10 codes recorded to phecodes. Subsequently, we compared the counts of individuals with each
12/15

phecode in the control group against each of the pre-diagnosis cancer cohorts and identified significantly different phecodes, or
comorbidities, based on Fisherâs exact tests. Finally, we ranked the most significant comorbidities with at least 50 individuals in
both the cancer and the control cohort ranked for subgroup analysis and evaluated the respective Deep Profiler models in those
subgroups.
