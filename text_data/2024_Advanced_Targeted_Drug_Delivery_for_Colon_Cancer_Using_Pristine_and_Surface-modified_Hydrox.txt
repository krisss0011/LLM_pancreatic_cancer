ABSTRACT: Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANs) have emerged as a promising candidate for targeted drug 
delivery in the treatment of colon cancer, a disease that remains one of the leading causes of cancer-
related deaths globally. In this study, we synthesized and characterized HANs for their potential use as drug 
delivery vehicle for anticancer drugs specifically targeting colon cancer treatment. Through various in vitro 
assays, including drug loading efficiency, release kinetics, we demonstrated that HANs exhibit efficient 
drug loading capacity, and sustained release behavior, which could collectively contribute to enhanced 
therapeutic outcomes against colon cancer cells. The findings highlight the potential of HANs to serve as 
a versatile platform for the targeted drug delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, offering a novel approach 
that could improve treatment efficacy while minimizing side effects due to biocompatibility of the 
particles. Future research should focus on in vivo studies and clinical translation to further validate the 
potential of HANs in cancer therapy as drug carrier. 
Keywords: Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, drug delivery, colon cancer, nanotechnology, targeted therapy. 
1. Introduction 
  Colon cancer is one of the most prevalent and 
deadly forms of cancer worldwide, representing 
a significant public health challenge. Despite 
advances in medical treatments, including 
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, 
the prognosis for advanced-stage colon cancer 
remains poor. Conventional chemotherapy often 
lacks specificity, leading to systemic toxicity and 
adverse 
side 
effects, 
which 
limits 
its 
effectiveness. These challenges underscore the 
urgent need for more targeted and efficient drug 
delivery systems that can selectively attack 
cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. 
  Nanotechnology has revolutionized the field of 
cancer therapy by offering innovative solutions 
to enhance drug delivery and therapeutic 
outcomes. 
Nanoparticles 
have 
gained 
considerable attention due to their ability to 
improve 
the 
solubility, 
colloidal 
stability, 
biocompatibility and bioavailability of anticancer 
drugs. Among the various types of nanoparticles 
explored, biocompatible and biodegradable 
materials are especially attractive for clinical 
applications. The ability to design nanoparticles 
with 
specific 
surface 
properties 
and 
functionalization allows for targeted delivery, 
reducing off-target effects and improving the 
therapeutic index. 
  Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, which mimic the 
mineral component of bone, have emerged as a 
promising 
candidate 
for 
drug 
delivery 
applications 
due 
to 
their 
excellent 
biocompatibility, bioactivity, and ability to be 
functionalized for targeted therapy. HANs 
possess a porous structure that can be used to 
load and release drugs in a controlled manner, 
making them particularly suitable for delivering 
chemotherapeutic agents directly to cancer cells. 
Previous 
studies 
have 
demonstrated 
the 
potential of HANs in various biomedical 
applications, including bone regeneration and 
cancer 
therapy. 
However, 
their 
specific 
application in colon cancer treatment remains 
underexplored. 
  The objective of this study is to investigate the 
efficacy of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles as a 
targeted drug delivery system for colon cancer 
therapy. By characterizing the physicochemical 
properties of HANs, assessing their drug loading 
capacity, and evaluating their cytotoxic effects on 
colon cancer cells, we aim to demonstrate their 
potential as a novel therapeutic platform that 
could enhance the precision and effectiveness of 
cancer treatment while minimizing harmful side 
effects. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Synthesis of Hydroxyapatite Nanoparticles 
  Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were synthesized 
using modified wet chemical precipitation 
method. In this process, calcium nitrate 
tetrahydrate (Ca(NO₃)₂·4H₂O) and diammonium 
hydrogen phosphate ((NH₄)₂HPO₄) were used as 
the 
calcium 
and 
phosphate 
precursors, 
respectively. Initially, a 0.4 M solution of calcium 
nitrate was prepared in deionized water and 
heated to 70°C under continuous stirring. 
Simultaneously, 
a 
0.35 
M 
solution 
of 
diammonium 
hydrogen 
phosphate 
was 
prepared. The phosphate solution was then 
slowly added dropwise to the calcium nitrate 
solution while maintaining constant stirring at 
1000 rpm. The pH of the reaction mixture was 
adjusted to 10 using base solution ammonium 
hydroxide. The reaction was allowed to proceed 
for 2 h at 70°C, after which the precipitate 
formed was allowed to age overnight at room 
temperature. The resulting nanoparticles were 
collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 
min, followed by multiple washes with deionized 
water and ethanol to remove any unreacted 
precursors and by-products. The particles were 
then dried at 80°C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. 
Finally, the dried HANs were calcined at 500°C for 
3 h to improve crystallinity and remove any 
remaining organic residues. 
2.2 PEGylation of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles 
  PEGylation of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles was 
done using a modified known procedure. To 
PEGylate 
hydroxyapatite 
nanoparticles, 
a 
5mg/mL concentration solution of methoxy 
polyethylene glycol was prepared by dissolving in 
deionized 
water. 
Equimolar 
(1.0M) 
N-
Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-
dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) were 
added to this solution and stirred at room 
temperature for 30 min to activate the carboxyl 
groups 
of 
the 
mPEG. 
Hydroxyapatite 
nanoparticles were dispersed in deionized water 
by sonication for 15 min and then the mPEG 
solution was added dropwise to this suspension 
while stirring vigorously. After 24h of PEGylation 
reaction, PEGylated HANs were separated by 
centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, 
followed by washing three times each with 
deionized water and ethanol to remove 
unreacted mPEG and by-products. Finally, the 
PEGylated nanoparticles were dried at 60°C 
under vacuum for 24 h to get the final product. 
2.3 Characterization of Hydroxyapatite 
Nanoparticles 
  The synthesized HANs and PEG-HANs were 
characterized using a variety of techniques to 
determine their physicochemical properties. 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was 
used to analyze the morphology and size of the 
HANs. Samples for TEM analysis was prepared by 
dispersing 1mg of the nanoparticles in 15mL of 
absolute ethanol and placed a drop on a carbon-
coated copper grid, followed by drying on air. The 
surface charge of the HANs and PEG-HANs were 
measured using zeta potential analysis to ensure 
the PEGylation on the surface and assess the 
stability of particles 
in suspension. The 
nanoparticles (0.1 mg) were dispersed in 20 mL 
deionized water and analyzed the surface zeta 
potential at room temperature. 
2.4 Drug Loading and Release Studies 
  The anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was 
loaded onto the HANs and PEG-MSNs using a 
simple adsorption method. 10mg of particles 
was dispersed in 1mL of 0.5 mg/mL DOX solution 
by vortexing for 5 min and then stirred for 24 h 
at 
room 
temperature. 
Then 
drug-loaded 
particles were separated by centrifugation, 
washed two times with PBS (pH 7.4) to remove 
any unbound drug, the supernatants were kept 
for drug loading calculations. The drug loading 
efficiency was calculated by measuring the 
concentration of the free drug in the 
supernatant using UV-Vis spectroscopy at the 
characteristic absorption wavelength (480nm) of 
the drug doxorubicin in a microplate reader. In 
vitro drug release studies were conducted under 
different 
pH 
environments. 
Drug-loaded 
particles were suspended in phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and placed in a shaking 
water bath at 37°C. At predetermined time 
intervals, samples were withdrawn, centrifuged, 
and the supernatant was analyzed for drug 
concentration using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The 
cumulative drug release was calculated and 
plotted as a function of time. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Characterization of HANs and PEG-HANs 
  The synthesized hydroxyapatite nanoparticles 
were characterized in detail to confirm their 
morphology 
and 
structural 
properties. 
Transmission Electron Microscopy was used to 
assess the size, shape, and surface structure of 
the nanoparticles. TEM images revealed that the 
HANs were predominantly spherical in shape 
with an average diameter ranging between 60-70 
nm as shown in figure 1A. The nanoparticles 
demonstrated a uniform size distribution, 
indicating a controlled and consistent synthesis 
process. In addition to shape and size, high-
magnification TEM images showed that the 
surface of the HANs was smooth and well-
defined, with no significant agglomeration, 
which further confirmed the successful synthesis 
and stabilization of the nanoparticles. 
  Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and PEGylated 
hydroxyapatite nanoparticles revealed surface 
zeta potential -20 mV and +30 mV respectively as 
shown in Figure 1B. The negative zeta potential 
of -20 mV for the unmodified HANs is primarily 
attributed to the presence of phosphate groups 
on the nanoparticle surface, which impart a 
negative 
charge 
under 
physiological 
pH 
conditions. This negative surface charge plays a 
crucial role in colloidal stability, as it induces 
electrostatic 
repulsion 
between 
particles, 
preventing aggregation and ensuring that the 
nanoparticles remain well-dispersed in aqueous 
suspension. The moderately high negative zeta 
potential suggests that the HANs have good 
colloidal stability, reducing the likelihood of 
agglomeration, which is essential for their 
effectiveness in biomedical applications. In 
contrast, 
the 
PEGylated 
hydroxyapatite 
nanoparticles exhibited a positive zeta potential 
of +30 mV, which can be attributed to the 
successful grafting of mPEG chains onto the 
nanoparticle surface. PEGylation alters the 
surface chemistry of the nanoparticles, likely by 
masking the negatively charged phosphate 
groups and introducing a net positive charge. The 
shift to a positive charge is indicative of 
successful PEG conjugation, which improves the 
hydrophilicity of the nanoparticles and enhances 
their colloidal stability. This is especially 
important for biomedical applications, as 
PEGylation increases circulation time in vivo and 
reduces the likelihood of opsonization by 
immune cells, promoting prolonged circulation 
and better therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the 
positive zeta potential of the PEG-HANs 
facilitates potential interactions with negatively 
charged biomolecules or cell membranes, which 
could enhance cellular uptake and targeted drug 
delivery.

3.2 Drug Loading Efficiency and Release Profile 
  The drug loading efficiency of hydroxyapatite 
nanoparticles 
(HANs) 
and 
PEGylated 
hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (PEG-HANs) was 
determined to be 78% and 89%, respectively, 
indicating the high capacity of both systems for 
drug adsorption. The porous structure and large 
surface area of the nanoparticles provide ample 
binding sites for the drug molecules. PEGylation 
further enhances the loading efficiency of HANs 
by improving their surface properties and 
hydrophilicity, facilitating better interaction 
between the drug and the nanoparticles. This 
higher efficiency in PEG-HANs can be attributed 
to the PEG chains, which create a favorable 
surface environment for drug interaction and 
retention. 
In vitro drug release studies revealed a distinct 
pH-dependent release behavior in both systems, 
with significantly greater drug release occurring 
at pH 5.5 compared to pH 7.4. This indicates that 
both HANs and PEG-HANs respond effectively to 
acidic 
conditions, 
mimicking 
the 
tumor 
microenvironment, while exhibiting slower drug 
release at physiological pH (7.4). The biphasic 
release pattern observed in both cases includes 
an initial burst release followed by a sustained 
release phase. At pH 5.5, drug release was more 
rapid in both nanoparticle types due to the 
accelerated degradation of the nanoparticles 
under acidic conditions, which facilitates drug 
diffusion from the matrix. 
  Comparing the release profiles, PEG-HANs 
demonstrated a more controlled and prolonged 
drug release compared to HANs, both at pH 5.5 
and pH 7.4. The PEGylation provides a stabilizing 
effect that slows down nanoparticle degradation 
and drug release, allowing for a more sustained 
and uniform release over time. At pH 5.5, the 
release from PEG-HANs was still substantial but 
more 
controlled, 
further 
indicating 
the 
modulatory role of PEG chains in nanoparticle 
stability and drug diffusion. This slower, 
sustained 
release 
is 
advantageous 
for 
maintaining therapeutic drug levels over a longer 
period, especially in tumor environments, 
reducing 
the 
need 
for 
frequent 
drug 
administration and potentially improving patient 
outcomes.

and PEG-HANs. drug release profile for HANs at pH 5.5 & 7.4

(right). 
  Overall, the pH-triggered drug release observed 
in HANs and PEG-HANs highlights their suitability 
as drug delivery systems, particularly for cancer 
therapy. The enhanced drug loading capacity, 
along with the controlled release behavior in 
response to acidic conditions, demonstrates the 
potential of these systems for targeted drug 
delivery, minimizing off-target effects and 
ensuring prolonged therapeutic efficacy. PEG-
HANs, in particular, offer a promising platform for 
long-term drug release with better control over 
drug diffusion and nanoparticle stability. 
4. Conclusion 
  This 
study 
demonstrates 
the 
successful 
synthesis and application of hydroxyapatite 
nanoparticles and PEGylated hydroxyapatite 
nanoparticles as efficient drug delivery systems 
for colon cancer therapy. Both pristine and 
surface 
modified 
nanoparticles 
exhibited 
excellent physicochemical properties, including 
uniform size distribution, high surface area, and 
colloidal stability. PEGylation further enhanced 
drug loading capacity (89% for PEG-HANs vs. 78% 
for HANs) and improved hydrophilicity. In vitro 
drug release studies showed pH-sensitive 
behavior, with significantly higher release in 
acidic conditions (pH 5.5), mimicking the tumor 
microenvironment, while PEG-HANs offered 
more controlled, sustained release. These 
findings highlight the potential of HANs and PEG-
HANs as targeted, pH and enzyme-responsive 
drug delivery systems with improved therapeutic 
efficacy, biocompatibility and reduced toxicity, 
paving the way for future preclinical and clinical 
investigations in colon cancer treatment.
