Abstract 
Proton therapy offers significant advantages due to its unique physical and biological properties, 
particularly the Bragg peak, enabling precise dose delivery to tumors while sparing healthy tissues. 
However, the clinical implementation is challenged by the oversimplification of the relative 
biological effectiveness (RBE) as a fixed value of 1.1, which does not account for the complex 
interplay between dose, linear energy transfer (LET), and biological endpoints. Lack of 
heterogeneity control or the understanding of the complex interplay may result in unexpected 
adverse events and suboptimal patient outcomes.  On the other hand, expanding our knowledge of 
variable tumor RBE and LET optimization may provide a better management strategy for 
radioresistant tumors.  
This review examines recent advancements in LET calculation methods, including analytical 
models and Monte Carlo simulations. The integration of LET into plan evaluation is assessed to 
enhance plan quality control. LET-guided robust optimization demonstrates promise in minimizing 
high-LET exposure to organs at risk, thereby reducing the risk of adverse events.  
Dosimetric seed spot analysis is discussed to show its importance in revealing the true LET-related 
effect upon the adverse event initialization by finding the lesion origins and eliminating the 
confounding factors from the biological processes. Dose-LET volume histograms (DLVH) are 
discussed as effective tools for correlating physical dose and LET with clinical outcomes, enabling 
the derivation of clinically relevant dose-LET volume constraints without reliance on uncertain 
RBE models. Based on DLVH, the dose-LET volume constraints (DLVC)-guided robust 
optimization is introduced to upgrade conventional dose-volume constraints-based robust 
optimization, which optimizes the joint distribution of dose and LET simultaneously.  
In conclusion, translating the advances in LET-related research into clinical practice necessitates 
a better understanding of the LET-related biological mechanisms and the development of clinically 
relevant LET-related volume constraints directly derived from the clinical outcomes. Future 
research is needed to refine these models and conduct prospective trials to assess the clinical 
benefits of LET-guided optimization on patient outcomes. 
 
 
 
 
Introduction 
Radiation therapy (RT) is a standard treatment option used for 50-75% of cancer patients (1-3). 
Over recent decades, proton therapy has seen significant technological advancements and 
increased clinical applications(4,5). The proton beam is characterized by its Bragg peak, which 
has a sharp dose fall-off after the target. This characteristic allows proton therapy to achieve a 
lower entrance to peak dose ratio, improved dose conformality to the target and enhanced dose 
protection to organs at risk (OARs) compared to conventional photon therapy(6-13).  
Despite the dosimetric benefits, proton therapy faces a major challenge of relative biological 
effectiveness (RBE) (14-19). In contrast to photons, protons impart most of their energy over a 
short distance, and thus, induce high linear energy transfer (LET) near the distal end of the Bragg 
Peak. Hence, the biological effect of proton therapy should be determined by both dose and LET 
(and possibly other factors) (14,15,20-23). Various studies on in vitro cell experiments(24,25) 
show that RBE increases with elevated LET, while clinical outcome data are less clear regarding 
the impact of LET on RBE(26-39). An RBE >1.1 for adverse events (AEs) associated with higher 
LET within OARs has been reported for rib fracture(40), rectal bleeding(41), mandible 
osteoradionecrosis(42,43), brain necrosis(26,28,34,44), and late-phase pulmonary changes(29) in 
cancer patients treated with proton therapy. An improved understanding of the relationship 
between physical dose, LET, and AEs in proton therapy planning is greatly needed to improve 
treatment planning.  
Several phenomenological and mechanistic RBE models have been developed to calculate RBE 
from LET and physical dose (45-54). However, systematic evaluations have shown that in vitro 
RBE predictions can vary greatly across different models (55). This significant variability is 
largely due to the use of tissue-specific α/β ratios in these models, which themselves can have 
significant parameter uncertainties (46,56). Moreover, substantial discrepancies have been 
reported between in vitro and in vivo RBE results (24). Since outcomes from clonogenic assays 
do not necessarily reflect the clinical responses of cancer patients undergoing proton therapy, 
current RBE models are hindered by considerable biological and parametric uncertainties, limiting 
the clinical application of LET. 
In clinical practice, a fixed RBE value of 1.1 represents higher cell-killing effect compared to 
photons. Proton therapy planning typically relies solely on dose calculations and overlooks critical 
LET information as well as variable RBE of tumors based on histology and fraction size(17,18). 
This oversimplification has adversely affected the efficacy of proton therapy, leading to 
unexpected AEs that place additional burdens on the healthcare system and increase financial costs 
(20,57-59). Therefore, there is an urgent need to incorporate LET considerations into plan 
optimization and evaluation to reduce AEs. 
In this paper, we first review and summarize the current research on LET calculation, LET-guided 
plan evaluation, and LET-guided plan optimization. Then, we discussed the most recent 
developments in LET-related AE studies, with particular focuses on dosimetric seed spot analysis, 
dose-LET volume histogram (DLVH), and how use dose LET volume constraint-based robust 
optimization is used prospectively to adjust the dose and LET distribution simultaneously 
potentially to minimize the incidence rates of AEs.  
 
LET calculation 
Analytical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations are two main methods to calculate the LET. 
The analytical LET calculation methods(47,60-67) have been used in clinical practice owing to 
their high efficiency, acceptable computational accuracy, and other historical reasons. One-
dimensional LET models(45,60,61) assumed uniform lateral LET(64-66). Three-dimensional LET 
calculation models considered lateral LET variations(64-66). Monte Carlo (MC) simulations (68-
73) typically offer greater accuracy than analytical methods, especially in inhomogeneous 
geometries, but they require significantly longer computation times, particularly when general-
purpose MC algorithms(69,74-76) are used. Fast MC codes(77-83) have been developed and 
clinically implemented, speeding up proton dose calculations using simplified physics models, 
GPU acceleration or combined. Moreover, commercial treatment planning systems like RayStation 
(RaySearch Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden) (84) and Eclipse (Varian Medical Systems, Palo 
Alto, CA, USA) (85,86) now feature fast MC capabilities for routine dose calculations(87-90). 
However, despite the progress in MC-based robust optimization (91,92) and robustness 
evaluation(93-95), LET calculations based on fast MC have yet to be incorporated into any 
commercial TPSs for clinical use. Recently, the deep learning-based dose and LET calculation 
engines were also proposed (96,97). 
 
LET-guided plan evaluation  
Studies have found a strong correlation between high dose and high LET distribution in OARs and 
AEs(42,43). The lack of accountability of variable and high LET distributions in clinical practice 
may result in severe AEs and undesirable patient outcomes in proton therapy. LET-guided 
dosimetric evaluation has become more common in proton therapy centers, serving as a biological 
effect evaluation tool for intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans (98,99). A recent 
survey showed that 16 of 25 European proton centers called for more retrospective or prospective 
outcome studies, investigating the effect of variable RBEs induced by high LET, and 18 centers 
called for LET and RBE calculation and visualization tools(100). Typically, LET distributions of 
IMPT treatment plans are generated through analytical calculations or Monte Carlo simulations 
for further review. To assess the biological effects of an IMPT plan, physicians or physicists may 
examine areas where high doses and high LET overlap, aiming to minimize such overlaps in 
critical structures, or they may analyze the biological dose distribution based on dose and LET 
using various RBE models. In some centers, like the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, LET-guided plan 
evaluation is now a routine process for all patients undergoing IMPT, while at other centers, LET 
evaluation and optimization are performed on a more ad-hoc basis. 
 
LET-guided plan optimization  
MC simulations and experiments on water phantom have shown that similar dose distributions can 
lead to significantly different LET distributions(101). Therefore, during treatment planning, it is 
necessary to optimize LET to reduce potential AE risks (102,103). Building on top of dose 
optimization algorithms, various LET/RBE-guided plan optimization approaches have been 
developed. Some of these algorithms directly use LET in the objective function(25,104-107), 
whereas others use LET-related terms indirectly in the optimization process(15,106,108,109). 
However, in LET-guided optimization, it is crucial to balance the trade-off between the LET and 
dose distributions during the optimization process to ensure that optimizing LET does not 
compromise overall plan quality (110). 
Robust optimization (RO) is common in proton therapy(87,111-116). Proton therapy is highly 
sensitive to range and setup uncertainties, especially IMPT (117-121), and RO can generate robust 
plans by accounting for either the voxel-wise or objective-wise worst-case scenarios during 
optimization (11,12,106,112,122-140). LET-guided robust optimization has also been developed, 
which generally incorporates LET/RBE-related constraints for OARs in the dose-based robust 
optimization and adds additional LET/RBE-related penalty terms in the objective function 
(105,106,109,141-146). These methods have improved the LET distribution in OARs while 
maintaining comparable plan quality and robustness. 
The LET peak of proton beams occurs beyond the Bragg peak; therefore, optimizing proton beam 
angles and spot locations to deposit the LET peak at less hazardous regions while keeping the dose 
peaks not moved can result in a superior LET distribution (147-153). However, most current 
optimization methods focus solely on beam weight optimization. Incorporating beam angle 
optimization may be more beneficial for treatment plans in anatomically complex regions, but 
beam angle optimization will significantly increase the computation time (104,109,146). 
Additionally, increasing the number of beams can also optimize LET distribution in some patients 
(31,154). Spot-scanning proton arc therapy (SPArcT) with infinite beams can achieve superior 
dose and LET target conformity(155). However, further research is needed to establish its clinical 
advantages (156-159). 
 
Studying LET-related clinical outcomes 
Two main approaches are currently used in studying LET-related clinical outcomes. One approach 
is voxel-based analysis, which compares regions exhibiting AEs with a matched healthy region. 
(26,28,30,31,160-162). The second approach is to study AEs at the organ level, which involves a 
population-based analysis that establishes a relationship between the epidemiological probability 
of complications and the treatment modality, whether the difference involves photon or proton 
therapy. (29,37,43) 
In the first approach, individual voxels are utilized as data points for analysis. The potential 
correlation between clinical outcomes (such as whether a voxel is damaged) and both dose and 
LET was investigated. This approach was based on two fundamental assumptions: (1) all damaged 
voxels are a result of dosimetric effects, namely dose and LET; (2) within the AE regions of the 
same patients, voxels are considered to be independent of one another. However, these assumptions 
are not universally applicable. Clinical observations suggest that the AE region will expand/shrink 
over time because of biological processes. Voxels in one single lesion are not fully independent 
from each other. In addition, the potential volume effect is not considered in this approach. The 
established normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) is at voxel-level and only considers the 
dose and/or LET values. 
In the second approach, organ-level NTCP is established by comparing clinical outcome 
differences between photon and proton patient cohorts. Although there are indications of increased 
RBE with protons, the quantification is solely based on dose-volume metrics. The precise 
contribution from LET is challenging to assess, not only due to the absence of meaningful LET 
quantification at the organ level, but also because LET is highly heterogeneous. Its distribution 
within the organ and its relation to dose distribution matter. 
 
Novel approaches for LET-based outcome studies 
Dose-LET volume histogram in the organ-level adverse event analysis  
Dose-LET volume histogram (DLVH) is a novel tool for studying the combined effects of the dose 
and LET on patient outcomes. As shown in Fig.1, DLVH is a cumulative volume histogram tool 
following a similar statistical concept as a dose volume histogram (DVH) (41). Different from a 
2D plot of DVH, DLVH is a 3D surface plot. Well-defined physical quantities - dose (Gy) and LET 
(keV/µm) - are constructed as two horizontal axes, whereas the third vertical dimension shows the 
normalized volume. With DLVH, well-defined physics quantities can be associated, such as dose, 
LET, and volume of OARs with AEs. Clinically relevant dose-LET volume constraints (DLVCs) 
can be obtained(41) without the inclusion of RBE models(41) to bypass the uncertainties in the 
current RBE models.  
The DLVH approach offers several advantages: 1) It accounts for the volume effect, beyond just 
the numerical values of dose and LET; 2) It is possible to establish the relation of outcome versus 
the DLVH index, V(d, l), the specific volume having both a certain dose and a certain LET. Thus, 
the interplay of dose and LET distributions within the organ will be considered; 3) Instead of 
incorporating assumed dose-LET relations as variables into the regression analysis, it is possible 
to derive the dose-LET relations based on patterns observed from the regression analysis; and 4) 
DLVH maintains the integrity of LET information. DLVH analysis allows one to use patient cohort 
data at the organ level while precisely investigating the LET contribution. This avoids the data 
independence issue in the voxel-based analysis. 
Based on DLVH, DLVC-guided robust optimization has been proposed as an efficient method to 
simultaneously control 3D dose and LET distributions during proton therapy treatment 
planning(163). This method upgrades proton therapy treatment planning from 2D DVH-based 
(164,165) to 3D DLVH-based by considering dose, LET, and volume, and implements DLVCs as 
soft constraints in the objective function(166-168), thereby effectively reducing the number of 
potential seed spots and lowering the incidence of corresponding AEs.

DL𝑣%. (b) The projected two-dimensional DLVH of (a) and the iso-volume contour lines. The 
gray dots represent the voxels of the structure. 
 
Dosimetric seed spot analysis in the voxel-level adverse event analysis 
As mentioned above, the AE sites progress over time. Once radiation damage is initialized by dose 
and LET (i.e., radiation effect), biological processes may take over and the original AE sites may 
expand spatially(43). Analysis using all voxels, especially those low dose/LET voxels in the 
expanded AE sites, may have masked the importance of the radiation effect that triggered the AEs 
initialization (26,28,32,39,43,44,169). In addition, in such analysis(28,32,34,169,170), each voxel 
was treated as an independent data point to establish the relationship of dose and LET with the 
patient outcome. This approach breaks the fundamental assumption that “any regression methods 
require independent data points” (26). 
Recently, dosimetric seed spot analysis proposed a spatial clustering method to eliminate “noises” 
from biological processes to study AE initialization. As illustrated in Fig. 2, this approach finds 
several clusters (seed spots), each representing a spatially independent lesion origin. Although it 
is impossible to fully get rid of the biological impacts, reducing the number of data points for 
analysis and finding their independent representatives improves the data independence and reduces 
the noise from the overrepresentation of non-contributing voxels. Based on dosimetric seed spot 
analysis, some research(42,43) suggested that RBEs are underestimated in current clinical practice 
and the LET-enhancing effect is critical for AE initialization in head and neck patients.

in one head-and-neck (H&N) patient. The grey dots represent voxels of the structure. The solid 
lines are the iso-volume contour lines DL𝑣% of the DLVH. The assumed critical voxels for seed 
spot analysis are represented by the red dots, which are the highest 5% LET voxels selected from 
each dose bin within the moderate to high dose range. Potential voxels influenced by biological 
effects in in-field AE regions with low doses and low LET are enclosed within the light blue dashed 
oval. The purple dashed circle and green dashed oval respectively denote possible voxels in in-
field AE regions typically characterized by high doses, and out-of-field AE regions typically 
characterized by high LET. (b) Identification of seed spots within an AE region. The spatial 
distribution of seed spots is shown for mandibular osteoradionecrosis in a representative patient. 
Critical voxels in DLVH are identified and grouped into two seed spots, each highlighted in a 
different color. Other AE voxels are depicted in gray, while the high-dose clinical target volume 
(CTVHigh) is shown in blue. The figure is presented in DICOM coordinates. 
  
 
Conclusion 
With the development of hardware and software in proton therapy, LET-related research has 
recently made significant progress, including studies on precise LET calculation, LET-guided plan 
evaluation, LET-guided plan optimization, and LET-related patient outcomes. However, LET-
guided plan evaluation and optimization require a better understanding of the LET-related 
biological mechanisms and clinically relevant LET-related volume constraints directly derived 
from the clinical outcomes, both of which need further research.
