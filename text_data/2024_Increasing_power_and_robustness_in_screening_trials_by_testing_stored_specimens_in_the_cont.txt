Abstract (280/350 words) 
 
Background: Screening trials require large sample sizes and long time-horizons to 
demonstrate mortality reductions.  We recently proposed increasing statistical power by 
testing stored control-arm specimens, called the “Intended Effect” (IE) design.  To 
evaluate feasibility of the IE design, the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) is collecting 
blood specimens in the control-arm of the NCI Vanguard Multicancer Detection pilot 
feasibility trial.  However, key assumptions of the IE design require more investigation 
and relaxation.   
 
Methods:  We relax the IE design to (1) reduce costs by testing only a stratified sample 
of control-arm specimens by incorporating inverse-probability sampling weights, (2) 
correct for potential loss-of-signal in stored control-arm specimens, and (3) correct for 
non-compliance with control-arm specimen collections.  We also examine sensitivity to 
“unintended effects” of screening (i.e. outcome rates in screen-negatives increasing due 
to false reassurance). 
 
Results: In simulations, testing all primary-outcome control-arm specimens and a 50% 
sample of the rest maintains nearly all the power of the IE while only testing half the 
control-arm specimens.  Power remains increased from the IE analysis (versus the 
standard analysis) even if unintended effects exist.  The IE design is robust to some 
loss-of-signal scenarios, but otherwise requires retest-positive fractions that correct bias 
 
3 
at a small loss of power.  The IE can be biased and lose power under control-arm non-
compliance scenarios, but corrections correct bias and can increase power.   
 
Conclusions:   The IE design can be made more cost-efficient and robust to loss-of-
signal.  Unintended effects will not typically reduce the power gain over the standard 
trial design.  Non-compliance with control-arm specimen collections can cause bias and 
loss of power that can be mitigated by corrections.  Although promising, practical 
experience with the IE design in screening trials is necessary.

Introduction 
 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for screening tests require large sample sizes and 
long time-horizons to demonstrate mortality reductions.1–3  For example, the NHS-
Galleri Multicancer Detection (MCD) screening trial randomized 140,000 people and 
requires 8-10 years to examine cancer mortality results.4  MCD tests use a single blood 
specimen to screen for cancer at multiple organ sites simultaneously, including those 
without recommended screening, which is an exciting prospect.5,6  However, RCT data 
on the clinical benefits and harms of MCD-based screening will be unavailable for many 
years.  Yet, in the US, MCD tests are already being sold, underscoring the need to 
provide RCT evidence as soon as possible.7 
 
To increase statistical power in screening trials, we8 and others9–11 have proposed 
testing stored material among controls and comparing trial outcomes only among those 
who ever test positive, which we call the “Intended Effect” (IE) design8.  The intended 
effect of screening is that only those who test-positive at least once (“ever-positive”) 
could receive treatments which affect mortality.  In contrast, those who never test-
positive (“never-positive”) never undergo diagnostic procedures (much less treatment) 
and thus their mortality should be unaffected by screening.  Thus, removing everyone 
who likely could not be affected by screening (i.e. removing never-positives), and 
comparing outcomes only among ever-positives in both arms, can have substantially 
greater statistical power.8  An MCD RCT relying the IE design could halve the sample-
size required to attain 90% power.8

To evaluate feasibility of the IE design, the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) is 
collecting blood specimens in the control-arm of the NCI Vanguard MCD pilot feasibility 
RCT.12  Although promising, the IE design requires assumptions that have not been 
adequately investigated or relaxed. We relax the IE design to (1) reduce costs by testing 
only a stratified sampling of control-arm specimens, (2) account for potential loss-of-
signal in stored control-arm specimens, and (3) correct for non-compliance with control-
arm specimen collections.  We also examine sensitivity to “unintended effects” of 
screening (i.e. outcome rates in screen-negatives increasing due to false reassurance). 
 
 
Methods 
 
Brief review of the Intended Effect (IE) Design/Analysis 
 
Figure 1 shows a schematic of the IE analysis for an example idealized MCD trial.  The 
standard trial analysis, with 50k individuals per-arm, 2% cancer death rate, and a 
screening relative risk (RR) of 0.90 would have only 65% power. The IE design tests 
control-arm specimens and removes everyone who are never test-positive, because 
they should not be affected by screening as they receive no medical interventions (i.e., 
assumed to have “no unintended effects”), and in Figure 1 their relative risk (”RRneg”) 
equals 1.  The IE analysis focuses on the ever-positives, the only people who might 
receive medical interventions and thus benefit from screening.  The RR among ever-
 
6 
positives is RRpos=0.867, which is stronger than RR=0.90.  Importantly, the p-value for 
RRpos is 10-fold smaller than for the RR. To achieve 90% power at 𝛼=0.05, the standard 
trial would require 98k individuals per-arm versus 53k per arm for the IE design.   Hence 
the IE analysis, which focuses on RRpos and its p-value, achieves 90% power at about 
half the sample-size required by the standard analysis.   
 
Secondarily, the IE analysis also calculates the risk difference and relative risk among 
never-positives (RDneg and RRneg, respectively) to test the “no unintended effects” 
assumption, which is that RDneg =0 and RRneg =1.   
 
See Supplement for more review and notation, and discussion of ethical issues13,14. 
 
Extending the IE Analysis to only test a stratified sample of control-arm specimens 
 
Rather than testing all control-arm specimens, it is more cost-efficient to test everyone 
who experiences the primary outcome (“cases”) and a stratified random sample of the 
others (“controls”) for testing. The Supplement shows how to use observed sampling 
fractions as inverse-probability weights (IPW) to estimate the RRpos.  Stratification can 
be on any covariates collected on everyone in the control-arm to oversample people 
associated with testing ever-positive.  The more predictive the covariates are for ever-
positivity, the fewer controls would require testing.   
 
 
 
7 
Sensitivity of IE statistical power to unintended effects of screening 
 
The IE design assumes that individuals who never test positive receive no medical 
interventions and are unaffected by screening.  The “no unintended effects” assumption 
is analogous to the “exclusion restriction” in causal inference, that “never-takers” in both 
arms should experience the same outcome rates15.  However, there may be unintended 
effects of screening, such as false-reassurance in the screen-arm never-positives, who 
may skip standard of care (SOC) screens or otherwise alter their behavior to be riskier 
(RDneg<0, or equivalently, RRneg>1), and thus a negative screen inadvertently causes 
harm.   The opposite of false-reassurance is ‘non-assurance’, which could happen if 
people in the screen arm who test never-positive are not reassured and seek out extra 
screening (RDneg>0, or equivalently, RRneg<1).   
 
Power is determined by 𝛼 and the non-centrality parameter (see page 91 in16) The 
Supplement calculates the ratio increase in the non-centrality parameter for RRpos 
versus the standard RD, for any value of RDneg: 
 
 
𝑍!"#$% = $1 −𝑅𝐷&'(
𝑅𝐷
⋅𝑃(𝑀−). ⋅ 0
𝑃(𝑀+)
𝑃(𝑀+ |𝐷+)𝑃(𝑀+ |𝐷−) , 
 
 
where “RD” is the overall trial risk-difference, “P(M+)” is the probability of being ever-
positive (i.e. testing positive on any screen), “P(M-)“ is the probability of testing never-
positive, and “D+” denotes experiencing the trial outcome (e.g. cancer death).  The 
 
8 
radical is >1 because its numerator is a weighted average of the 2 factors in the 
denominator.  Thus 𝑍!"#$% > 1 and the IE analysis has more power than the standard 
analysis if there are no unintended effects (RDneg=0) or if there is false-reassurance in 
the screen-arm (RDneg<0).  If there were ‘non-assurance’ (RDneg>0), the IE analysis can 
still have more power than the standard analysis, although not guaranteed.  
Supplement explains how we simulated to calculate power for various scenarios. 
 
Correcting for loss-of-signal in stored control-arm specimens 
 
Stored specimens degrade over time.  There may be less positivity by testing stored 
specimens (in the control arm) versus testing fresh specimens (in the screen arm), 
which may bias RRpos or RRneg.  Degradation of stored specimens rarely (if ever) results 
in gain-of-signal, and we assume it is impossible.  The Supplement demonstrates: 
• If loss-of-signal is only differential by arm (i.e. non-differential by outcome), there is 
no bias in RRpos by substituting the observed ever-positivity as the true ever-
positivity, although there is loss of power.  An example of loss-of-signal only 
differential by arm is if the stored specimens that lose signal were a simple random 
sample of all ever-positives.  If instead false positives were more likely to have a 
weak degradable signal than true positives, then loss-of-signal is differential by 
outcome and there is bias in RRpos.   
• For RRneg, even if loss-of-signal is only differential by arm, there is bias by 
substituting the observed ever-positivity for true ever-positivity. 
 
 
9 
To correct bias, we propose also storing a portion of the specimen in the screen-arm 
(screen-arm conducts testing on fresh specimens) and retest all stored specimens that 
tested positive on the fresh specimen.  Define 𝑀5 as the observed ever-positivity 
indicator, which degrades the true M by loss-of-signal.  For simplicity, assume no gain-
of-signal is possible.  We estimate (1) the fraction of the screen-arm true-positives that 
also retest-positive (𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝑀+, 𝐷+8), and (2) the fraction of the screen-arm false-
positives that also retest-positive (𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝑀+, 𝐷−8).  These fractions account for the 
possibility that there may be more loss of signal in false-positives, which may tend to be 
weaker signals than true-positives.  We substitute retest-positivity to unbiasedly 
calculate the outcome rate in control-arm ever-positives: 
 
𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀+) = 91 + 𝑃*(𝐷−)
𝑃*(𝐷+) × 𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷−8/𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝑀+, 𝐷−8
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷+8/𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝑀+, 𝐷+8<
+)
, 
  
and thereby correct bias in RRpos.  See Supplement for derivation and demonstration of 
bias correction.  A similar calculation to correct bias in RRneg is in the Supplement.   
 
Correcting for non-compliance with specimen collections in the control-arm 
 
We focus on non-compliance in the control-arm from skipping specimen collections (we 
assume the screening test cannot be obtained outside of the trial, which is a problem for 
the standard analysis as well).  Hence non-compliance can only reduce ever-positivity.   
Note that, those who skipped screens but tested positive at any screen they attended, 
 
10 
are known to be ever-positive.  Thus we examine robustness to including those who 
both skipped screens and never tested positive at any screen they attended (i.e. those 
with unknown ever-positivity), into the never-positive table.  In this framework, non-
compliance to specimen collections is mathematically equivalent to a particularly acute 
loss-of-signal.  Thus, the results from robustness to loss-of-signal section carry-over.  
Thus, just as loss-of-signal that is only differential by arm (i.e. non-differential by 
outcome) does not cause bias, similarly non-compliance that is only differential by arm 
does not cause bias (although there is loss of power).  Similarly, just as loss-of-signal 
that is differential by outcome causes bias, non-compliance that is differential by 
outcome also causes bias.  See Supplement for more discussion. 
 
Correcting for control-arm non-compliance requires placing everyone in both arms with 
unknown ever-positivity into a third 2x2 table (see Supplement).  We do not correct 
estimates to perfect compliance in both arms, because perfect compliance is unrealistic. 
We propose that the non-compliance correction be to set the non-compliance pattern in 
the control-arm to equal that in the screen-arm.  That is, we propose to not correct for 
non-compliance in the screen-arm.  This is because it is appropriate to “penalize” 
screening if the screening test is difficult for participants to adhere to.   
 
Non-compliance that is completely non-differential cannot cause bias.  We conducted 
simulations to quantify bias and power in various control-arm non-compliance 
scenarios.

Results 
 
Efficient stratified sampling of stored control-arm specimens to test 
 
Table 1 simulated sampling of control-arm specimens with binomial sampling among 
those who develop a trial outcome and a single fraction of those who do not develop 
trial outcome.  When sampling all controls for testing provides 89-90% power, sampling 
half of the controls for testing provides 84-86% power (Table 1A), nearly the same 
power while obviating testing for half the control-arm.  If only 80% of cases could be 
tested (Table 1B), power drops from 89-90% to 87-88% when sampling 70% of the 
controls along with the 80% of cases, showing that small losses in testing of cases 
could be made up by testing more controls.  The simulations do not include sampling 
strata predictive of ever-positivity, such as cancer-status, age, or other risk-factors, 
which in principle could make the sampling plan more efficient. 
 
Unintended effects and statistical power in the IE analysis 
 
The Supplement demonstrates that the IE analysis has more power than the standard 
analysis if there are no unintended effects (RDneg=0, or equivalently, RRneg=1) or if there 
is false-reassurance in the screen-arm (RDneg<0).  But even if there were ‘non-
assurance’ (RDneg>0), the IE analysis can still have more power than the standard 
analysis.  Figure 2 plots power versus RRpos for an example MCD trial with RR=0.9, as 
ever-positivity and RRneg=1vary.  The standard analysis has only 36% power, but many 
 
12 
IE analyses achieve >90% power as RRpos becomes smaller and as ever-positivity 
decreases.  As expected, the power gain is greatest for false-reassurance 
(RRneg=1.05), then no intended effects (RRneg=1), and least gain for non-assurance 
(RRneg=0.95).   
 
The power curves are monotonic and similar for ever-positivity > 5%, and power is close 
to that of the standard analysis when RRpos =RR. However, for very small 2.5%-5% 
ever-positivity and RRpos ≈ RR, power is not monotonic at RRpos ≈ RR because the 
larger number of outcomes at RRpos ≈ RR can outweigh a stronger RRpos <RR (see 
Supplement Figure S1 for an example). 
 
 
Correcting for potential loss-of-signal from testing stored versus fresh specimens 
 
When loss-of-signal is non-differential by outcome, RRpos is unbiased with little loss in 
power at small loss-of-signal fractions of 10%, but substantial loss of power if 30% or 
more of signal were lost (Table 2A).  However,  RRneg=1 is strongly biased even at 
small loss-of-signal with highly inflated type-1 error 𝛼 (Table 2A).  When loss-of-signal is 
differential by outcome (Table 2B), bias generally ensues.  With a 20% loss-of-signal in 
non-events (and 10% in events), RRpos is substantially underestimated (0.867 to 0.80, a 
non-conservative bias). 
 
 
13 
Table 2C shows that our proposed corrections to RRpos  and RRneg=1 by using stored 
samples in the screen-arm are unbiased and testing for RRneg=1 (which is null) has 
proper type-1 error 𝛼.  However, RRpos estimation inevitably loses power, e.g. if loss-of-
signal is 10% in events and 20% in non-events, then power drops from 0.84 to 0.79. 
 
 
Correcting for non-compliance to specimen collections in the control-arm  
 
Figure S2 shows an example of correcting for arm-differential non-compliance, where 
the observed and corrected RRpos equal that under perfect compliance.  Figure S3 
shows an example of correcting for non-compliance that is differential by both arm and 
outcome, and the corrected RRpos no longer equals that under perfect compliance.  This 
is because outcome-differential non-compliance implies that ever-positivity will be 
imbalanced between arms (except at the null of RR=1, RRpos =1, and RRneg=1).   See 
Supplement for more explanation about the figures. 
 
Table 3 shows simulation results from various non-compliance scenarios.  Neither 
RRpos nor RRneg has bias under non-compliance that is non-differential, or differential by 
arm-only.  However, power for RRpos is reduced from 88% to 74-77%.  The non-
compliance correction to RRpos increases power to 82-85%, showing that even if the 
correction is not needed to reduce bias, it can reduce variance and increase power.     
 
 
14 
However, when non-compliance is differential by both arm and outcome in opposite 
directions (last 2 rows, Table 3), large bias ensues in the observed RRpos and RRneg. 
The corrections are necessary to remove bias, although note that outcome-differential 
non-compliance implies that the RRpos corrected to reflect the non-compliance pattern of 
the screen-arm will not equal the RRpos under perfect compliance. Power for RRpos 
remains high (84%) and corrected RRneg maintains 5% type-1 error.   
 
 
Discussion 
 
We demonstrated that the IE design increases power versus the standard analysis of 
screening RCTs.  However, the IE design requires assumptions that we relax and 
investigate sensitivity to.  The IE design can be made more cost-efficient by testing only 
a stratified sample of control-arm specimens.  Under false-reassurance, the power gain 
from the IE is even greater than if unintended effects did not exist.   We demonstrate 
that the IE design is naturally robust to loss-of-signal that non-differential by outcome, 
and we make it robust to loss-of-signal that is differential by outcome by incorporating 
“retest-positive” fractions from the screen-arm.  The IE is robust to non-compliance with 
control-arm specimen collections that is non-differential or differential by arm only, and 
non-compliance corrections can increase power.  But if non-compliance is differential by 
both arm and outcome, bias ensues, and corrections must be used. 
 
 
15 
The IE design reduces costs by requiring fewer participants to achieve 90% power, but 
increases costs by requiring testing of control-arm specimens.  Recruiting a participant 
for screening RCTs in the US costs roughly $1000-3000, but a screening test (without 
markup) might cost $100-300 (roughly a factor of 3-10 less).  Hence powering an RCT 
based on the IE design, which would reduce sample-size, should generally have lower 
total cost than the standard design.  In this paper, we further improve cost-efficiency of 
the IE design by testing only a stratified sample of control-arm specimens.  We found 
that at least half of control-arm specimens do not require testing to maintain nearly all 
the power.  Our simulations did not include sampling strata likely associated with ever-
positivity, such cancer-status, age or other risk-factors.  Additional strata would reduce 
further the fraction of control-arm specimens requiring testing.  Note that, if power gains 
from the IE are used to reduce sample-size, then trial investigators must commit to the 
IE analysis as the primary analysis. 
 
We showed that even if unintended effects occur, the IE analysis  still has substantially 
greater power than the standard analysis.  However, “no unintended effects” 
assumption can be test if RRneg equals 1, which is important to do.  If the RRneg 
indicates substantial false-reassurance, that indicates that screening programs must 
emphasize to screen-negatives that they must continue to get standard-of-care screens 
and not change their behavior.   
 
We demonstrate that the IE design is robust to loss-of-signal that is differential only by 
arm.  To account for loss-of-signal that is also differential by outcome, we extended the 
 
16 
IE design to also store specimens in the screen-arm to calculate “retest-positive” 
fractions that are necessary to correct for bias.  The only screen-arm stored-specimens 
that require testing are from those who test ever-positive, to examine whether their 
stored specimens “retest” ever-positive.  For MCD tests, which are rarely positive, this 
would not appreciably increase testing costs.  Because degradation of stored 
specimens rarely (if ever) results in “gain-of-signal”, we assumed it was not possible.  If 
gain-of-signal were possible, then stored screen-arm specimens from never-positives 
would also have to be tested, which would increase testing costs.  Testing only a 
stratified sample of the never-positives might suffice to correct bias. 
 
The IE design is robust to non-compliance with control-arm specimen collections that is 
non-differential or differential by arm only, but our corrections can increase statistical 
power.  Non-compliance that is differential by both arm and outcome can cause serious 
bias in the uncorrected RRpos and RRneg.  The corrections remove bias and power can 
be maintained.   
 
Conclusions 
The IE design is a promising approach to screening RCT design, but requires 
assumptions that we investigated and relaxed.  Because the IE analysis, as we define it, 
has never been used, we need experience with the design and analysis, which we will 
obtain with the NCI Vanguard MCD pilot feasibility RCT.12  If the IE analysis proves 
feasible and useful, a future large definitive randomized MCD screening trial could be 
 
17 
powered for the IE analysis as the primary analysis, which would result in large cost 
savings versus the standard design and hence make the trial more feasible to conduct.

Figure 1. Schematic of the Intended Effect (IE) analysis.  The standard trial analysis table is decomposed into 2 subtables of those who 
test negative on all screens in each arm, and those who test positive on at least one screen in each arm (note that this requires storing 
control-arm specimens for future testing).  Because those who test negative on all screens never receive treatments, there is no 
intended effect of screening for the 95,000 screen-negatives and hence RRneg exactly with 𝑝= 1 exactly.  Removing them from the 
analysis leads to the increases in power shown in the Ever-positive table, which is the Intended Effect analysis.

Table 2A/B/C.  Sensitivity to, and correcting for, loss-of-signal from testing stored specimens that are 
truly positive.  All situations set: total trial n=100,000 (50,000 in each arm),  5% chance of ever testing 
positive, 2% event rate, overall 𝑅𝑅= 0.9, RRneg=1 (i.e. no false-reassurance), RRpos=0.867, and 
testing 95% of control-arm stored specimens who experience a trial outcome and testing 50% of 
control-arm stored specimens who do not experience a trial outcome. 
 
(A) Non-differential loss-of-signal (i.e. equal loss-of-signal fraction from testing stored specimens from 
those who experience a trial outcome versus those who do not).  RRpos  is not biased by non-
differential loss-of-signal, with little loss in power at small loss-of-signal fractions of 10%.  RRneg is 
strongly biased even at 10% loss-of-signal with highly inflated type-1 error 𝛼.

from controls who do not experience a trial outcome versus controls who do experience the trial

(0.867 vs 0.81), a non-conservative bias.  If there is loss-of-signal in events, RRneg is strongly biased 
even at 10% loss-of-signal in events, with highly inflated type-1 error 𝛼.

correct RRpos  and RRneg estimates.  RRpos  and RRneg estimates are unbiased.  Testing for 𝑅𝑅&'( has 
proper type-1 error 𝛼. RRpos  estimation loses some power if loss-of-signal is 10% in events and 20% 
in non-events (power drops from 0.84 to 0.79).

Review of the Intended Effect design and analysis 
 
For all details, see Katki et al8. 
 
The standard trial analysis calculates the relative risk: 𝑅𝑅= 𝑃)(𝐷+) / 𝑃*(𝐷+),  where 𝑃$(𝐷+) is the 
observed rate of a defined trial outcome 𝐷 (e.g. death from cancer) through a fixed time, for the 
screening group 𝑖= 1, and control group 𝑖= 0.   Similarly, the trial risk difference is 𝑅𝐷= 𝑃*(𝐷+) −
𝑃)(𝐷+). 
 
For the IE analysis, we store control-group specimens for testing at some future time, which 
retrospectively reveals which control-group members would have tested positive. Let “𝑀+ " denote 
testing positive at any screen (“ever-positive”) and "𝑀−" denote not testing positive on any screen 
(“never-positive”). The IE relative risk among ever-positives is 
 
 
𝑅𝑅/%0 = 𝑃)(𝐷+ |𝑀+)
𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀+), 
 
 
and similarly the IE risk difference among ever-positives is 
 
 
𝑅𝐷/%0 = 𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀+) −𝑃)(𝐷+ |𝑀+). 
 
 
Standard software for analysis of 2x2 tables can calculate RRpos, RDpos, and their variances.  There 
can be substantially greater power to detect RRpos (or RDpos) versus RR.8  For example in Figure 1, 
power for the standard analysis is 65% but for the IE analysis is 88%.  This is because those who test 
never-positive should not have their outcome risk affected, and hence we expect that RRneg ≈ 1:   
 
 
𝑅𝑅&'( = 𝑃)(𝐷+ |𝑀−)
𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀−) = 1, 
 
 
or equivalently, 𝑅𝐷&'( = 𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀−) −𝑃)(𝐷+ |𝑀−) = 0.   
 
The intended effect of screening is that all the benefit of screening, as measured by the standard RR, 
should be concentrated in the RRpos.  Thus the RRpos will represent a stronger effect size than RR.  In 
Figure 1, RR=0.90 but RRpos =0.867.  Hence, we expect that there would be more power for RRpos 
than for RR.  In particular, the power gain for the IE analysis (assuming RRneg=1) increases 
approximately as (1- RRpos)/(1-RR) increases, that is, as the mortality reduction in ever-positives (1-
RRpos) becomes stronger than that in the overall trial (1-RR).8   
 
However, their8 power calculations are solely for RRneg=1.  However, there may be unintended effects 
of screening among the never-positives that affects their outcome risk and RRneg ≠ 1. This manuscript 
provides an expression for power allowing any value of RRneg.   
 
For example, if those testing negative in the screen-arm are informed of their test result, they may be 
falsely reassured and forgo standard-of-care screening or change their behavior (“false-
 
28 
reassurance”).  In this case, RRneg >1, i.e. screening inadvertently causes harm among screen-arm 
never-positives.  Or RRneg <1 happens if a person does not feel reassured by a negative test and 
obtains more screening (“non-assurance”). The RR combines effects in ever-positives and never-
positives to give a single population-average result, but examining RRpos and RRneg separately 
provides insight on the sources of screening effects.  While focus is primarily on RRpos, it is important 
to calculate RRneg as well.  Note that, if a trial protocol allows for blinding of participants to arm, which 
requires not returning negative results to screen-arm members, there is little reason to believe that 
those who test-negative change their behavior, and that may ensure that RRneg ≈ 1. 
 
We believe the IE design satisfies principles of ethical research as long as trial investigators are in 
true equipoise about whether the screening test can be used to save lives (see8,13 for more 
discussion).  The IE design ensures that no harm is done to the control-arm, and standard-of-care 
medical practice is actively encouraged for all study participants. The key question is whether it is 
appropriate to test the specimens of participants in the control-arm without returning the results.   
True equipoise suggests that there is no ethical imperative to return test results to control-arm 
participants, who will be encouraged to undergo standard-of-care screening.  For example, some 
HPV test screening trials have conducted HPV-testing in the control-arm without returning results to 
participants, and control-arm participants received standard of care screening (cervical cytology).14  
The trial consent form should clearly state that test results would not be returned to control-arm 
participants.  We propose storing specimens and delaying testing towards the end of the study to 
remove the possibility of acting upon individual control-arm test results.

Extending the IE analysis to incorporate stratified sampling for testing control-arm specimens 
 
The IE analysis requires calculating 𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀+), which is the rate of outcomes among control-arm 
ever-positives.  The most direct way is to test all control-arm specimens, but testing all specimens is 
costly.  Instead, it is more cost-efficient to estimate 𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀+) by testing only a stratified sample of 
control-arm specimens.  The most important stratum is having the primary outcome (i.e. those who 
are D+), as those are most likely to test ever-positive.  Among everyone else, strata could include any 
factors that are associated with test-positivity, such as cancer status, age, race, sex, smoking status, 
standard-of-care screening test results, and other risk factors.  Such factors could be identified by 
analyzing the screen-arm to identify factors associated with screen-arm ever-positivity.   
 
Assume we have S strata denoted s=1 … S each of whom tests a fraction fs of its members (for 
simplicity, presume that all specimens for that member would be tested, to definitively establish 
ever/never-positivity).  Denote stratum 1 as the stratum for testing those who are D+ in the control-
arm.  Then the total number of D+ events among ever-positives is estimated as  
 
𝐷)
E = 𝐷)
𝑓)
, 
 
where D1 is the observed number of people both D+ and ever-positive.  Note that ideally f1=1, i.e. we 
can test everyone who is D+ in the control arm, in which case, D1 is the actual number of people who 
are both D+ and ever-positive in the control-arm.  However, it is often the case that there are minor 
testing or storage issues that preclude testing everyone, and only a high fraction, such as f1=0.95, 
may be testable in practice. 
 
To calculate the estimated number of ever-positives in the screen arm, assume number Ms tests 
ever-positive in stratum s, then: 
𝑀G = 𝐷)
E + H 𝑀0
𝑓0
1
023
. 
 
Finally we estimate 𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀+) as 𝐷)
E/𝑀G. 
 
An important special case is when D+ represents cancer death.  In addition to testing everyone who 
dies of cancer, it’s clearly informative to test everyone with cancer but did not die, and they would 
form a stratum of their own.

Derivation of increase in power for 𝐑𝐃𝐩𝐨𝐬 and 𝐑𝐃 in large samples, by calculating the ratio 
increase in the non-centrality parameter 
 
Katki et al8 derived an approximation to the power gain for RDpos over the RD, assuming RDneg=0.  
They approximated power by using the variance calculated under the alternative hypothesis.  
However, calculating a proper p-value formally requires using the variance as calculated under the 
null hypothesis.16  Here we derive the power gain of RDpos over RD for any value of RDneg and we 
properly use the (pooled) variance as calculated under the null hypothesis. 
 
First, we explain why we focus on the non-centrality parameter 𝑍. The non-centrality parameter is the 
expected value of the Z-statistic under the alternative hypothesis (see page 91 in16) 
 
|𝑍| = |𝜋) −𝜋*|
𝜙
, 
 
where 𝜋i is the probability of the outcome in arm i, and 𝜙 is the pooled variance of |𝜋) −𝜋*| under the 
null.  The non-centrality parameter (and 𝛼) suffice to calculate power via the fundamental equation 
(see page 91 in16) 
 
|𝑍| = 𝑍)+7 −𝑍)+8. 
 
The non-centrality parameter for the risk difference RD is a standard calculation.  Hence, the ratio of 
the Z for RDpos and for RD suffices to define the increase in power from RDpos vs RD. 
 
We calculate the ratio of the noncentrality parameters for RDpos and RD:

demonstrates that when 𝑅𝐷&'( = 0, the 𝑍!"#$% > 1 because the radical is always >1 because the 
numerator is a weighted average of the 2 factors in the denominator.  Thus, if 𝑅𝐷&'( = 0, as 
expected, then the IE analysis has more power than the standard analysis.  If there were false-
reassurance among never-positives so that 𝑅𝐷&'( < 1, then the 𝑍!"#$% is even large than under 
𝑅𝐷&'( = 0, so power is even more increased.  If there were “non-assurance” among never-positives 
so that 𝑅𝐷&'( were sufficiently greater than 0, then the 𝑍!"#$% could be <1, implying reduced power for 
the IE analysis versus the standard analysis.

This expression is amenable to calculating the power gain for IE, by specifying 𝑃)(𝐷+) = 𝑅𝑅⋅𝑃*(𝐷+) 
and 𝑃(𝑀+). For equal arm sizes, the factors in the denominator of the radical can be written as: 
 
𝑃(𝐷+ |𝑀+) = 0.5 ⋅𝑃*(𝐷+)
𝑃(𝑀+) ⋅961 + 𝑅𝑅/%08 ⋅
𝑅𝑅&'( −𝑅𝑅
𝑅𝑅&'( −𝑅𝑅/%0
<. 
 
This factor in the braces contains the quantities related to the IE.  The power gain from the IE 
increases as the factor in the brace decreases.  That is, the power gain increases as RRneg increases, 
and as RRpos decreases relative to RR.  Katki et al8 calculated this factor, under RRneg =1, as            
(1-RR)/(1- RRpos).  The extra factor of (1+RRpos) in this equation accounts for the non-monotonic 
power behavior when RRpos is very close to RR at small ever-positivity P(M+) (as shown in Figure 2 
and an example shown in Figure S1).

Simulating screening trials to compare the standard versus the Intended Effect (IE) analysis 
 
Rather than simulating a screening trial over time, we only simulate the 2 final 2x2 tables of trial 
outcome by arm (one table each for screen-negative and for screen-positives as shown in Figure 1). 
This is because all stored samples in the control arm would be tested at a single future time after all 
screening is completed, and the IE analysis would be conducted at that time.  We assume there is an 
overall relative risk (RR) of interest that the trial has been powered to detect at that time. 
 
The simulation fixes the following parameters of the trial: 
 
1. Total trial sample size in both arms (N) 
2. Fraction of sample size that is in the control arm 
3. Probability of outcome in the control arm 
4. Trial relative risk (RR) 
These 4 are parameters needed to specify the usual power calculation for the standard analysis.  
These 4 also specify the 2x2 table for the standard trial analysis (top table in Figure 1).  Then we also 
need to specify: 
5. Probability of having at least 1 screen-positive (probability of testing ever-positive)  
6. RRneg 
7. RRpos 
These 3 are needed to define the 2x2 tables for screen-positives (the relative risk among screen-
positives 𝑅𝑅/%0) and screen-negatives (the relative risk among screen-positives 𝑅𝑅&'(). 
 
The simulation fixes the sample size in each arm in each simulation (first 2 parameters above define 
this).  The simulation first draws the numbers of people who test positive in each arm from binomial 
distributions, then draws the number of trial outcomes by the 4 combinations of arm by screening 
result also from binomial distributions.  This populates the 2 2x2 tables for screen-positives and 
screen-negatives, which are summed to make the overall 2x2 table that is the basis for the standard 
trial analysis.  We do 10,000 simulations for each parameter set.

Correcting for loss of signal in stored control arm specimens 
 
For RDpos, the only term affected by loss of signal is the control-arm outcome rate among ever-
positives, which can be expressed using Bayes Rule as 
 
𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀+) = 91 + 𝑃*(𝐷−)
𝑃*(𝐷+) × 𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷−)
𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷+)<
+)
. 
 
The last ratio is a Bayes Factor (BF), which is the only part affected by ever-positivity and thus what 
we need to estimate.  Denote M as the true ever-positivity and 𝑀5 as the ever-positivity observed 
under loss of signal.  The numerator and denominator of the BF are calculated via 
 
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷8 = 𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷) + 𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀−8𝑃*(𝑀−|𝐷), 
 
and because 𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀−8 = 0 (i.e. we assume no gain-of-signal is possible), then  
 
𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷) =
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷8
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8. 
 
If loss-of-signal were only differential by arm (i.e. non-differential by outcome, meaning 𝑃*6𝑀57𝐷, 𝑀8 =
𝑃*6𝑀57𝑀8), then 
 
𝐵𝐹= 𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷−)
𝑃* (𝑀+ |𝐷+) = 𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷−8
𝑃* 6𝑀5 + 7𝐷+8. 
 
Thus the observed BF equals the true BF, when loss-of-signal is non-differential by outcome.  No 
correction is needed: one can substitute 𝑀5 for M and directly compute 𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀+). 
 
For loss-of-signal that is differential by outcome, consider 
 
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷8
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8 = 𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8 ⋅𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷)
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8
= 𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷). 
 
Thus calculating 𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷) requires 𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷8, which is observable, but also 𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8, 
which is not observable because true ever-positivity M+ is not observable in the control-arm.  
However, by testing stored samples in the screen-arm, we can calculate 𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8 (“retest-
positive fractions”) and substitute for 𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8.  Consider the ratio 
 
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷−8/𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷−, 𝑀+8
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷+8/𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷+, 𝑀+8 = 𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷−)
𝑃* (𝑀+ |𝐷+) ×  𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷−, 𝑀+8/𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷−, 𝑀+8  
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷+, 𝑀+8/𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷+, 𝑀+8 . 
 
 
35 
The first factor is the true BF that we want to calculate.  Under non-differential loss-of-signal, the 
second factor equals 1, and thus using retest-positive fractions estimates the BF without bias.  Under 
differential loss-of-signal, the second factor still equals 1, but under an assumption.  To see this, note 
that the numerator and denominator of the second factor is 
 
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8
𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8 = 𝑃*6𝐷7𝑀+, 𝑀5 +8 ⋅𝑃*(𝑀5 + |𝑀+)/𝑃*(𝐷|𝑀+)
𝑃)6𝐷7𝑀+, 𝑀5 +8 ⋅𝑃)(𝑀5 + |𝑀+)/𝑃)(𝐷|𝑀+). 
 
Note that 𝑃)6𝐷7𝑀+, 𝑀5 +8 = 𝑃)(𝐷|𝑀+) (i.e. screen-arm outcomes depend only on true ever-
positivity).  If also 𝑃*6𝐷7𝑀+, 𝑀5 +8 = 𝑃*(𝐷|𝑀+) (i.e. control-arm outcomes also depend only on true 
ever-positivity), then all factors on the right-side involving D cancel and thus 
 
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8
𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8 = 𝑃*(𝑀5 + |𝑀+)
𝑃)(𝑀5 + |𝑀+), 
 
which is independent of D, and thus the second factor equals 1.  Thus 
 
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷−8/𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷−, 𝑀+8
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷+8/𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷+, 𝑀+8 = 𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷−)
𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷+) 
 
estimates the BF without bias, despite substituting screen-arm retest-positivity. 
 
Under differential loss-of-signal, the assumption noted above that is required for lack of bias from 
substituting screen-arm ever-positivity is 
 
𝑃*6𝐷7𝑀+, 𝑀5 +8 = 𝑃*(𝐷|𝑀+). 
 
This says that control-arm outcomes depend on true ever-positivity only.  Although reasonable, it 
could fail in an extreme circumstance.  For example, knowing that a person is a true ever-positive, but 
signal is lost and is observed never-positive, that might mean the person has less chance of being D+ 
than if you knew that the signal was retained and the person was observed ever-positive. 
 
 
Accounting for loss-of-signal to calculate RDneg 
 
For RDneg, using Bayes rule, the control-arm outcome rate among never-positives is 
 
𝑃*(𝐷+ |𝑀−) = 91 + 𝑃*(𝐷−)
𝑃*(𝐷+) × 𝑃*(𝑀−|𝐷−)
𝑃* (𝑀−|𝐷+)<
+)
. 
 
The numerator and denominator of the BF are calculated via 
 
𝑃*6𝑀5 −7𝐷8 = 𝑃*6𝑀5 −7𝐷, 𝑀+8𝑃*(𝑀+ |𝐷) + 𝑃*6𝑀5 −7𝐷, 𝑀−8𝑃*(𝑀−|𝐷), 
 
 
36 
and because 𝑃*6𝑀5 −7𝐷, 𝑀−8 = 1 (i.e. no gain-of-signal is possible), then  
 
𝑃*(𝑀−|𝐷) = 𝑃*6𝑀5 −7𝐷8 −𝑃*6𝑀5 −7𝐷, 𝑀+8
𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷, 𝑀+8
. 
 
If loss-of-signal were non-differential by outcome (i.e. 𝑃*6𝑀57𝐷, 𝑀8 = 𝑃*6𝑀57𝑀8), then 
 
𝐵𝐹= 𝑃*(𝑀−|𝐷−)
𝑃* (𝑀−|𝐷+) = 𝑃*6𝑀5 −7𝐷−8 −𝑃*6𝑀5 −7𝑀+8
𝑃*6𝑀5 −7𝐷−8 −𝑃*6𝑀5 −7𝑀+8. 
 
Thus the observed BF does not equal the true BF.  Thus when loss-of-signal is non-differential by 
outcome, RDneg is biased and a correction is needed.  Following the above derivation for correcting 
RDpos for differential (or non-differential) loss-of-signal by substituting retest-positive fractions, the BF 
is unbiasedly estimated by (under the same assumption as for RDpos) by 
 
1 −𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷−8/𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷−, 𝑀+8
1 −𝑃*6𝑀5 + 7𝐷+8/𝑃)6𝑀5 + 7𝐷+, 𝑀+8 = 𝑃*(𝑀−|𝐷−)
𝑃* (𝑀−|𝐷+). 
 
Thus RDneg can be unbiasedly estimated by substituting retest-positive fractions.

Correcting for non-compliance to specimen collections in the control arm 
 
We focus solely on non-compliance in the control-arm from skipping specimen collections, which is 
the non-compliance issue specific to the IE design.  Those who skipped screens but tested positive at 
any screen they attended, are known to be ever-positive.  The only question is how to handle those 
with unknown ever-positivity: those who skipped screens and tested negative on every screen they 
attended. 
 
When you skip a screen, there is no diagnostic intervention or treatments and hence a skipped 
screen does not affect your outcomes (just like if you had tested negative).  Thus, one option is to 
lump those with unknown ever-positivity into the never-positive table, lumping all participants whom 
screening does not affect. This makes sense in the screen-arm, because non-compliance to screens 
is considered part of the effect of screening.  That is, if a screen were hard to comply with (e.g. 
colonoscopy), then that non-compliance plays an unignorable role in the effect of screening.  In 
contrast, some of the non-compliance in the control-arm could happen solely as a part of being in the 
RCT, which is an artificial effect we want to remove.  For example, if control-arm members know they 
are in the control-arm (i.e. no blinding or imperfect blinding) and know they are not receiving 
screening, they may choose to non-comply with specimen collections at higher rates than the screen-
arm.  Thus arm-differential non-compliance is an artifact that might affect the IE analysis that we want 
to remove. 
 
Thus we examine robustness to lumping those with unknown ever-positivity in the control-arm into the 
never-positive table.  In this framework, non-compliance to specimen collections is mathematically 
equivalent to a particularly acute loss-of-signal.  That is, exactly like this control-arm non-compliance 
framework, loss-of-signal does not affect the screen-arm, and lumps those true control-arm ever-
positives who lost signal into the never-positive table.  Then all the math in the Supplement section 
“Correcting for loss of signal in stored control arm specimens“ carries over, where now M is the true 
ever-positivity had the control-arm non-complied in the same way as the screen-arm and 𝑀5 is the 
ever-positivity observed under control-arm non-compliance.  Hence, just as loss-of-signal that is only 
differential by arm (i.e. non-differential by outcome) does not cause bias in RRpos (but does cause 
bias in RRneg), similarly non-compliance that is only differential by arm does not cause bias in RRpos 
(but does cause bias in RRneg).  Similarly, just as loss-of-signal that is differential by outcome causes 
bias in both RRpos and RRneg, non-compliance that is differential by outcome also causes bias in both 
RRpos and RRneg.   
 
Correcting for control-arm non-compliance requires separating out everyone with unknown ever-
positivity in both arms into a third 2x2 table.  Figure S2 is an example of arm-differential non-
compliance: 20% reduction in ever-positivity in the screen-arm and 30% reduction in ever-positivity in 
the control-arm. To get the tables for non-compliance under Figure 1 (which is under perfect 
compliance), in Figure S2 those tables are calculated by multiplying the control arm cells in the 
ever/never-positive tables by the arm-specific compliance rate.  For example, the ever-positive 
control-arm D+ cell in Figure 1 is 750*(1-0.3)=525.  Those who are left out of the ever/never-positives 
tables are placed in the unknown-positive table. 
 
 
38 
We do not propose to correct for RRpos and RRneg to perfect compliance, as that is unrealistic in 
screening practice.  Screen-arm non-compliance is widely considered a reality of screening to accept.  
Hence we correct by setting the compliance rate in the control-arm to equal that in the screen arm.  In 
this way, we remove arm-differential non-compliance, and equalize non-compliance between arms.  
The correction for RRpos requires multiplying the D+ and D- cells in the control-arm ever-positive 
column by the ratio of compliance rates in the screen-arm to the control-arm, for D+ and D-, 
respectively.  This will force the compliance rate in the control-arm to equal that in the screen arm.   
 
Figure S2 shows an example of arm-differential non-compliance: 20% reduction in ever-positivity in 
the screen-arm and 30% reduction in ever-positivity in the control-arm.  The observed ever-positive 
table shows an imbalance in ever-positivity by arm (2000/50000=4% vs. 1750/50000=3.5%).  The 
correction never modifies the numbers in the screen-arm.  The control-arm unknown-positivity 
numbers are corrected by the ratio of the compliance rate in the screen-arm to that in the control-arm, 
separately for those experiencing the outcome (D+) and not (D-).  For example, for control-arm D+, 
the ratio of compliance rates is (1-180/900)/(1-300/1000) = 0.8/0.7.  For control-arm D-, the ratio of 
compliance rates is (1-9820/49100)/(1-14700/49000) = 0.8/0.7.  The ratio of compliance rates is the 
same for D+ and D- because non-compliance is non-differential by outcome.  The corrected ever-
positive table has 4% ever-positivity for both arms, and because the correction imposes 20% non-
compliance in both arms, the totals in the corrected tables add up to 20% less than the full trial.  Most 
importantly, RRpos and RRneg in the observed and corrected tables are the same and equal to that 
under perfect compliance.  Note that, if we had lumped the unknown-positive table with the observed 
never-positive table and calculated RRneg (as we proposed to examine robustness), the RRneg would 
clearly be biased – but the observed ever-positive table is unaffected and RRpos remains unbiased. 
 
Figure S3 shows an example of non-compliance that is both arm-differential and outcome-differential: 
(40% in D+ screen-arm, 80% in D+ control-arm, 80% in D- screen-arm, and 40% in D- control-arm).  
This non-compliance is both strong and is in opposite directions by arm and outcome.  This is 
hopefully unrealistic in practice and chosen solely to make methodological points.  The observed 
RRpos=4.1 and RRneg =8.9 are wildly incorrect.  The control-arm unknown-positivity numbers are 
corrected by the ratio of the compliance rate in the screen-arm to that in the control-arm, separately 
for those experiencing the outcome (D+) and not (D-).  For example, for control-arm D+, the ratio of 
compliance rates is (1-360/900)/(1-800/1000) = 0.6/0.2 = 3.  For control-arm D-, the ratio of 
compliance rates is (1-39280/49100)/(1-19600/49000) = 0.2/0.6 = 1/3.  The ratio of compliance rates 
are reciprocals for D+ and D- because non-compliance is oppositely non-differential by outcome. The 
corrected ever-positive table has different ever-positivity for each arm (760/50000=1.52% for screen-
arm, 800/50000=1.60% for control-arm) because outcome-differential non-compliance does not 
guarantee that ever-positivity will be balanced across arms (except at the null of RR=1, RRpos =1, and 
RRneg=1).   The RRneg in the corrected table happens to equal that under perfect compliance 
(RRneg=1), but that is not guaranteed.  Most importantly, the RRpos is not (RRpos=0.867 under perfect-
compliance, corrected RRpos =0.912). We chose this extreme non-compliance pattern to show that 
corrected RRpos need not be close to RRpos, although in less extreme examples there is little 
difference.  Thus when non-compliance is outcome-differential, the RRpos accounting for screen-arm 
non-compliance will differ from perfect compliance. 
 
 
39 
Note that in Figures S2,S3, the standard trial analysis table is presumed to already account non-
compliance increasing the number of cancer mortality outcomes (D+) in the screen-arm.  Thus, 
although the standard trial analysis table is the same as that in Figure 1 that assumes perfect 
compliance, in Figures S2,S3, the standard trial analysis table assuming perfect compliance would 
not be that in Figure 1.  That is, in Figures S2,S3, the standard trial analysis is defined as providing 
an RR=0.9 in the presence of the chosen level of non-compliance. 
 
A generic assumption required for our corrections is that non-compliance does not depend on true 
ever/never-positivity given arm and risk-factors and outcome information.  If it did, this would be 
called “non-ignorable non-compliance” or “non-compliance not at random”, and cannot be corrected 
on the basis of information known to trial investigators.  This situation is expected to be unrealistic, as 
participants should not be able to guess their test result beyond knowing arm and their own risk 
factors.  However, if the screening test were available outside the trial (which we assume is not 
possible), and those test results were not known by trial investigators, then non-ignorable non-
compliance is certainly possible.

Figure S1.  Example where trial (overall RR=0.8) with larger RRpos =RR=0.8 has more power than RRpos <RR (RRpos=0.7), for very 
small 2.5% ever-positivity, because RRpos =0.8 has more D+ outcomes than RRpos =0.7 (450 vs 283).  This example is the limiting case, 
fixing RRneg=1, as RRpos → RR.

Figure S3.  Figure 1 with arm-differential and outcome-differential non-compliance (40% in D+ screen-arm, 80% in D+ control-arm, 
80% in D- screen-arm, and 40% in D- control-arm) showing the Unknown-positive table. Figures shows the correction to set non-
compliance in the control-arm as equal to that in the screen-arm, leading to the corrected ever-positive table and corrected never-
positive table.
