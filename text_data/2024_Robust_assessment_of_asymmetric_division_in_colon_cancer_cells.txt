Asymmetric partition of fate determinants during cell division is a hallmark of cell differentiation.
Recent works suggested that such a mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells to increase both their
phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and in turn their fitness. To quantify fluctuations in the
partitioning of cellular elements, imaging-based approaches are used, whose accuracy is limited by
the difficulty of detecting cell divisions. Our work addresses this gap proposing a general method
based on high-throughput flow cytometry measurements coupled with a theoretical frameworks.
We applied our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous human colon cells, showing that
different kinds of colon adenocarcinoma cells display very distinct extents of fluctuations in their
cytoplasm partition, explained by an asymmetric division of their size.
To test the accuracy of
our population-level protocol, we directly measure the inherited fractions of cellular elements from
extensive time-lapses of live-cell laser scanning microscopy, finding excellent agreement across the cell
types. Ultimately, our flow cytometry-based method promise to be accurate and easily applicable
to a wide range of biological systems where the quantification of partition fluctuations would help
accounting for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity.

INTRODUCTION
Asymmetric cell division is referred to as the mecha-
nism by which a mother cell splits into two daughter cells
with distinct cellular fates. As first shown by Edwin Con-
klin [1], this process is usually achieved by asymmetric
inheritance of intrinsic cell fate determinants, like spe-
cific proteins or RNA, and plays a crucial role during the
organisms’ development, favoring cell differentiation and
self-renewal [2, 3].
Increasing evidence is vouching for a more ubiquitous
presence of fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular el-
ements.
Indeed, asymmetric segregation has been ob-
served in non-differentiating cell populations as different
as bacteria [4], yeast [5], and tumoral cells [6, 7].
In
bacterial populations, differential segregation of cellular
components has been linked to antibiotic resistance [8].
Similarly, Katajisto et al. [9], studying the partition of
mitochondria in mammalian epithelial stem-like, found
that asymmetric segregation of older mitochondria en-
ables cells to protect themselves from aging by preventing
the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Asymmetric par-
tition of centrosomes has been observed in human neu-
roblastoma and colorectal cancer stem cells, controlled
by polarity factors and influenced by the segregation of
subcellular vesicles during cell division [10].
To quantify the strength of fluctuations at division,
the common route goes through fluorescence microscopy
measurements of either fixed or live cells, where fluores-

cent dyes are used as a proxy for the cellular element of
interest. The partition statistics are then estimated by
looking at the fraction of fluorescence intensity inherited
by the two daughter cells [11, 12]. This approach is, in
principle, much informative; however, it needs the (of-
ten manual) identification of hundreds of division events
to be reliable: a time-consuming procedure that damp-
ens a wide characterization of the partition statistics of
different cell types.
To cope with these limitations, we propose using high-
throughput flow cytometry measurements to quantify
the fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular compo-
nents.
In particular, flow cytometry has already been
applied to study asymmetric division in specific cellular
systems: Yang et al. [5], sorted budding yeast cells to
analyze the differential segregation of proteins between
daughters cells, while Peruzzi and coworkers first applied
multi-color flow cytometry to show that leukemia cells
divide mitochondria and membrane proteins asymmetri-
cally [13]. Here, we generalized the protocol to adher-
ent cell types and probed its accuracy by comparing the
measured fluctuations to those observed with extensive
time-lapse microscopy experiments on a panel of normal
and cancerous epithelial cells.
Our work shows that (i) there is an exact, analyti-
cal expression linking the inherited cellular components
distribution dynamic to the specifics of the partition pro-
cess. Based on this result, we (ii) proposed an experimen-
tal protocol to tag with fluorescent dyes cellular compo-
nents and measure the dynamics of fluorescent distribu-
tion, whose analysis allows for the accurate estimates the
degree of asymmetry in the partition process. Applying
our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous hu-

man colon cells, we found that (iii) different lines of colon
adenocarcinoma display very distinct extents of fluctua-
tions in the cytoplasm partition, that reflect in (iv) dif-
ferent degrees of asymmetric division of their size.

RESULTS
A.
Modeling cells population dynamic in presence
of partitioning noise
We look for a theoretical framework able to describe
the time evolution of a cell population and its dependence
on the partitioning process. In particular, we consider a
population of cells characterized by a certain initial dis-
tribution, P(m)0, of element m.
Monitoring the time
evolution of the abundance of specific cellular elements
over multiple divisions in single-cell experiments, it is ob-
served [14] that a component’s counts presents dynamics
qualitatively similar to the one reported in Figure 1(b).
Indeed, variations in the components number are deter-
mined by: (i) the production and degradation processes
along the duration of the cell growth phase; and (ii) non
identical apportioning of the components between the
two daughter cells. Here, we will assume that the com-
ponents number varies only due to the partition events
and look for a quantitative description of the evolution of
the element distribution. Such an assumption allows us
to neglect the time between divisions and reduces the dy-
namics to a progressive dilution of the components num-
bers in subsequent generations. Note that it is possible
to model the complete growth and division process (see
for instance refs.
[15–17]), but it is more difficult to
separate the different sources of noise.
Each cell i of the population divides into two daughter
cells that we can label unambiguously as 2i and 2i + 1,
which inherit respectively m2i and m2i+1 components.
The process, exactly at division, must conserve the total
number of elements, i.e. mi = m2i + m2i+1 and we call
partitioning fraction the quantity f =
m2i
mi . To model
noise in partitioning, we assume that at each division a
random value for f is extracted from a probability dis-
tribution function, Π(f). Given these assumptions, we
can write the probability distribution of the components
number of a daughter cell m after g divisions from the
mother M as:
Pg(m) =

1
2g−1
 2g−1
X
k=0
Z
dMP(m|M)Pk(M)
(1)
where Pk(M) is the components distribution at gener-
ation k and it is given by the sum of the distributions
of all siblings cells of the k-th generation. After g gen-
erations, the cell lineage generated from cell i forms a
lineage tree composed of ng = 2g cells. Without losing
generality, the division probability can be expressed, as:
P(m|M) =
Z
δ(m −fM)Π(f)df .
(2)
Therefore, we can write the probability distribution,
P(m), of the daughter cells inheriting a fraction, f, of
the mother elements:
P(m) =
Z
dfdMδ(m −fM)Π(f)P(M)
(3)
As is often the case, it is convenient to characterize the
distributions in terms of their moments [16]. We identify
the cell m2i (m2i+1) as the one inheriting a fraction f
(1 −f). In particular, the mean of the daughter cell 2i
components distribution can be expressed as:
µ2i = E[m2i] =
Z
P(m2i)m2i dm2i
=
Z
df dmi dm2i m2iδ(m2i −fmi)Π(f)P(mi)
= E[f]E[mi] = µfµi
(4)
Where E[·] stands for the average. Note that every com-
putation can be symmetrically done for the cell 2i + 1.
Thus, we have that in a single partition, the mean num-
ber of inherited elements of the daughter cells depends
on the asymmetry of the Π(f) and on the mean of the
P(mi).
In Figure 1(d), we show the evolution of the components
number distribution at different generations. The Π(f)
chosen for the simulation is a Cauchy distribution with
location x0 = 1
2 and scale γ = 0.7.
The total distribution is the sum of 2g sub-populations
which derives from the division process. For example, if
we assume Π(f) = 1
2(δ(f) + δ(1 −f)), after one division
we would have a population distributed around fµi and
one at (1−f)µi. After two division the populations would
grow to four sub-populations centered in f 2µi, f(1−f)µi,
(1 −f)fµi and (1 −f)2µi and so on.
To compute the mean relative to an entire generation,
we need to sum over all the different sub-populations:
µg = 1
2g
2g
X
k=1
µk
g
(5)
where µk
g is the mean of k-th sub-population at gener-
ation g and 2g is the total number of sub-populations
for that generation. This equation [A5] can be simplified
into the form (see Appendix for the full computation):
µg =
1
2
g
µ0
(6)
where µ0 is the mean of the initial population. It is rel-
evant to notice, that independently of the characteristic
of Π(f), the mean always halves itself at each genera-
tion. This result is simply understood considering that
for each cell that inherits a fraction f ′ of the compound,
its sisters inherit a fraction 1 −f ′. Hence, at every divi-
sion, the compound counts is diluted by an average factor

mother cell. The cell undergoes an initial phase of duplication, where its internal elements are multiplied, followed by a division

from the model. Dots are colored according to the distributions shown in panel e).
of 2 in the population, and partition distributions with
different properties lead to the same behavior of µg (see
Figure 1(f)). Therefore, no relevant insights on the Π(f)
can be obtained from the first moment. We thus moved
to consider the second moment, i.e. the variance. Sim-
ilarly to what is done for the mean, the variance of the
inherited fraction of elements can be expressed as:
σ2
2i = E[m2
2i] −E[m2i]2
=

i = E[f 2]σ2
i + µ2

(7)
and in turn, the variance of a generation, starting from
the consideration of the variance of a mixture of distri-
butions can be written as (see Supplementary materials
for details):

It is possible to obtain a recursive equation for Ag (see
Appendices), Ag = Ag−1E[f 2] = A0E[f 2]g which leads
to a compact form for equation [A8]:
σ2
g = µ2
0(E[f 2]g −(1/2)2g) + σ2
0E[f 2]g
(10)
4
where E[f 2] = σ2
f + µ2
f = σ2
f + 1/4. Finally, equation 10,
links the variance of the components distribution for the
entire cells population at generation g, to the properties
of the Π(f). It is interesting to highlight that there’s no
dependence on the symmetric properties of the process.
Up to this order, the only relevant feature that shapes
the dynamic is the extent of the fluctuations. Indeed,
as shown in Figure 1(e), the same Π(f), but with a dif-
ferent variance shows a different behavior for σ2
g. Our
analytical results show that the dynamical behavior of
the population variance depends non-trivially on the sec-
ond moment of the underlining partitioning distribution.
The next section will be devoted to demonstrating, how
this condition can be exploited in experiments to measure
the partition noise component.
B.
Measuring fluctuations via flow cytometry
As shown by Peruzzi et al. [13] for leukemia cells grow-
ing in suspension, it is possible to use flow cytometry to
follow the evolution of properly marked cellular elements
in time. Here, we generalized the protocol considering a
panel of colon cell lines, i.e. Caco2, a human epithelial
colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line; HCT116, a human
colorectal carcinoma cell line; and CCD-18Co, a normal
human colon fibroblast cell line. To measure the degree
of asymmetric division, we marked cells’ cytoplasm via
a fluorescent dye and followed its dilution through suc-
cessive generations. As explained in detail in the Ma-
terials and Methods section, the experimental procedure
we used is based on the following main steps: staining of
the selected compound, sorting of the initial population,
plating, and acquisition of the distinct populations in the
following days. The sorting allows us to have an initial
population with a narrow peak at a specific fluorescence
intensity.
To achieve this, we used fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) to isolate a specific cell population based
on cell morphology and fluorescence intensity. The sorted
population is divided into distinct wells, one per ac-
quisition, in equal numbers and kept under identical
growth conditions to mitigate inoculum-dependent vari-
ability among samples [18]. Figure 2(a) shows an exam-
ple of the time course dynamics obtained with HCT116
cells (see Methods for details). Each distribution repre-
sents a different acquisition of a whole well at increas-
ing times from plating (0 to 84 hours from the bottom
to the top). It is possible to neatly observe the succes-
sion of peaks associated with different generations that
succeed one another and the average decrease of the flu-
orescence intensity. Note that different generations can
coexist at the same time point. One can spot the flow of
cells towards higher generations and the behavior of the
peak heights, which grow over time, reach dominance and
then decay. The shift on the y-axis allows to follow the
evolutionary dynamics while being able to see the over-
lapping of the same generation at different time points.
As in each measurement, the distribution of fluorescent
intensity is a mixture of distributions corresponding to
different generations:
p(f) =
X
g
πgP(fg)
(11)
To obtain the necessary information on the properties
of each generations we performed a fitting of the data
via a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with
an Expectation Maximization algorithm (details are ex-
plained in ”Materials and Methods”).
Indeed, assum-
ing that each generation is log-normally distributed with
mean µg and variance σ2
g of the corresponding Gaussian
distribution, equation 11 can be rewritten as :
p(log2(f)) =
X
g
πgN(log2(fg)|µg, σg).
An example of the outcome of the GMM algorithm is
shown in Figure 2(b) for two acquisitions (48h and 60
h from plating). Blue-shaded distributions represent ex-
perimental data, while the best solution of the Gaussian
mixture is shown with a solid line. Each generation’s fit
is identified with a different color. Upon an overnight, we
can identify generations 0, 1, and 2 in both the acquisi-
tions. One can see that their relative fractions changed:
generation 3 became dominant overnight and generation
4 appeared.
Figure 2(c) shows the behaviors of µg and σg as func-
tions of the generation number g for three independent
replicas of the time course experiments with CaCo2 cells.
Dashed lines represent the best fit of the data against
Equation 10, which yields the variance σf of the parti-
tion distribution probability, Π(f). The outcomes of the
fitting procedure on the time course dynamic for all the
replicas of three studied cell lines are reported in Figure
2(d). In particular, Caco2 and CCD18Co cells show a
higher degree of asymmetry with respect to HCT116 as
measured by the division asymmetry of the correspond-
ing partition distribution.
C.
Validation of the method via live fluorescence
microscopy
The flow cytometry-based protocol combined with the
theoretical model provides insights into the properties
of the cell partition function (see Figure 2). To validate
our approach, we performed extensive live time-lapse mi-
croscopy experiments to measure the partition fraction of
a labelled compound during proliferation, providing a di-
rect measure of the Π(f). Specifically, we aimed to follow
a growing cell colony over time, detect divisions, evaluate
the fluorescence intensity of mother and daughter cells,
and calculate the inherited fraction.
The detailed ex-
perimental procedure is described in the Materials and
Methods. Briefly, cells are stained for the cytoplasm and
are plated at low density (approximately 103 cells/well)

on IBIDI cell imaging chambers (µ-Slide 4 and 8 wells).
After 24 hours (sufficient time for complete cell adhesion
to the slide) the wells are washed, the media is renewed
and live imaging acquisition time-lapse is started. Multi-
ple fields are followed in each well, and for each field, we
acquire a z-stack bright-field and fluorescence image (a
single plane is shown in Figure 3a) at constant intervals
(20 min) for 3 days.
The fields are manually selected
at the beginning of the acquisition based on cell den-
sity and fluorescence intensity. The recorded time lapses
have been then manually analyzed to identify divisions.
A sample outcome of the analysis procedure is shown
in Figure 3(b). The total fluorescence of the cells is dis-
played as a function of time, before and after the division.
The mother cell fluorescence decays exponentially over
time and at division it halves due to components parti-
tioning between the two daughters. In this specific case,
we can observe that the fraction of cytoplasm inherited
by the two cells is not equal, indicating an asymmetrical
division. To compute the partition fraction f, we fit the
fluorescence intensity of the daughters’ cells vs time with:
log(I2i(t)) = mt + q2i
(12)
log(I21+1(t)) = mt + q21+1
(13)
where I(t) is the fluorescence intensity at time t, m ac-
counts for the decaying process and 2i and 2i + 1 respec-
tively refer to the two daughter cells. We constrain the
slope to be the same between the two cells. The fraction
6
of inherited fluorescence, f , is obtained as :
f2i =
eq2i
eq2i + eq2i+1
and
f2i+1 = 1 −f2i
(14)
To ensure the highest possible accuracy, we (i) measured
the total fluorescence of the mother cell and those of the
two daughter cells for at least 2 hours before and after the
division event to increase the determination of the fluo-
rescence splitting for each detected mitosis. Moreover,
(ii) we removed all dynamics that showed an absolute
Pearson correlation value between luminosity and pixel
size higher than 0.9 as a function of time (see Supplemen-
tary Information). In fact, single cell’s pixel size, which
corresponds to the cell size projection on the focal plane,
is found to shrink before mitosis and enlarges after di-
vision. Fluorescent intensity is instead proportional to
the number of stained cytoplasmic proteins, which are
expected to remain constant (except for a constant de-
cay of the fluorescence).
Therefore, a high correlation
between pixel size and fluorescence intensity indicates a
high noise-to-signal ratio. Figure 3(c)(bottom) displays
the strip plot of the obtained partition fraction, f, for
Caco2, HCT116, and CCD18Co cells, randomly spread
on the y-axis, and their corresponding fitted Π(f) distri-
butions (top). Note that via microscopy imaging, it is
possible to measure the whole partition distribution and
not just its moments; however, hundreds of events are
required to get a reliable estimate. Here, we characterize
it by fitting the data with a double Gaussian distribution
of the form:
N(1/2, σ) = N(f, σ′) + N(1 −f, σ′)
2
that allows for the measure of both < f > and σ2
f =
σ′2 + f 2 −f −1/4.
The fitted distributions clearly show how HCT116 cells
are the most symmetric with only one central and narrow
peak, while for CCD18Co and CaCO2 cells two asymmet-
ric peaks are visible, associated to higher fluctuations. In
Figure 3(d), we compare the outcomes of the flow cytom-
etry vs microscopy measurements. For all three cell lines,
the found degrees of asymmetry are statistically consis-
tent between the two approaches.
D.
Size division bias accounts for cytoplasmic
fluctuations
To investigate the observed fluctuations in the par-
tition of the cell cytoplasm, we start by recalling that
the used dyes bind a-specifically to cytoplasmic amines.
Thus, (i) it is expected to be uniformly distributed in the
cellular cytoplasmic space and (ii) the number of labeled
cytoplasmic components can be considered large. In this
framework, the least complex model one can assume is a
binomial one with the parameter p, measuring the bias
in the process. Via equation 10 we got a direct link be-
tween the measurable variance of the population and the
second moment of the underlining partition probability
distribution, Π(f). Henceforth we sought for a relation-
ship between the second moment of Π(f) and the param-
eters of the binomial distribution.
To begin with, we can write the partition distribution for
the fraction of inherited component, assuming a level of
asymmetry p (q = 1 −p), as:
Π(f) = 1
2(Π(f)(p) + Π(f)(q)).
(15)
As we have already observed in the general model, due
to symmetry, < f >= 1/2 for any form of the Π(f). No
information on the system can be obtained by looking at
the first moment.
For the second moment, we note that the variance σ2
f
p of
a single branch of the Π(f) is:
σ2(p) = < f 2 >
(p) −< f >2(p)
=
Z
dNiσ2
f|Ni
(p)P(Ni)
(16)
where P(Ni) is the probability distribution of the
mother’s components number at the moment of division,
while σ2
f|Ni
(p), is the variance of the Π(f)p given the num-
ber of internal component Ni in the mother cell.
Recalling that m2i is the number of inherited intra-
cellular components of one of the two daughter cells, the
partitioning fraction f can be expressed as f = m2i/Ni
which leads to:
σ2
f|Ni
(p) = < f 2 >
(p) −< f >2(p)
=

N 2
i
σ2
m
(p) =

(17)
Therefore, by substituting it into equation B2 we obtain:
σ2(p) = pq
Z
dNi

Ni
P(Ni),
(18)
Which explicitly depends on P(Ni) and coherently re-
turns σ2(p) = pq
N for P(Ni) = δ(Ni −N).
An equivalent computation can be done for the symmet-
ric branch (σ2(p)). The variance of the full distribution
is given by:
σ2

of cells with a fixed number of elements before divi-

In Figure 4(c), we compared the analytical expres-

showing that also for the binomial approximation the two
methods are compatible. CaCO2 cells confirm to be as
the most asymmetric among the cell lines and since they
are known for their heterogeneity in cell morphology [19],
we explored the hypothesis of shape heterogeneity and
cytoplasmic asymmetry to be linked.

Different time frames are overlaid to depict the entire
dynamic at once, with time progressing from the bottom

We computed the pixel size ratio between the daughters
cells in the last studied frame and compared it with the
fraction of inherited cytoplasm from the mother cell. Al-
though pixel size is a rough proxy for cell volume, we
observe that the cell inheriting a larger fraction also dis-
plays a greater size. This finding leads us to conclude
that asymmetry in cytoplasm partition is linked to size
fluctuations, where size dictates the observed bias in the
segregation processes.

DISCUSSIONS
Cell division is orchestrated by hundreds of molecu-
lar interactions, which are intrinsically stochastic pro-
cesses [20]. The presence of such stochasticity results in
the insurgence of variability among the cells phenotypes
sharing the same genome, as it is the case for cancer
cells. In this respect, gene expression noise has been ex-
9
tensively characterized [21] as well as the different strate-
gies that cells evolved to regulate the extent of the noise
in these channels [22, 23].
Beside such noise sources,
proliferating cells are subject to the fluctuations origi-
nated by the partition of cellular elements at division.
Analysis of this partition noise highlighted that under
some circumstances, its contribution exceeds the others
in creating heterogeneity [14, 24].
In fact, asymmetri-
cally dividing cells can produce daughters that differ in
size, cellular components, and, in turn, fate [25]. In this
framework, the origin of such asymmetry may be ascribed
to the basal stochasticity of molecular processes taking
place at different levels during the division and/or to spe-
cific, evolutionary-conserved mechanisms used by cells to
control cell fate and generate diversity [3, 26]. In fact,
asymmetric partitioning of components alters the initial
counts of molecules in the following cell cycle, which can
lead the system to a different phenotypic state [27, 28]
Here, we show that an accurate determination of par-
tition fluctuations can be obtained via standard flow cy-
tometry measurements of properly marked cell popula-
tions. Our approach is easier and faster with respect to
the use of microscopy imaging, which requires the ac-
quisition and analysis of extensive recording of the cells,
ultimately limiting the reachable statistics in contrast to
the high-throughput readouts of flow cytometry. More-
over, most of the microscopy-based approaches use fixed
cells and measure the inherited fraction of fluorescence
from a single snapshot of dividing cells. Notably, com-
paring the degree of asymmetry in the division of the
cytoplasm in the three different analysed cell types, we
found that microscopy-derived fluctuations are system-
atically higher than those measured by flow cytometry.
While this could be linked to the different used proto-
cols, it seems more probable that the difference is due to
a systematic overestimation of the fluctuations measured
by microscopy due to its lower statistics.
From a biological point of view, the segregation statis-
tics among the analysed colon cell types are neatly dis-
tinct. CaCo2 cells exhibits the highest degree of cyto-
plasmic partition fluctuations, while HCT116 division is
the one with lowest asymmetry. It is interesting to note
that normal colon fibroblasts sit in between, suggesting
that the cancer-associated dis-regulation of the normal
cell activities leads to the reactivation of asymmetric cell
division in a cancer-specific manner. Indeed, CaCo2 cells
are known to display a markedly heterogeneous distribu-
tion of phenotypes [19].
To get insights on the possible mechanisms behind the
observed asymmetries, we looked for specific shape of the
partition distribution. Following a maximum entropy ap-
proach [20, 29, 30], we started by considering the distri-
bution that employs the fewest assumptions about the
system, i.e. we consider independent segregation, which
directly maps into binomial partitioning. Indeed, this is
a common assumption in segregation models that traces
back to the pioneering works of Berk [31] and Rigney
[32]. Notably, our results indicated biased segregations,
with colon cancer cells displaying different biases.
To explain the origin of those biases, we looked at rela-
tive sizes between the daughter cells right after division.
The found correlation between daughter sizes and the
fractions of inherited fluorescence vouches size as the ori-
gin of the observed biased segregation.
In conclusion, by combining experimental data with
statistical modelling, we show how it is possible to use
flow cytometry data to extract reliable estimates of the
strength of fluctuations during cell division.
Our ap-
proach has the potential to be applied to different cell
types where a quantification of the level of division asym-
metries daughter cells can experience may provide new
insights into the mechanisms of asymmetric cell division
and its role in cancer heterogeneity and plasticity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A.
Cell Culture
Caco-2, colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, was pur-
chased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA, HBT-37) and
maintained in complete culture media DMEM (D6046)
containing 20% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin plus glu-
tamine, nonessential amino acids (NEAA) and sodium
pyruvate, all 1/100 dilution.
HCT116 VIM RFP, col-
orectal carcinoma cell line, was purchased from ATCC
(Manassas, VA, USA, CCL-247EMT) and maintained in
complete culture media McCoy’s 5A (M9309) containing
10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin plus glutamin.
CCD-18Co, colon fibroblast cell line, were purchased
from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA, CRL-1459) and main-
tained in complete culture media DMEM containing 10%
FBS, penicillin/streptomycin plus glutamin, nonessential
amino acids (NEAA) and sodium pyruvate, all 1/100 di-
lution.
All cells were kept in culture at 37◦C in 5% CO2 and
passaged according to the experimental protocol. For all
experiments cells were harvested, counted, and washed
twice in serum-free solutions and resuspended in room
temperature (RT) PBS w/o salts for further staining.
In detail, to detach cells from culture flasks we used
Trypsin EDTA 0.25%. Culture media was removed and
the flasks were washed once with PBS, then Trypsin
EDTA was added and allowed to work for 1 min in an
incubator at 37◦C.
Once the cells appeared detached
the flasks were mechanically agitated to facilitate cells’
loss of adhesion. Trypsin was then inactivated with one
volumes of complete media and cells were collected, pel-
leted, and washed a second time in PBS. To determine
cell viability, prior to dye staining, the collected cells were
counted with the hemocytometer using Trypan Blue, an
impermeable dye not taken up by viable cells.
10
B.
Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting
To track cell proliferation by dye dilution for estab-
lishing the progeny of a mother cell, cells were stained
with CellTrace VioletTM (CTV). The CTV dye staining
(C34557, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), used to moni-
tor multiple cell generations, was performed according to
the manufacturer’s instruction, diluting the CTV 1/1000
in 0.5-1 ml of PBS for 20 min in a water bath at 37◦C,
mixing every 10 min. Afterward, 5x complete media was
added to the cell suspension for an additional 5 min in-
cubation before the final washing in PBS.
Labeled cells were sorted using a FACSAriaIII (Bec-
ton Dickinson, BD Biosciences, USA) equipped with
Near UV 375nm, 488nm, 561nm, and 633nm lasers and
FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences version 6.1.3). Data
were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, version
10.7.1). Briefly, cells were first gated on single cells, by
doublets exclusion with morphology parameters area ver-
sus width (A versus W), both side and forward scatter.
The unstained sample was used to set the background
fluorescence. The sorting gate was set around the max
peak of fluorescence of the dye distribution. In this way,
the collected cells were enriched for the highest fluores-
cence intensity.
Following isolation, an aliquot of the
sorted cells was analyzed with the same instrument to
determine the post-sorting purity and population width,
resulting in an enrichment > 97 % for each sample.
To monitor multiple cell division, the sorted cell popula-
tion was seeded in 12 wells plates (Corning, Kennebunk,
ME, USA) at cell density bewteen [30−70]·103 cells/well,
according to the experiment, and kept in culture for up
to 84 h. Each well corresponds to a time point of the ac-
quisition and cells in culture were analyzed every 24, 36,
48, 60, 72, 84 h by the LSRFortessa flow cytometer. In
order to set the time zero of the kinetic, prior culturing,
a tiny aliquot of the collected cells was analyzed immedi-
ately after sorting at the flow cytometer. The unstained
sample was used to set the background fluorescence as
described above.
C.
Time-lapse Microscopy
To better investigate the cell proliferation dynamics,
we performed time-lapse experiments, for up to 3 days.
In our previous paper [13] we verified that cell growth
is not affected by different dyes combination. Therefore,
in the present work, we used both CellTrace YellowTM
(C34573 A, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and Cell-
Trace Far RedTM (C34572, Life Technologies, Paisley,
UK), to stain the cytoplasm for microscopy analysis.
Low passage cells at around 60 % confluency were
counted and stained with CellTrace dyes 1/500 and
plated on IBIDI cell imaging chambers (µ-Slide 4 and 8
wells) at low cell density of 103 cells/well. After overnight
incubation, the chamber is transferred to the inverted mi-
croscope adapted with an incubator to keep cells in ap-
propriate growing conditions. Brightfield and fluorescent
confocal image stacks were acquired with a 20x air ob-
jective (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan) and Zen Microscopy
Software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), every 20 min.
Time-lapse images were analyzed using ImageJ and in-
house Python programs.

Appendix A: General model for the partitioning noise
We assume that at time zero each cell has mi marked compounds, with a certain distribution in the whole cell
population of mean µ and variance σ2. Each cell in the population, if sufficiently healthy, will divide in two cells and
we would like to follow the evolution of the marker intensity distribution. The splitting ratio is one of the parameter
we want to characterize.
Therefore, by calling mi the number of compounds of the mother cell, m2i and m2i+1 the compound in the two
daughter cell. The probability of finding a cell with m2i marked compounds at generation g is:
P(m2i|mi) =
Z
δ(m2i −fmi)Π(f)df
P(m2i+1|mi) =
Z
δ(m2i −(1 −f)mi)Π(f)df
(A1)
where Π(f) is the distribution probability of the fraction of compound that goes into a daughter cell.
Since we do not study single cells, but populations, we must deal with distributions. We will omit the computation
for m2i+1 since it is equal to m2i if f is substituted with 1 −f.
P(m2i) =
Z
P(m2i|mi)P(mi)dmi
Which according to equation A1 becomes:
P(m2i) =
Z
dfdmiδ(m2i −fmi)Π(f)P(mi)
(A2)
Hence, the expectation value for m2i is :
µ2i = E[m2i] =
Z
dfdmiP(m2i)m2idm2i =
Z
dfdmidm2im2iδ(m2i −fmi)Π(f)P(mi) = E[f]E[mi] = µfµi
(A3)
while for m2i+1:
µ2i+1 = E[m2i+1] =
Z
dfdmiP(m2i+1)m2i+1dm2i1+ =
=
Z
dfdmidm2i+1m2i+1δ(m2i+1−(1 −f)mi)Π(f)P(mi) = E[1 −f]E[mi] = µ1−fµi
For the variance we can do a similar computation:
σ2i = E[m2
2i] −E[m2i]2 =
Z
dfdmidm2im2
2iδ(m2i −fmi)Π(f)P(mi) −µ2
fµ2
i =
E[f 2]E[m2
i ] −µ2
fµ2
i = E[f 2]σ2
i + µ2
i σ2
f
(A4)
Therefore, both variance and mean of the daughters subpopulations are linked to the variance and mean of the
population of mother cells and to the distribution probability of f.
To be able to compare the model with experimental data we need to compute the mean and variance of the whole
population, which is the sum of coexisting subsequent generations.

Where we are assuming that a mother cell always give rise to only two daughters. We can split equation A5 into
two groups, the one that always inherits a fraction E[f] of the mother’s compounds and the symmetrical one which
inherits a fraction E[1 −f].

Equation A7 shows that the mean value of the number of compounds for each generation is independent of the
underlying process and does not depend on the distribution Π(f). Interesting, although expected, but useless for
comparing expectations to experiment.
To obtain a dependence on the partitioning process we need to compute the variance. We want the variance of a
distribution which is given by the mixture of the distribution of all the sub-populations of daughter cells. It can be
demonstrated that the total variance is:

Appendix B: Modeling partition as a binomial process
The model we have developed and tested by comparing two sets of independent experiments allows for a robust
characterisation of the partitioning noise. The measures are done via flowcytometry which allows to obtain a great
statistics. The key point of what we have proved up to now, is that the variance of the partitioning distribution is the
main actor in shaping the population dynamic. In this section we want to propose an interesting case of study, were
we make an assumption on the shape of the partitioning distribution. The reasonable assumption is to consider the
binomial distribution for the partitioning of components. In particular, for the cytoplasm the high number of tagged
components.
Therefore, we want to link the measure of σ of the partitionig distribution done with the general method, to the
value of p of the binomial distribution which would lead to the same observed value.
The binomial model consists in assuming that each cell’s component has a certain probability p of ending up in one
of the two daughter cell, and 1 −p to end up in the other one.
Therefore, the total partition distribution can be written as:
P(f) = 1
2(P(f)(p) + P(f)(q)).
(B1)
As we have already observed, due to symmetry, the < f >= 1/2. But, we are interested in how the general noise,
map into the binomial one.
The variance of a single branch σ2
f
(p), can be computed in the following way:
σ2(p) = < f 2 >
(p) −< f >2(p)
=

dNif 2P(f|Ni)P(Ni) −< f >2(p)

Consider initially one of the two daughter cell distributions for example, P(f)(p). Its average value will be given
by:
< f >(p)=
Z
df
Z
dNifP(f|Ni)P(Ni) =
Z
dNipP(Ni) = p,
and similarly < f >(q)= q. For the variance instead, σ2
f
(p):
σ2(p) = < f 2 >
(p) −< f >2(p)
=
Z
df
Z
dNif 2P(f|Ni)P(Ni) −< f >2(p)

(B2)
where the notation σ2
f|Ni
(p) indicates the variance of the distribution p as a function of f given a certain Ni. Recalling
that f, the fraction of intracellular components and/or fluorescence, is defined as f = x2i
Ni , it follows that:
σ2
f|Ni
(p) = < f 2 >
(p) −< f >2(p) =

(B3)
Plugging Eq. B3 in B2 we get:
σ2(p) = pq
Z
1
Ni
P(Ni),
(B4)
which, consistently, in the case of a delta distribution (i.e., for a single value of Ni), results in σ2(p) = pq
Ni .
Once the main quantities of the individual distribution have been determined, we consider the sum distribution (eq.
B1).
The mean value of this distribution is:
< f >=
Z
fP(f)df = 1
2(< f >(p) + < f >(q)) = 1
2(p + q) = 1
2.
(B5)
Therefore, to determine p, it is necessary to estimate the variance σ2
f. By definition, it is:
σ2
f =< f 2 > −< f >2 .
(B6)
Substituting Eq. B5 one gets:
σ2
f = 1
2(< f 2 >(p) −< f 2 >(q)) −1
4,
(B7)
from which, adding and subtracting < f >2(p), < f >2(q), one gets:
σ2
f = 1
2(< f 2 >
(p) −< f 2 >
(p) + < f >2(p) + < f 2 >
(q) −< f >2(q) + < f >2(q)) =

a.
Delta Distribution of mother’s components
In principle, P(Ni) can have any functional form, even a very complex one, which is not known. Therefore, let’s start
with the simplest case: all mother cells possess the same number of components N0, so the distribution P(Ni) is a
Dirac delta.
In this case, the theoretical variance (eq. B12) will be:
σ2
f = pq
Z
dNi
1
Ni
δ(Ni −N0) + p2 + q2
2
−1
4
(B11)
= pq
N0
+ p2 + q2

−1
4.
(B12)
Since the values of the initial distribution have been considered randomly, each of them will have the same probability
of being selected: P(Ni) =
1
Nmax−Nmin . Consequently, the integral term in the variance expression (eq. B12) can be
simplified as:
Z
dNi
1
Ni
P(Ni) =
1
Nmax −Nmin
Z
dNi
1
Ni
= ln(Nmax) −ln(Nmin)
Nmax −Nmin
,
(B13)
and one gets to the final expression:
Σ(N) = σ2
f = pq ln(Nmax) −ln(Nmin)
Nmax −Nmin
+ p2 + q2

(B14)
Neglecting the integral term, the equation reduces to :
σ2
f = p2 + q2

(B15)
b.
Lognormal distribution of mothers’ components
In an even more realistic case, the distribution of the number of internal components of the mother cells will be given
by a log-normal distribution:
P(Ni) = e
−(ln(Ni)−µ)2)
2σ2
Ni
q
2πσ2
NiNi
,
(B16)
where µ is the average value: µ =< log(N) >.
The integral term in this case is given by:
Σ(N) =
Z
dNi

Ni
P(Ni) =
1

2πσ2
Ni
Z
dNi

N 2
i
e
−(ln(Ni)−µ)2)
2σ2
Ni
.
(B17)
In general, the distribution of internal components of a cell is not known. However, in microscopy experiments, it is
possible to determine fluorescence distributions. Additionally, a direct proportionality between the two variables has
been assumed: I = Ni · F, where F is a constant value representing the fluorescence of an internal component.
Now, consider the variance of the distribution as a function of the number of internal components:
σ2
Ni = σ2
I/F =< ln(I/F)2 > −< ln(I/F) >2
=< (ln(I) −ln(F))2 > −< ln(I) −ln(F) >2
=< (ln2(I) > −< ln(I) >2= σ2
I
(B18)
The variance of the distribution as a function of Ni, therefore, coincides with that of the fluorescence, which can be
determined from experimental measurements.
17
Consequently, for a log-normal distribution, the contribution of the integral term to the variance, integrated over the
interval [1, ∞), will be:
Σ(N) =
Z ∞

)),
(B19)
where the variance coincides with that of the fluorescence distribution (eq. B18) and µ = ⟨log(N)⟩.
Substituting the integral term (eq. B19) into the complete expression for the variance (B10) for a log-normal distri-
bution of the mother cells, we obtain:
