Introduction 
Game theory can provide insights into the outcome of interactions between individuals or groups 
of individuals, if the rules for how they make decisions as a result of their interactions, given 
their own background information, are understood. Typically, it is assumed that individuals will 
act in a way that will maximize their “payoff”, however that may be defined in a specific 
situation. In evolutionary game theory, the payoff to be maximized is “fitness”, i.e., the ability to 
propagate and maximize the number of offspring. If a characteristic that determines the size of 
the “payoff” is heritable, then it is assumed that it will be passed along to be used by the 
offspring in the next iteration.  
It is typically assumed that interacting individuals are playing the same game, i.e., will make 
payoff decisions based on the same underlying set of assumptions. Classic examples of such 
games are Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD), Harmony (H),  Hawk-Dove (HD), also known as a game of 
chicken, or Stag Hunt (SH) also known as coordination game. Depending on the specifics of the 
game, the individuals will make different decisions on whether to cooperate or defect in order to 
maximize their payoff, with pure strategies (only cooperation of defection) dominating in PD or 
H games, mixed strategies dominating in HD, and any of pure strategies in SH game.  
The question of what will emerge as the dominant strategy in a situation, where some individuals 
are playing one game, and others are playing another, has been partially explored in, i.e., 
(Kareva, Karev, 2019) in the context of natural selection between game theoretical models of 
cancer. Here we will address the question of which game, rather than which strategy, will 
dominate over time as a result of natural selection within a community, where different 
individuals can play different games at the same time. 
A mathematical “toolbox”, that allows us to study this process was suggested in (Kareva, Karev, 
2019)  and developed further by (Karev, 2024) where the approach was applied to some 
2 
 
examples from the literature, including local replicator dynamics (C. Hilbe, 2011), pairwise 
competition (J. Morgan, K. Steglitz, 2003) and the game of alleles in diploid genomes (Bohl 
et.al, 2014).  
Here I apply this approach to evolutionary games on graphs. In these games, individuals occupy 
the vertices of a graph and can obtain a payoff from interaction with all adjacent neighbors. In 
addition to the traditional case of a “complete graph”, where all vertices are connected to each 
other, Ohtsuki and Nowak (2006) considered three different update rules for the evolutionary 
dynamics on graphs (see s.3 below). In this paper I explore the question of which game - 
between the classic and the Ohtsuki-Nowak updated versions – is “better”, i.e. will come to 
dominate over time.  
 
1. Replicator equations and parametrized games 
Assume the individuals in a population can choose among n strategies, and define 𝑙𝑖(𝑡)  as the 
number of individuals (i-players) playing i-th strategy at time t. An i-player interacting with a j-
player obtains payoff 𝑎𝑖𝑗 ; 𝐴= (𝑎𝑖𝑗), 𝑖, 𝑗= 1. . . 𝑛 is then defined as the payoff matrix for all 
pairwise interactions between the players. Let us denote 𝑁(𝑡) = ∑
𝑙𝑖
𝑛
𝑖=1   the total population size 
and 𝑥𝑖= 𝑙𝑖/𝑁  the frequency of i-players.  If the population is infinite and well-mixed, then the 
frequencies of i-players solve the replicator equation 
𝑑𝑥𝑖
𝑑𝑡= 𝑥𝑖[(𝐴𝑥)𝑖 −𝑥𝐴𝑥].                                                        (1.1) 
Here (𝐴𝑥)𝑖= ∑
𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑗
𝑛
𝑗=1
 is the expected fitness of strategy i (or the payoff obtained by the i-th 
strategist after interaction with the total population) and  𝑥𝐴𝑥= ∑
𝑥𝑖𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑗
𝑛
𝑖,𝑗=1
 is the average 
payoff over the entire population (see Taylor and Jonker 1978; Hofbauer and Sigmund 1998 for 
details).  
In what follows, we consider two different 2-player games, which we refer to as 𝑔0 and 𝑔1, with 
corresponding payoff matrices 𝐺0 and 𝐺1.  Let us define the “𝛽-population” composed of 
individuals who can play the 𝑔1-game with a certain hereditary probability  and the 𝑔0-game 
with the hereditary probability(1
)


. Individuals in the 𝛽-population play the “mixed” game 
with the parametrized payoff matrix  
𝐺𝛽= (1 −𝛽)𝐺0 + 𝛽𝐺1.                                                         (1.2)

Let us consider a community composed of all 𝛽-populations, where 0 ≤𝛽≤1. Our objective is 
to determine which game, 𝑔1, 𝑔0, or a mixture thereof, will dominate over time as a result of 
natural selection within this community. Evolution of the distribution of the parameter 𝛽 can 
provide us the answer to this question.  
 
2. Mathematical Toolbox 
In what follows, we consider 2-player games with 2 possible strategies, 𝑠0 and  𝑠1.  
Assume  
 𝐺0 = [𝑎
𝑏
𝑐
𝑑],  𝐺1 = [𝑒
𝑓
𝑔
ℎ]. 
Then the payoff matrix for the mixed game is 
𝐺𝛽= [𝐺00
(𝛽)
𝐺01
(𝛽)
𝐺10
(𝛽)
𝐺11
(𝛽)] = (1 −𝛽)𝐺0 + 𝛽𝐺1 = [𝑎(1 −𝛽) + 𝛽𝑒
𝑏(1 −𝛽) + 𝛽𝑓
𝑐(1 −𝛽) + 𝛽𝑔
𝑑(1 −𝛽) + 𝛽ℎ].    (2.1) 
The question of interest is the evolution of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 over time. 
Let us assume, for simplicity, that players in all populations adopt the 𝑠1 strategy with 
probability 𝑝1 and adopt the 𝑠0 strategy with probability 𝑝0 at the initial time 𝑡= 0.  
Let us now formally introduce the auxiliary keystone variable 𝑞(𝑡) using the following equation: 
𝑑𝑞(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
= 𝑥(𝑡), 𝑞(0) = 0. 
Explicit form of this equation is given by equation (2.3) below.  
Now let us denote  
𝑊0(𝑡, 𝛽 ) = (−𝐺00
(𝛽) + 𝐺01
(𝛽)) 𝑞(𝑡) + 𝐺00
(𝛽)𝑡, 
𝑊1(𝑡, 𝛽) = (−𝐺10
(𝛽) + 𝐺11
(𝛽))𝑞(𝑡) + 𝐺10
(𝛽)𝑡 , 
𝑉0(𝑡) = ∫
exp(𝑊0(𝑡, 𝛽))𝑃(0, 𝛽)𝑑𝛽,
Β
                                                                                              
𝑉1(𝑡) = ∫
exp(𝑊1(𝑡, 𝛽) )
Β
𝑃(0; 𝛽)𝑑𝛽. 
Here 𝑃(0; 𝛽) is the distribution of parameter 𝛽 at the initial time.  
Then the pdf of the parameter 𝛽 at t time is  
𝑃(𝑡, 𝛽) = 𝑃(0, 𝛽)(
𝑝0exp(𝑊0(𝑡,𝛽))+𝑝1exp(𝑊1(𝑡,𝛽))
𝑝0𝑉0(𝑡)+𝑝1𝑉1(𝑡)
                                                 (2.2)      
4 
 
and the variable 𝑞(𝑡) solves the explicit equation 
𝑑𝑞
𝑑𝑡=
𝑝1𝑉1(𝑡)
𝑝0𝑉0(𝑡)+𝑝1𝑉1(𝑡).

See (Karev, 2024) for proof and some applications. 
 
3. Games on graphs. Natural selection between initial and updated games 
A possible application of the developed approach is to evolutionary games on graphs. In these 
games, individuals occupy the vertices of a graph and receive payoffs from interaction with all 
adjacent neighbors. The traditional replicator equation (1.1) describes the case of a “complete 
graph”, where all vertices are connected to each other.  
Ohtsuki and Nowak (2006) considered three different update rules for the evolutionary dynamics 
on graphs of degree k, which they call ‘birth-death’ (BD), ‘death-birth’ (DB) and ‘imitation’ 
(IM).  
(i) 
For BD updating, an individual is selected for reproduction from the entire population 
proportional to fitness; the offspring of this individual replaces a randomly chosen 
neighbor.  
(ii) 
For DB updating, a random individual from the entire population is chosen to die; the 
neighbors compete for the b empty site proportional to fitness. 
(iii) 
For IM updating, a random individual from the entire population is chosen to revise 
its strategy; it will either keep its current strategy or imitate one of the neighbors’ 
strategies proportional to fitness.  
In what follows we refer to the games that use the corresponding rules as BD, DB, and IM 
games, respectively. We will then evaluate the interactions between the games with update rules, 
and the original game. 
 
Let 𝐴= (𝑎𝑖𝑗), 𝑖, 𝑗= 1. . . 𝑛  be the payoff matrix of some underlying game, and let k be the 
degree of the graph. Then the three updated mechanisms BD, DB, and IM correspond to 
matrices   
𝐵𝐷= (
𝑎𝑖𝑖+𝑎𝑖𝑗−𝑎𝑗𝑖−𝑎𝑗𝑗
𝑘−2
) ,                                                                                                      (3.1) 
𝐷𝐵= (
(𝑘+1)𝑎𝑖𝑖+𝑎𝑖𝑗−𝑎𝑗𝑖−(𝑘+1)𝑎𝑗𝑗
(𝑘+1)(𝑘−2)
),                                                                                       (3.2) 
5 
 
𝐼𝑁= (
(𝑘+3)𝑎𝑖𝑖+3𝑎𝑖𝑗−3𝑎𝑗𝑖−(𝑘+3)𝑎𝑗𝑗
(𝑘+3)(𝑘−2)
).                                                                                    (3.3) 
Let 𝑥𝑖(𝑡) be the expected frequency of strategy i on an infinitely large graph of degree k at time 
t. Ohtsuki and Nowak (2006) proved that 𝑥𝑖(𝑡) solves the ‘replicator equations on graphs’, which 
coincide with the standard replicator equation with a modified payoff matrices 𝐴+ 𝐵𝐷 , 𝐴+ 𝐷𝐵 
or 𝐴+ 𝐼𝑀 corresponding to ‘birth-death’ (BD), ‘death-birth’ (DB) and ‘imitation’ (IM) games 
on graphs respectively. 
To answer the question of what game between original game (no updates) and game with 
updates, will dominate, let us consider a model of a community composed of 𝛽- populations with 
different payoff matrices  𝐺𝛽 of the form (2.1) and study the natural selection between the 
populations. This process can be formally described by the evolution of the distribution of 
parameter 𝛽 and the outcome of the evolution determines the “dominant” game. The toolbox for 
studying this problem was summarized above. 
Here we consider the games with only 2 strategies and the payoff matrix 𝐴= (𝑎𝑖𝑗), 𝑖, 𝑗= 1,2. In 
this case, 
𝐵𝐷=
1
𝑘−2 [ 0
𝐵
−𝐵
0],      where        𝐵= 𝑎11 + 𝑎12 −𝑎21 −𝑎22;                                        (3.4) 
𝐷𝐵=
1
(𝑘+1)(𝑘−2) [ 0
𝐷
−𝐷
0],  where 𝐷= (𝑘+ 1)𝑎11 + 𝑎12 −𝑎21 −(𝑘+ 1)𝑎22;               (3.5) 
𝐼𝑁=
1
(𝑘+3)(𝑘−2) [ 0
𝐼
−𝐼
0],  where     𝐼= (𝑘+ 3)𝑎11 + 3𝑎12 −3𝑎21 −(𝑘+ 3)𝑎22.            (3.6) 
Below we consider the natural selection between initial and updated games on graphs with k=3.  
 
Example 3.1. 
Let the initial game be the Prisoner’s Dilemma with the payoff matrix: 
𝐴= [5
0
8
1]   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3.7) 
(see Outsuki, Nowak, Eq. (38)). Then corresponding update matrices (3.5)-(3.7) are 
𝐵𝐷= [0
−4
4
0 ] ,                          
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3.8) 
 
𝐷𝐵= [ 0
2
−2
0] ,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3.9) 
6 
 
 
𝐼𝑁= [0
0
0
0].   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3.10) 
 
Let us consider selection between the original game A and the BD game. Corresponding payoff 
matrix for the mixed game is 
𝐺𝛽= (1 −𝛽)𝐴 + 𝛽(𝐴+ 𝐵𝐷) = 𝐴+ 𝛽𝐵𝐷= [
5
−4𝛽
8 + 4𝛽
1 ].                                       (3.11) 
The selection process is described by the dynamics of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 for 
parametric game (3.11), see Fig.4..  
 
 
Fig. 4. Dynamics of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 for parametric game (3.11).  
 
The distribution tends to concentrate at point 𝛽= 1 indicating that the BD game dominates over 
the original game. 
Next, let us consider selection between the original game (3.7) and the DB game (3.9). The 
corresponding payoff matrix for the mixed game is 
𝐺𝛽= (1 −𝛽)𝐴 + 𝛽(𝐴+ 𝐷𝐵) = 𝐴+ 𝛽𝐷𝐵= [
5
2𝛽
8 −2𝛽
1 ].  
 
 
         (3.12) 
Dynamics of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 is shown on the Fig.5.  
7 
 
 
Fig.5. Selection between the original game A (3.7) and DB game (3.9): dynamics of the 
distribution of parameter 𝛽 for parametric game (3.12).  
 
We can see that the distribution of the parameter 𝛽 is non-degenerated at all time; this means that 
individuals who play mixed games A and DB (corresponding to the parameter values 0 < 𝛽< 1) 
persist in the community indefinitely. 
Example 3.2. 
Now assume the payoff matrix for the original game is given by the following (see Outsuki, 
Nowak, Eq. (40)): 
𝐴= [15
0
16
8] .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (3.13) 
This game is also Prisoner’s Dilemma. The corresponding matrices for the updated games (3.4)- 
(3.6) are  
𝐵𝐷= [0
−9
9
0 ] ,                          
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3.14) 
 
𝐷𝐵= [ 0
12
−12
0 ] ,   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3.15) 
 
𝐼𝑁= [0

0 ].                              
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3.16) 
8 
 
The selection dynamics between original game (3.13) and corresponding BD game (3.14) are 
defined by the parametrized payoff matrix  
𝐺𝛽= (1 −𝛽)𝐴 + 𝛽(𝐴+ 𝐵𝐷) = 𝐴+ 𝛽𝐵𝐷= [
15
−9𝛽
16 + 9𝛽
8 ]      
 
 
(3.17) 
The dynamics of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 for parametrized game (3.17) is shown in the 
Fig.6. Over time, the distribution tends to concentrate at the point 𝛽= 1, indicated that  natural 
selection favors the BD game over the original game. 
 
 
 
Fig.6. Selection between the original game A (3.13) and the BD game (3.14). 
 
The parametrized game for selection between the original game (3.13) and corresponding DB 
game (3.15) is defined by the payoff matrix  
𝐺𝛽= (1 −𝛽)𝐴+ 𝛽(𝐴+ 𝐷𝐵) = 𝐴+ 𝛽𝐷𝐵= [
15
12𝛽
16 −12𝛽
8 ]  
 
 
(3.18) 
 
 
 
 
Dynamics of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 for parametrized game (3.18) are shown in Figure 7.

Fig. 7. Selection between the original game A  (3.13) and DB game (3.15): dynamics of the 
parameter 𝛽 distribution for parametric game (3.18).  
 
The distribution of parameter 𝛽 remains non-degenerated at all times indicated that individuals 
who play mixed games A and DB (corresponding to parameter values 0 <  𝛽< 1) persist in the 
community indefinitely. 
Finally, the parametrized game for the selection between the original game (3.13) and the 
corresponding  IN game (3.16) is determined by the payoff matrix  
𝐺𝛽= 𝐴+ 𝛽𝐼𝑁= [
15
−6𝛽
16 + 6𝛽
8 ]  .       
                                                        (3.19) 
Dynamics of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 in parametrized game (3.19) are shown in Fig.8. 
10 
 
 
Fig.8. Selection between original game A (3.13) and IN game (3.16): dynamics of the distribution 
of parameter 𝛽 for parametric game (3.19).  
 
One can see that over time, the distribution tends to concentrate at the point 𝛽= 1, indicated that 
natural selection favors the IN game over the original game. 
 
To summarize, in these examples we looked at which evolutionary game on a graph would 
dominate over time. We considered the cases with update rules described by Ohtsuki and Nowak 
(2006), called BD (birth-death), DB (death-birth) and IM (imitation), and evaluated whether a 
game with update rules would dominate over a game without update rules (the original game A) 
as measured by evolution of parameter 𝛽 in the community. 
 
4. Games on graphs. Natural selection between games with different updating rules 
Now let us consider the selection between games with different update rules. The “mix” of 𝐵𝐷 
and 𝐷𝐵 games (let’s call it BDDB) corresponds to the parametrized payoff matrix 
𝐺𝛽= (𝐴+ 𝐵𝐷)(1 −𝛽) + 𝛽 (𝐴+ 𝐷𝐵) = 𝐴+ 𝐵𝐷 (1 −𝛽) + 𝛽 𝐷𝐵,                       (4.1) 
0 ≤𝛽≤1 . 
The mix of 𝐵𝐷 and 𝐼𝑁 games (let’s call it BDIN) corresponds to the parametrized payoff matrix 
𝐺𝛽= 𝐴+ 𝐵𝐷 (1 −𝛽) + 𝛽 𝐼𝑁                        
 
 
 
 
 (4.2) 
The mix of 𝐷𝐵 and 𝐼𝑁 games (let’s call it DBIN) correspond to the parametrized payoff matrix 
11 
 
𝐺𝛽= 𝐴+ 𝐷𝐵 (1 −𝛽) + 𝛽 𝐼𝑁.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4.3) 
In what follows we study the evolution of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 for parametrized games 
(4.1)-(4.3). 
              
Example 4.1. 
Let us consider the natural selection between BD and DB games with payoff matrixes (3.8) and 
(3.9), given an initial game with the payoff matrix  𝐴= [5
0
8
1]. 
In this case  
𝐺𝛽= 𝐴+ (1 −𝛽) 𝐵𝐷+ 𝛽 𝐷𝐵= [
5
−4 + 6𝛽
12 −6𝛽
1
]   .                                 (4.4) 
The following Figure 9 shows the evolution of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 for the 
parametrized BDDB game (4.4).  
               
 
Fig.9. Evolution of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 for the parametrized BDDB game (4.4).  
We can see that, in this example, all individuals who play mixed games (corresponding to the 
parameter values 0 <  𝛽< 1) are eliminated from the community over time. However, 
individuals playing pure games (BD corresponding to the parameter value  𝛽= 0 and DB 
corresponding to 𝛽= 1) persist in the community indefinitely, maintaining some proportion  
𝑅(𝑡) = 𝑃(𝑡, 1)/𝑃(𝑡, 0).  
The plot of 𝑅(𝑡) for the parametrized BDDB  game (4.4) is shown in Fig.10.

Fig.10. Proportion of the individuals playing pure games 𝑅(𝑡) = 𝑃(𝑡, 1)/𝑃(𝑡, 0) for the 
parametrized BDDB  game (4.4). 
 
Now, let us look at the BDIN parametrized mix game, which describes natural selection between 
BD and IN games given by matrixes (3.8) and (3.10). The outcome of its evolution over time is 
determined by the payoff matrix 
𝐺𝛽 = 𝐴+ 𝐵𝐷 (1 −𝛽) + 𝛽 𝐼𝑁 = [
5
−4(1 −𝛽)
12 −4𝛽
1
] .               
              (4.5)                                     
The following Figure 11 shows the evolution of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 for the BDIN 
parametrized game  (4.5).  
 
Fig.11.Evolution of the distribution pf parameter of 𝛽 for BDIN parametrized game (4.5).  
13 
 
We can see that the distribution of parameter 𝛽 is non-degenerated at all times. This means that 
individuals who play a mix of BD and IN games (corresponding to the parameter values 0 <
 𝛽< 1) persist in the community indefinitely. 
Finally, for the mixed DBIN game the parametrized payoff matrix 
𝐺𝛽 = 𝐴+ 𝐷𝐵 (1 −𝛽) + 𝛽 𝐼𝑁= [
5
2(1 −𝛽)
6 + 2𝛽
1
].  
 
                                (4.6) 
 
The following Figure 12 shows the evolution of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 for the DBIN 
parametrized game (4.6).  
 
 
Figure 12. Evolution of the distribution of parameter 𝛽 for the DBIN parametrized game (4.6).  
Similar to the parametrized BDB game (4.4), all individuals who play mixed games 
(corresponding to the parameter values 0 <  𝛽< 1) are eliminated from the community over 
time; however, the individuals playing pure games (DB corresponding to the parameter value 
 𝛽= 0 and IN  corresponding to 𝛽= 1) persist in the community indefinitely. The plot of the 
proportion of individuals playing pure games 𝑅(𝑡) = 𝑃(𝑡, 1)/𝑃(𝑡, 0) for the parametrized DBIN 
game (4.6) is shown in Fig.13.

Conclusion 
In this paper I study the natural selection between two games to determine, which game will 
dominate in the community as a result of natural selection. The formalization of this question in 
the form of a “parametrized game” and the mathematical toolbox to solve it were recently 
developed in (Karev 2024). Here, I applied the developed approach to natural selection between 
games on graphs. Specifically, I compare standard games on a complete graph with games that 
have updated rules suggested by Ohtsuki and Nowak (2006). The results of the natural selection 
between the initial and updated games, or between different updated games were visualized 
through the evolution of the parameter distribution in corresponding parametrized game. The 
developed approach can be used for other problems, such as local replicator dynamics, pairwise 
competition, the game of alleles in diploid genomes (see Karev 2004) and cancer modeling 
(Kareva, Karev 2019).
