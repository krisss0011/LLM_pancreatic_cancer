Control-Oriented Models Inform Synthetic Biology Strategies in
CAR T Cell Immunotherapy
Raffaele Romagnoli
Abstract— Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell ther-
apy is revolutionizing the treatment of blood cancers.
Mathematical models that can predict the effectiveness of
immunotherapies such as CAR T are of increasing interest
due to their ability to reduce the number of experiments
performed and to guide the theoretical development of
new therapeutic strategies. Following this rationale, we
propose the use of control-oriented models to guide the
augmentation of CAR T therapy with synthetic gene
circuitry. Here we present an initial investigation where we
adapt a previously developed CAR T model for control-
oriented purposes. We then explore the impact of realistic
alternative activation methods as control inputs to ensure
effective tumor clearance.
I. INTRODUCTION
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown
remarkable therapeutic potential in the treatment of
hematological cancers such as B cell leukemias [1]
and lymphomas [2], [3]. CAR T cells are genetically
engineered to interact with high specificity to tumor anti-
gens [4]. Binding of the CAR to tumor target antigens
leads to activation and proliferation of CAR T cells and
tumor cell lysis [2]. Yet, CAR T therapies have encoun-
tered an array of different issues such as insufficient
numbers of CAR T cells, immunosuppressive signaling,
[5], and outgrowth of target antigen-negative or low
tumor cells [6], [7]. A promising strategy to overcome
these challenges is through augmentation of CAR T
cells with additional synthetic gene circuitry [8]–[10].
Current synthetic biology control strategies are focused
on achieving more specific activation of CAR T cells in
presence of the tumor, as well as controlling therapeutic
timing, location, and strength. [11].
The concept of control in CAR T immunotherapy
is still removed from the classical control theory, the
incorporation of which may provide important insights
and tools to design more effective therapies, and this
manuscript aims to bridge this theoretical gap. Two
major classes of models have been previously devel-
oped to investigate CAR T cell behaviors: agent-based
models (ABMs) and models using partial differential
equations/ordinary differential equations (PDEs/ODEs).
ABMs are computational methods that simulate the

spatial and temporal behavior of every single agent/cell
that interacts with the environment following specific
rules [12]. This kind of model is based on simulations
to capture a specific behavior of the system which can
be difficult to describe with mathematical tools [13]. In
contrast mathematical models based on PDEs and ODEs
allow analyses that are impossible to make with ABMs
or solve problems such as optimization and control.
ODEs have been used in the framework of CAR T cells
to describe the behavior of single cells [14], however,
ODEs can also be applied to additional mechanistic
levels in the study of CAR T cells. For instance, a
specific CAR-T design at the cellular level will have
effects on the entire system/population of CAR T cells
and will act on a population of tumor cells. A previously
developed model that provides a high-level behavior of
tumor cell and CAR T cell populations for non-solid
tumors is called CARTmath [15]. This model introduces
three ODEs that describe dynamics and the interactions
between the population of active CAR T cells, memory
(non-active) CAR T cells, and tumor cells. This model
mimics a predator-prey-like model where from the the-
oretical viewpoint tumor clearance cannot be achieved,
which conflicts with real-world outcomes. Additionally,
this model correctly demonstrates that the therapeutic
success is highly dependent on input CAR T cell num-
ber. Since this model reduces all the effects of possible
synthetic biology strategies in the design of the CAR
T cells into a set of parameters, it is difficult to make
a direct connection between the effectiveness of the
therapy and potential synthetic gene circuitry designs. In
this paper, we tackle the challenge of achieving tumor
clearance from a control perspective. We demonstrate
the potential effectiveness of an alternative CAR T cell
activation strategy by modeling it as an external control
input. This additional input complements the traditional
activation mechanism driven by the presence of tumor
cells. Our approach builds upon the model introduced
in [15]. We propose a novel model and a backstepping
analysis [16] to describe the effects of this control input
on tumor clearance in terms of asymptotic stability.
Additionally, we describe novel activation strategies for
CAR T cells that are aligned with our model.

II. CAR T CELL DESCRIPTION
CAR T cells contain synthetic receptors created by
fusing multiple proteins together in a specific orien-
tation. Generally, CARs consist of an antigen binding
domain, usually a single chain variable fragment (scFv)
and T cell signaling domains such as CD28, 4-1BB,
and CD3ζ [8]. The therapy is manufactured typically by
removing a patient’s T cells, genetically engineering the
cells, and infusing them back into the patient [17] The
cells act as a living therapeutic capable of specifically
targeting the patient’s immune system to fight cancer.
Binding of CAR T cells to tumor antigens causes T cell
activation through the signaling domains with endoge-
nous downstream mechanisms, functionally rewiring T
cell activation to user-defined antigen recognition [2] .

III. ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (ODE)
MODEL
CAR T cells are genetically modified to recognize
and eliminate tumor cells, and a mathematical model to
predict their therapeutic activity has been developed in
[15]. This model provides ordinary differential equations
based on the scheme of Fig. 2. The active CAR T
cells have a cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. These cells
proliferate, differentiate into non-active CAR T cells,
and die naturally or are impaired by tumor-induced im-
munosuppressive mechanisms. Non-active CAR T cells
also die naturally, and they activate when stimulated by
the tumor-associated antigen turning into active CAR T
cells. Finally, the tumor cells grow based on the available
resources and are killed by effector CAR T cells. In Fig.
2 the solid and dashed arrows represent positive and
negative effects due to interactions between the three
different kinds of cells. For example, the non-active pool
formation represents the situation where active CAR T
cells become non-active, this phenomenon has a positive
effect on non-active CAR T and a negative effect on
active CAR T cells. Finally, the variables x1, x2, and

x3 represent the tumor cells, the active and non-active
CAR T cells respectively. Since these variables represent
the number of cells, they are all positive. Moreover, all
the model parameters that will be defined in the next
subsections are also non-negative.
A.
Tumor cells
The tumor cells dynamics are
˙x1 = rx1(1 −bx1) −γx2x1
(1)
where
• r: maximum growth rate of tumor cells ([day−1]).
• b: inverse of the tumor carrying capacity ([cells−1]).
• γ: Cytotoxic coefficient induced by effector CAR
T cells ([(cell · day)−1]).
The dynamical equation (1) considers the tumor cells
to be bounded in their growth, and the population is
reduced by the active CAR T cells γx2x1.
B. Active CAR T cells
The dynamics of active CAR T cells are given by
˙x2 = (ϕ −ρ)x2 + θx3x1 −αx2x1
(2)
where the parameters are
• ϕ: proliferation rate of the active CAR T cells
([day−1]).
• ρ: reduction rate of the active CAR T cells due to
the natural death and differentiation into non-active
CAR T cells([day−1]).
• θ: conversion coefficient of non-active CAR T into
active CAR T cells due to the interaction with the
tumor cells ([(cell · day)−1]).
• α: Inhibition/expansion coefficient of active CAR
T cells due to the interaction with the tumor cells
([(cell · day)−1]).
Based on equation (2), the number of active CAR T cells
decays to zero in the absence of tumor cells if ϕ < ρ. The
2
term θx3x1 represents the activation rate of non-active
CAR T cells due to the interaction with the tumor, and
the term αx2x1 describes the effects of stimulatory and
inhibitory signals on active CAR T cells modulated by
the tumor.
C. Non-active CAR T cells
The dynamics of non-active CAR T cells are
˙x3 = ϵx2 −θx3x1 −µx3
(3)
where
• ϵ: effective conversion rate of active CAR T into
non-active CAR T cells ([day−1]).
• µ: death rate of non-active CAR T cells (day−1).
If ϕ > ρ −ϵ the active CAR T cells proliferate and
become non-active CAR T cells. In this case, the term
θx3x1, which also appears in (2), has a negative effect
on the non-active CAR T cell population.
D. Model Analysis
The above system can be rewritten as
˙x = f(x)
where x = [x1, x2, x3]T and
f(x) =

.
This model has four equilibrium points [15] that can be
admissible or not based on the value of the model’s pa-
rameters. We compute the Jacobian matrix as a function
of the equilibrium point xe:

which has a positive eigenvalue, hence x0
e is struc-
turally unstable. In fact, the possible perturbation in
parameters does not affect the stability property of x0
e
that remains unstable. The presence of tumor cells makes
this equilibrium point unstable, and if there are no CAR
T cells, it can grow until reaching a maximum bound.
This point corresponds to a second equilibrium point

it is possible to observe that variation in the model’s
parameters can make x1
e asymptotically stable or unsta-
ble. The other two equilibrium points x2
e and x3
e are less
intuitive w.r.t the first two, and they can be calculated by
following several steps that are shown in [15]. Due to the
presence of bifurcations, x2
e and x3
e may not be feasible,
e.g. their components may have negative values, or can
be stable or unstable. Since x0
e is always unstable, the
effectiveness of CAR-T therapy can be achieved if x1
e
is unstable and one of the other admissible equilibrium
points is asymptotically stable. If in this situation x1
e is
also asymptotically stable then there is a condition of bi-
stability, and the initial conditions are crucial to avoid
the system converging to x1
e. The feasible equilibrium
points x2
e and x3
e describe the situation where tumor and
CAR T cells coexist, and a small quantity of tumor cells
is needed to make the active CAR T cells proliferate and
keep the number of tumor cells bounded.
E. Problem Statement
The model developed in [15] can provide useful
information about the dosing strategies to obtain specific
initial conditions of the CAR T cells. In fact, despite
theory predicting the impossibility of tumor clearance,
it can be achieved in practice if the system can start
from specific initial conditions of the tumor and CAR
T cells. The experiments referenced in [15] show that
using specific initial conditions can lead to low values
of tumor cells as predicted by the model, and this result
represents the practical situation where the tumor is
eliminated. However, the therapy is highly sensitive to
these initial conditions and many arbitrary initial con-
ditions for tumor additional tumor growth and disease
relapse. In this paper, we illustrate the beneficial impact
of an alternative strategy for CAR T cell activation
on tumor clearance. We introduce an enhanced model
incorporating an additional control input for CAR T cell
activation, which can be represented as a feedforward
input. Through a backstepping approach analysis, we
demonstrate that this supplementary input ensures reli-
able tumor clearance by achieving asymptotic stability
at the point x1 = 0.
IV. CONTROL ORIENTED MODEL FOR NON-SOLID
TUMORS
Here we take the previous model as a baseline and
propose a new control-oriented model to determine the
conditions where the tumor clearance condition x1 = 0
is asymptotically stable and the number of active and
non-active CAR T cells converge to bounded values ¯x2
and ¯x3 respectively.
A. Proposed Model
To develop a control-oriented model we first identify
the controllable inputs of the system. From the dynamic

equations

˙x1 = rx1(1 −bx1) −γx1x2
˙x2 = (ϕ −ρ)x2 −αx2x1 + θx3x1
˙x3 = −µx3 −θx3x1 + ϵx2
(5)
the system can be seen as the cascade connection
between non-active and active CAR T cells and active
CAR T and tumor cells. In our analysis, we concentrate
on the initial two equations of (5). Here, the non-active
CAR T cells x3 are regarded as an input u influencing
the dynamics of the active CAR T cells. Additionally, we
introduce a distinct mechanism for activating the CAR T
cells, which is represented by a positive supplementary
input, denoted as τ.
( ˙x1 = rx1(1 −bx1) −γx1x2
˙x2 = (ϕ −ρ)x2 −αx2x1 + θx1u + τ

Fig. 3: The modified model incorporates an additional

CAR T cells.
The control input u represents the non-active CAR T
cells to be activated by the presence of the tumor, and
instead τ is a control input generated by an alternative
mechanism of activation of the CAR T cells. The
blue arrows signify positive and negative effects on the
growth of the active CAR T cells, which also has a
negative effect on the population of non-active CAR T
cells.
B. Asymptotic Stability using the Backstepping Ap-
proach
The aim is to illustrate the beneficial impact of
the additional input τ on tumor clearance. Specifically,
focusing on the tumor dynamics outlined in the first
equation of (6), we interpret the effects of the active
CAR T cells x2 as a control input u1. To achieve tumor
clearance, the control input u1 must ensure asymptotic
stability. Thus, we assume that u1 acts as the following
state feedback controller:
u1 = κ(x1) = r
γ (a −bx1)
(7)
which transforms dynamics of the tumor cells into
˙x1 = rx1 −rbx2
1 −arx1 + rbx2
1 = r(1 −a)x1
which is a linear ODE with x1 = 0 asymptotically stable
for any a > 1. Our objective is to utilize backstepping
control analysis to derive conditions under which the
active CAR T cells exhibit behavior consistent with a
specified state feedback controller u1, aimed at driving
the number of tumor cells to zero. To do so, we backstep
this variable by defining
z2 ≜x2 −κ(x1) = x2 −r
γ

a −bx1

.
(8)
The goal is to show that z2 asymptotically converges
to zero, hence x2 converges to κ(x1). After a change of
variables, the first equation of (6) becomes
˙x1 = r(1 −a)x1 −γx1z2.
Instead the l.h.s of the second equation of (6) is
˙x2 = ˙z2 −ˆb˙x1 = ˙z2 −ˆb

r(1 −a)x1 −γx1z2

where ˆb = rb/γ. The r.h.s is

Consequently, by defining two positive scalars as ˆℓ≜

taking into account that a > 1, ϕ −ρ < 0, and for the

For this quadratic form to be positive definite, we require
[16]:

ξˆℓˆm
An appropriate value of ξ can be determined based
on the bound k > 0. Consequently, (10) becomes a
valid Lyapunov function, establishing x1 = z2 = 0 as
an asymptotically stable equilibrium point. The input
u corresponds to the variable x3, representing the non-
active CAR T cells. Consider the CAR T subsystem
˙x2 = (ϕ −ρ)x2 −αx2x1 + θx3x1 + τ
˙x3 = −µx3 −θx3x1 + ϵx2 −τ
(15)
with τ = 0 and x1 = 0 the equilibrium point x2 = x3 = 0
is asymptotically stable [15] hence if τ is bounded then
the behavior of x2 and x3 remains bounded. From (15),
the equilibrium point for x1 = 0 is given by

¯x3 = −τ(ρ −ϕ −ϵ)

,
where ¯x2, ¯x3 are positive real numbers. Examining the
first equation of (6), it becomes apparent that there
exists a value of x1 and a constant value of x2 that
render the equation asymptotically stable. Consequently,
if x1 is decreasing, then (15) exhibits bounded dynamics,
ensuring the existence of a bound k > 0 for (13). In
summary, to establish x1 = 0 as an attractive point while
ensuring the boundedness of x2 and x3 for a given initial
condition of tumor cells x1(0) , 0, it is imperative to
evaluate the initial conditions of the non-active CAR
T cells x3(0). This guides the system’s behavior in a
vicinity of x1 = 0, which serves as a point of attraction
due to the external input τ calculated in (12). Choosing
τ to nullify a term in (11) may prove challenging
in practical implementation. However, the backstepping
analysis relies on a generic a > 1, ensuring asymptotic
stability for the variable x1 for any τ > (ρ−ϕ)·r
γ
.
C. Connection with existing works
The new model introduced in Figure 3 incorporates
an additional activation mechanism τ (12), and the entire
analysis is developed around it. The question arises
whether τ can be implemented using synthetic gene
circuitry. Recent studies by Chang et al. [5] and Allen
et al. [18] align with our research, as they explore
innovative methods to enhance CAR-T cell functionality
beyond traditional antigen recognition.
Chang et al. [5] demonstrate the potential of utilizing
CARs to recognize soluble ligands, a distinct class of
biomarkers, thereby expanding their utility in disease
treatment. Their study illustrates the engineering of CAR
T cells to robustly respond to various soluble ligands,
including the CD19 ectodomain, GFP variants, and
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b). They reveal
that CAR signaling triggered by soluble ligands depends
on ligand-mediated CAR dimerization and can be finely
regulated by adjusting the mechanical coupling between
the CAR’s ligand-binding and signaling domains. These
findings suggest a role for mechanotransduction in CAR
signaling and propose a systematic approach to engi-
neering immune-cell responses to soluble extracellular
ligands.
In contrast, Allen et al. [18] discuss the challenges
facing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in com-
bating solid tumors within immunosuppressive microen-
vironments. To address this, they engineer circuits utiliz-
ing tumor-specific synNotch receptors to locally induce
production of the cytokine IL-2. These circuits signif-
icantly enhance CAR T cell infiltration and clearance
of immune-excluded tumors, without causing systemic
toxicity. The most effective IL-2 induction circuit oper-
ates in an autocrine and T cell receptor (TCR) or CAR-
independent manner, effectively bypassing suppression
5
mechanisms such as IL-2 consumption or inhibition of
TCR signaling. Their work demonstrates the feasibility
of reconstructing synthetic T cell circuits capable of ac-
tivating the necessary outputs for an antitumor response
while evading critical points of tumor suppression.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
For simulations, we consider the parameters reported
in Table 2, HDLM-2 + CAR-T 123 of [15] and the
experiments reported in Section 3.1 a, where at day
42 CAR T cells are injected. In Fig. 5 we report
the behavior of the model [15] with initial conditions
x(0) = [0, 0, 2 × 106]. At day 42, a population of
inactive CAR T cells x3 = 0.6 × 106 is injected. The
results show that despite an immediate activation, the
initial number of non-active CAR T cells is not enough
to clear the tumor which starts growing again after
approximately 80 days. The only equilibrium point with

x1 = 0 is denoted as x0
e, and it is inherently unstable.
This implies that relying solely on the initial conditions
of non-active CAR T cells, represented by x3(0), is not a
robust solution in the presence of uncertainties. Instead,
by taking into account the constant input τ computed in
(12), the original equilibrium point x0
e becomes a new
equilibrium point, xe
n, as defined in (16). As illustrated
in Fig. 6, we observe that the same initial conditions
as those used in the simulation depicted in Fig. 5 can
guide the system into the region of attraction centered
around x1 = 0. The introduction of τ effectively drives
the tumor cell population towards asymptotic clearance,
ensuring tumor elimination. Based on our simulations
and the steady-state values ¯x2 and ¯x3, we can select
a suitable value for the parameter k = 6 (13). This
choice results in ξ = 1.6946e + 03, demonstrating that
(10) is indeed a decreasing function. It is important to
emphasize that the level of tumor clearance achieved by
the new scheme, as illustrated in Fig. 7, is equivalent to

VI. CONCLUSIONS
Control theory holds significant promise in shaping
the development of synthetic biological gene circuits
and systems. In this context, our attention was directed
towards a prominent player in synthetic biology therapy
for cancer CAR T therapy. We harnessed control the-
ory principles to analyze an established mathematical
model, seeking novel avenues to enhance its therapeutic
efficacy. Our findings demonstrated that by effectively
aligning the initial conditions of non-active CAR T cells
with a therapy designed to bolster CAR T cell activation,
we can guarantee tumor clearance. The work suggests
key therapeutic features with practical design potential.
Such features include building in gene circuitry to
mediate external activation and expansion of CAR T
cells separate from tumor antigen-mediated activation,
6
to accomplish feedforward CAR T cell activation, and
to dampen CAR T cell activation. This work demon-
strates the utility of applying control theory concepts to
guide synthetic gene circuit design toward non-intuitive
functions.
