Abstract
Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most frequent cause of disease among biliary
tract neoplasms. Identifying the molecular mechanisms and biomarkers linked
to GBC progression has been a significant challenge in scientific research. Few
recent studies have explored the roles of biomarkers in GBC. Our study aimed
to identify biomarkers in GBC using machine learning (ML) and bioinformatics
techniques. We compared GBC tumor samples with normal samples to identify
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from two microarray datasets (GSE100363,
GSE139682) obtained from the NCBI GEO database. A total of 146 DEGs were
found, with 39 up-regulated and 107 down-regulated genes. Functional enrich-
ment analysis of these DEGs was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) terms
and REACTOME pathways through DAVID. The protein-protein interaction
network was constructed using the STRING database. To identify hub genes, we

applied three ranking algorithms: Degree, MNC, and Closeness Centrality. The
intersection of hub genes from these algorithms yielded 11 hub genes. Simultane-
ously, two feature selection methods (Pearson correlation and recursive feature
elimination) were used to identify significant gene subsets. We then developed
ML models using SVM and RF on the GSE100363 dataset, with validation on
GSE139682, to determine the gene subset that best distinguishes GBC samples.
The hub genes outperformed the other gene subsets. Finally, NTRK2, COL14A1,
SCN4B, ATP1A2, SLC17A7, SLIT3, COL7A1, CLDN4, CLEC3B, ADCYAP1R1,
and MFAP4 were identified as crucial genes, with SLIT3, COL7A1, and CLDN4
being strongly linked to GBC development and prediction.

1 Introduction
The most prevalent form of Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC), Gallbladder Cancer (GBC)
has an unfavourable outcome and a high death rate[1][2][3][4]. With an average survival
of less than six months as well as a total five-year survival rate of under five percent,
this malignancy is an extremely deadly illness. Since this cancer spreads quietly when a
late diagnosis is made, early detection is crucial. With an ordinary cholecystectomy in
suspicious gallbladder stone illness, 0.5–1.5% of patients were found with gallbladder
cancer [5]. The eighth American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) guideline [6]
states that the most effective possible treatment for GBC at its infancy is surgical
resection; for GBC at a later stage, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy,
and targeted therapy are advised. The extremely aggressive and metastatic features
of advanced GBC, such as local development of tumours, hepatic invasion, and lymph
node metastases, result in minimal reaction to treatment and an unfavourable outlook
for victims [7] [8]. While the complicated procedure and the molecular mechanism
of GBC are ambiguous, numerous investigations have stated the essential function of
numerous biological processes in cancer spread and invasion, including immune evasion
[9], epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [10] [11], and cancer stem cells [12]. In
order to enhance the prognosis for GBC patients, it is imperative to investigate the
novel biomarkers linked to invasion and spreading.
An emerging method in studies on cancer for discovering pathways and genes
as potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers is transcriptome analysis of high-
throughput sequencing, such as microarrays and RNA sequencing [13] [14]. Addition-
ally, bioinformatics are currently employed to uncover biomarkers linked to certain
diseases. An advancement in the better prevention and treatment of GBC could be
achieved by these biomarkers [15]. Relevant gene biomarkers for GBC are currently
being identified by bioinformatic analysis of gene expression data; yet, the behaviour
of the findings of bioinformatics is inconsistent. The predictive importance of several
DEGs in GBC has been shown by current research. But the outcomes of such research
have been inconsistent, maybe because various statistical techniques were employed.
Furthermore, there is still a shortage of examination of the predictive significance of
2
the DEGs utilising machine learning technologies in GBC. Moreover, the enrichment
pathways, Gene Ontology (GO) functions, and interaction network of DEGs are still
unclear. A combination of bioinformatic methodologies and machine learning tech-
niques can yield trustworthy outcomes and improve the GBC biomarker training and
verification process[16].
This study is significant since it utilised bioinformatics and machine learning to
analyse crucial genes for GBC and validate their diagnostic usefulness. This study
is started by collecting 2 GBC-associated microarray datasets from gene expres-
sion omnibus database. We employed bioinformatics to identify key DEGs in GBC
from microarray datasets. DEGs are offered for further functional investigation and
protein-protein interaction analysis. We also identified top 15 hub genes using degree,
maximum neighborhood component (MNC), and closeness methods. The intersection
of the 11 hub genes identified by the three methods was thought to hold the ”real” hub
genes. Additionally, significant genes were found using feature selection methods such
as pearson correlation and the recursive feature elimination technique. Afterwards,
the 11 real hub genes and significant genes, identified by feature selection method, are
trained on GSE 100363 dataset to develop machine learning model using support vec-
tor machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) algorithm. Finally, the model was tested
using independent GSE 139682 dataset to validate the biomarkers. In addition, the
11 real hub genes were validated using GEPIA database. Step by step process of this
study is demonstrated in Figure 1.
1.1 Research Gap
Despite significant advancements in understanding gallbladder cancer (GBC), several
gaps persist in previous research. While numerous studies have highlighted the essen-
tial roles of various biological processes in cancer spread and invasion, the detailed
molecular mechanisms of GBC remain elusive. Specifically, prior research has identified
key biological processes such as immune evasion [9], epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) [10] [11], and cancer stem cells as critical in GBC progression, yet the precise
pathways and interactions governing these processes are not fully understood. Cur-
rent approaches have largely relied on traditional bioinformatics and high-throughput
sequencing methods, such as microarrays and RNA sequencing, to identify potential
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. There has been limited application of machine
learning technologies to examine the predictive significance of differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) in GBC. This lack of integration of machine learning methods may hin-
der the ability to achieve more reliable and reproducible outcomes. Moreover, while
gene expression data have been extensively analyzed to identify relevant biomarkers
for GBC, there remains a significant gap in understanding the enrichment pathways,
Gene Ontology (GO) functions, and interaction networks of these DEGs. Previous
studies have not thoroughly investigated these aspects, which are crucial for eluci-
dating the underlying biological mechanisms and for developing effective therapeutic
strategies. Addressing these gaps is essential for advancing the diagnosis, treatment,
and prognosis of GBC, and for providing a more comprehensive understanding of this
aggressive cancer.

Fig. 1: Flow diagram of proposed methodology: Firstly, two microarray
datasets (GSE100363, GSE139682) were downloaded from GEO. Secondly, differen-
tially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from those datasets. Next, the Gene
Ontology analysis and Pathway analysis was performed with the identified DEGs to
screen significant GO terms and pathways. After that, the protein-protein interac-
tion (PPI) network was constructed. Subsequently, three ranking algorithms (Degree,
MNC, Closeness Centrality) was employed to identify top 15 hub genes which, sur-
prisingly, provided overlapped 11 real hub genes. In parallel, two feature selection
methods (pearson correlation and recursive feature elimination) was employed to fur-
ther identify significant gene subsets. Afterwards, the hub genes and significant genes
subset were trained on GSE 100363 dataset to develop machine learning model using
SVM and RF algorithm. Finally, the model was tested using independent GSE 139682
dataset to validate the biomarkers. Additionally, the real hub genes were validated
using GEPIA database.

1.2 Research Question
This study aims to identify and validate key biomarkers for gallbladder cancer (GBC)
using a combination of bioinformatics and machine learning techniques. Specifically,
it seeks to answer the following questions:
• How can bioinformatics and machine learning approaches be used to identify
biomarkers for gallbladder cancer (GBC) and which method produces optimal
biomarkers for gallbladder cancer (GBC)?
• Which differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are significant in distinguishing
between GBC and healthy samples?
• How can machine learning models be validated to accurately classify GBC
samples based on these DEGs?
• What are the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of the identified hub
genes and DEGs in GBC?
These questions arise from the need to enhance the precision of diagnostic and
prognostic biomarkers, which are crucial for the effective treatment and management
of GBC. Additionally, these questions aim to bridge the gap between traditional
clinical methods and modern computational techniques by leveraging the power of
high-throughput gene expression data and advanced algorithms. Specifically, the study
seeks to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that can serve as reliable
biomarkers for GBC, develop predictive models using these biomarkers, and validate
the effectiveness of these models in distinguishing between healthy and cancerous
samples.
2 Methods
2.1 Data Collection
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) of National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [17] is an accessible, high-throughput
genome database that includes microarrays, chips, and gene expression data. The
database, established in 2000, includes high-throughput gene expression data from
research organisations worldwide. The repository provides access to published articles
and associated gene expression detection data [18]. To find gene expression datasets for
Gallbladder Cancer in the GEO database, we employed the search phrase ”Gallbladder
Cancer AND Homo sapiens” refined by ”expression profling by array”. We obtained a
pair of datasets (GSE100363 and GSE139682) produced on the GPL20795 platform,
HiSeq X Ten (Homo sapiens), containing gene expression data for those suffering from
gall bladder tumours and normal people. The GSE100363 series comprises 8 samples:
4 gallbladder tumours and 4 normal samples. The GSE139682 series comprises 20
samples: 10 gallbladder tumors and 10 normal samples. Figure 2 shows the distribution
of tumour and normal sample counts across selected datasets..

Fig. 2: Distribution of number of samples of both tumor and normal among selected
datasets. The GSE139682 series comprises 20 samples: 10 gallbladder tumors and 10
normal samples. The GSE100363 series comprises 8 samples: 4 gallbladder tumours
and 4 normal samples.
2.2 DEG Identification
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) refer to genes whose expression levels change
significantly between different experimental conditions, such as different tissues, devel-
opmental stages, or disease states. Upregulated genes show higher expression levels
in one condition compared to another. Conversely, downregulated genes exhibit lower
expression levels in one condition compared to another. The upregulation of genes can
indicate activation of specific biological processes, response to environmental stimuli,
or involvement in disease pathways. On the other hand, the downregulation of genes
may indicate suppression of certain biological processes, adaptation to environmental
changes, or inhibition of disease pathways.
GEO2R (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r), a data analysis programme
included within the GEO database, allows for visual statistical analysis of gene
expression profiles. It examines multiple GEO series datasets to discover DEGs
under experimental settings [19]. We utilised GEO2R to identify DEGs in both
GBC tumour and normal samples. Utilising the GEO database, we acquired the
gene log2foldchange(log2FC) value. The ratio of the gene expression values for can-
cer and normal is expressed as a fold change of the gene. The upregulated and
downregulated genes were determined by the positive and negative values of the
log2FC values. Adjusted P −value < 0.05 and |log2foldchange(log2FC)| > 1 for
overexpression along with |log2foldchange(log2FC)| < −1 for downexpression are
employed to determine the statistically significant effect of genes. DEGs were visual-
ized using a volcano map. Venn diagrams were created using the Venny online tool
(https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/) [20].

2.3 Gene Ontology and Pathway Enrichment Analysis of DEGs
Gene Ontology (GO) study yields broad biological research results for a particular
gene or gene set by utilising the concepts of molecular functions (MFs), biological
processes (BPs), and cellular components (CCs). The study of GO has become an
essential component of investigations connected to system biology in recent times.
Pathway enrichment analysis is another tool that helps investigate the biological rela-
tionships between gene sets derived from extensive genome-scale investigation [21]. In
this work, the Gene Ontology database [22] was utilised to investigate the GO terms
related with DEGs, and the REACTOME [23] databases were utilised to do pathway
analysis. An online biological information directory called the Database for Annota-
tion, Visualisation, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/)
combines biological data and analysis tools to offer a complete collection of annota-
tion information for functional genes and proteins [24]. It offers a way for users to
extract biological data. The DAVID online database was used to do biological studies
and examine how DEGs work [22].
2.4 Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) network construction
A public database called the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Pro-
teins (STRING; http://string-db.org) is employed to anticipate the PPI networks[25].
Data on over 5000 species, 20 million proteins, and 3 billion interactions can be found
in the STRING database. Such protein interactions encompass both co-expression
correlations and direct physical interactions. To gain more knowledge of the intricate
regulatory networks seen in organisms, known protein-protein connections can be dis-
covered using the STRING database. According to earlier research, examining the
functional relationships between proteins can reveal fresh information on the origin
or progression of disorders[26]. Applying the STRING database, the PPI network of
DEGs was created for this study.
2.5 Hub gene Identification
Hub genes are often utilised to focus on the subset of DEGs that would most effectively
separate the ill samples from the control group. In turn, we visualised the constructed
PPI network using the Cytoscape software [27] (https://cytoscape.org/), and we used
the Cytoscape CytoHubba plugin to identify the hub genes in the PPI network using
a variety of ranking techniques.
Various methods for node ranking, including local and global approaches, are
offered by CytoHubba [28]. The global approach looks at the node’s interaction with
the entire network, whereas the local ranking technique looks at the node’s inter-
action with its immediate peers. The hub genes were identified using three ranking
algorithms: a global ranking method (Closeness Centrality), a pair of local ranking
algorithms (Degree and Maximum Neighbourhood Component (MNC)). The quan-
tity of nodes that surround a node v is its degree. Maximum connected component
(MNC) is the size of the neighbourhood N(v), which is the set of nodes that are next
to v but do not contain v. Last but not least, closeness centrality, which is determined
by averaging the length of the shortest path connecting a node to every other node in
7
the network, shows how close a node is to every other node in the network. In order
to create machine learning models, we finally determined the top 15 genes from each
ranking approach.
2.6 Identification of significant DEGs using feature selection
methods
We used feature selection techniques, such as Pearson Correlation and Recursive Fea-
ture Elimination (RFE), which select the best features in high-dimensional data, to
further find the important DEGs that best distinguish the diseased samples from
the healthy controls. In a nutshell, RFE ranks the features according to their sig-
nificance and returns the top-n features after eliminating the less significant ones,
where n is the number of features that the user entered. In order to utilise it, the
estimator parameter needs to be initialised by indicating the algorithm to be used
and the n features to select parameter by indicating the number of features to be
selected. Following configuration, the model must be fitted to a training dataset
using the fit() method in order to select the features. In our research, we sup-
plied the sample matrix containing all of the features (146 DEGs) into the RFE
model, setting n features to select to 20 and using the SVM method as a estimator.
Furthermore, Pearson correlation demonstrates the linear relationship between two
variables.Strongly correlated features have a more linear dependence and so have a
similar effect on the dependent variable. Two qualities may be eliminated if there is a
substantial correlation between them. In our research, we entered the sample matrix
including all 146 DEGs of features into a Pearson correlation model, compared the
feature correlations, and removed one of the two features with a correlation higher
than 0.9.
2.7 Developing ML models on GSE100363 dataset
For distinction among GBC tumours and healthy samples, we created two machine
learning models i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifi-
cation models. The applications of SVM, a supervised learning method, is in regression
and classification. For classification purposes, the SVM generates hyperplanes that
maximise the separation between classes. On the other hand, an ensemble classifier
called Random Forest [29] [30] consists of many decision trees and produces a class
that is the mode of the output of each tree individually. In every classification tree, a
certain amount of votes are assigned to each class. Out of all the trees, the algorithm
chooses the category with the highest number of votes.
Moreover, we developed a space of searches for parameter optimisation for each
machine learning model in order to determine the optimal set of attributes. As a result,
for hyperparameter optimisation in RF and SVM, we employed a grid search tech-
nique after randomised search. Regarding the randomised search, we generated a grid
of hyperparameters, and we used random hyperparameter combinations to train and
test our models.Subsequently, the optimal parameter combinations are determined
by identifying the best parameters using randomised search. Table 1 summarizes the
8
tested parameters and selected parameters (highlighted in bold). We employed 4-fold-
cross-validation (CV) to assess such models. The StratifedKFold method is used to
divide the data into four segments, assuring that each subgroup has an equal propor-
tion of positive and negative observations. Choosing one of the subsets for testing and
using all the other subsets for training allows the process to be performed four times.
We computed the accuracy score for every fold and utilised that result for calculating
the mean accuracy.

2.8 Evaluation Tools
Our proposed methodology was assessed using ROC curve performance matrices and
accuracy score [31]. The accuracy score is a measure of the correctness of the model’s
predictions. It quantifies the percentage of correct predictions made by the model out
of the total predictions made. The following formula is used to determine the accuracy
score:
Accuracy score = Number of Correct Predictions
Total Number of Predictions
× 100%
(1)
A graphical representation known as the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve is used to assess how well a binary classification model performs across various
thresholds. For different threshold settings, it plots the actual positive rate (sensitivity)
against the false positive rate (specificity). Specifically, lower values on the plot’s x-
axis indicate lower false positives and higher true negatives, whereas higher values on
the figure’s y-axis indicate higher true positives and lower false negatives. The area
under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) is commonly used as a summary metric to evaluate
the overall performance of the classifier, with values ranging from 0 to 1. A higher
AUC-ROC indicates better discrimination capacity of the model.
2.9 Validation of biomarkers gene expression
Using GEPIA2 (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, http://gepia2.cancer-
pku.cn/), a database of information obtained from the UCSC Xena server that contains
9736 tumour samples and 8587 normal samples, the expression levels of biomarkers in
GBC and normal cases were confirmed. P-values less than 0.05 denoted statistically
significant variations [32].

and 22031 DEGs were discovered. Following execution of the revised P value require-
ment and minimal log2FC, 1800, 432 DEGs are found in accordance (Table 2). In the
end, the common differential expression analysis between the tissues from gallblad-
der tumours and normal tissues produced 146 common differentially expressed genes

3.2 Gene Ontology and Pathway Enrichment Analysis of DEGs
Using the DAVID online tool, GO functional and pathway enrichment analyses were
carried out on the 146 common DEGs. To learn more about the function of the
DEGs that were found, functional analysis was used. Significantly enriched GO terms
and pathways of the discovered DEGs are revealed by the functional analysis. Based
on the GO study, it can be inferred that the overexpressed DEGs are primarily
linked to biological processes such as ”Cell adhesion”, ”Epidermis development”, and
”Keratinization”; cellular components such as the ”plasma membrane” and ”integral
membrane”; and molecular functions such as ”structural molecule activity” (Table 3).
Likewise, the investigation reveals that the downexpressed DEGs are primarily linked
to ”cell differentiation”, ”nervous system development”, ”cell adhesion” for biologi-
cal process, ”the plasma membrane”, ”integral component of membrane” for cellular
component, ”calcium ion binding”, and ”heparin binding” for molecular function.
(Table 4). To further explore the pathways that were found to be enriched in DEGs,
we performed a REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis next. The REACTOME
pathway analysis revealed that the pathways involved in overexpression of DEGs
were primarily enriched in ”Signalling by Receptor Tyrosine Kinases” , ”Formation

tion” pathway (Table 3). Furthermore, ”Signal Transduction” , ”Extracellular Matrix
Organisation” , and ”Hemostasis” pathways were the key ones where downexpressed
DEGs were enriched (Table 4).Using an enrichment dot bubble diagram made with
the bioinformatics website and GO-enriched BP/MF/CC and REACTOME, the GO
keywords and pathways for both overexpressed DEGs (Figure 5) and downexpressed
DEGs (Figure 6) were visualised.

3.3 PPI Construction and Screening for Hub Genes
Utilising Cytoscape and the STRING online database, we constructed a DEG PPI
network to investigate the protein networks linked to identified genes (Figure 7). Next,
employing the cytoHubba plugin, the PPI network was loaded into the Cytoscape
software to visualise and identify the hub genes. We subsequently acquired the top-15
hub genes for each of the three topological ranking algorithms: Closeness Centrality,
Maximum Neighbourhood Component (MNC), and Degree (Figure 8). Amazingly, we
discovered that just 11 of the hub genes were identified by all three ranking methods
(Figure 8, Table 5). The 11 ”real” hub genes were found at the intersection of the hub
genes produced by the three methods.

3.4 Identification of significant genes using feature selection
methods
By employing feature selection techniques to identify the gene sets that most effectively
contribute to the prediction job, we also ascertained the features required to construct
the ML models. The 147 DEGs were used in the application of the recursive feature
elimination and pearson correlation feature selection procedures. To choose the most

suitable group of features for both approaches, we experimented with a number of
threshold values. Through defining the correlation scores above 0.9, we succeeded
to get gene groups of 20 using Pearson correlation method. Furthermore, by setting
the n features to select to 20 and utilising the SVM approach as an estimator, we
succeeded to get gene groups of 20 through the use of the recursive feature elimination
method. Table 5 lists the significant genes that have been identified using both feature
selection methods.

3.5 Evaluating the prediction performance of ML models on
independent dataset
We assessed the variations in the prediction abilities of the two machine learning
models, RF and SVM, on independent dataset(GSE139682) upon feeding them dis-
tinct feature sets of 11 ’real’ hub genes and of genes determined by the two feature
selection techniques independently. Hence, we created three separate datasets for each
biomarker identification methods. First dataset contains the 11 real hub genes as fea-
tures; second and third dataset contains genes identified by pearson correlation and
recursive feature elimination method respectively as features. Following that, these
datasets were classified, and the classification abilities of individual feature selection
techniques and classification algorithms were examined. The accuracy score of these
investigations during the evaluation procedure are shown in table 6 and in figure 9.
Figure 10 shows the AUROC curve of the independent testing dataset for SVM, RF
classifiers with the highest performance for the identified different gene subsets. In
all cases, the result shows that the subset of real hub genes outperformed than other
genes subsets. On the other hand, the gene subset identified by Recursive Feature
Elimination method provided worst performance. These findings imply that classifiers
built using hub genes were able to attain good prediction performances.

3.6 Validation of hub gene expression
Hub gene expression was confirmed using the GEPIA database, with a P−value < 0.05
and a Log2FC > 1 criterion. GEPIA box plots showed that all hub gene expressions in
GBC patients were considerably upregulated in the SLIT3, COL7A1, CLDN4 (Figure:
11). There are little statistical diference in other genes.
4 Discussion
Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common cause of disease among biliary tract
neoplasms, comprising 80% - 95% [33]. Based to GLOBOCAN’s ( Global Cancer
Observatory) 2020 cancer data [34], GBC was the 24th most common cause of cancer
worldwide in 2020, with over 115,949 newly reported cases. The amount of patients
with a GBC diagnosis reached at nearly 84,695 that year because of the severe form
of the cancer. The overall global incidence has been rising over recent years, despite
regional variations in incidence rates. This trend is expected to continue as risk factors
grow more common among populations [35]. The goal and challenge for medical and
scientific research has always been to identify the molecular mechanism and biomark-
ers associated with the onset and progression of gallbladder cancer. This research
has significant research value in enhancing the diagnosis, efficacy of treatment, and
prognosis survival of lung cancer patients.
The current work aims to comprehensively identify potential genes and pathways
associated with gallbladder cancer by bioinformatics analysis and machine learning
methods. From the Gene Expression Omnibus database, gene expression data (expres-
sion profles GSE100363 and GSE139682) were acquired. Afterward, a total of 432
and 1800 potential DEGs were obtained from two different datasets. Of these, 146
were identified as common potential DEGs, with 39 of them being up-regulated genes
and 107 being down-regulated genes related to gallbladder cancer. Next, in order to
explore up-regulated and down-regulated genes, we carried out enrichment studies of
GO analysis (three methods: CC, MF, and BP), pathway analysis using REACTOM
database.

According to the GO and REACTOME study, the overexpressed DEGs are mainly
associated with biological processes like ”cell adhesion,” ”epidermis development,” and
”keratinization,” cellular components like ”integral membrane” and ”plasma mem-
brane,”, molecular functions like ”structural molecule activity” and pathways like
”Signalling by Receptor Tyrosine Kinase. Likewise, the investigation reveals that the
downexpressed DEGs are primarily linked to ”cell differentiation”, ”nervous system
development”, ”cell adhesion” for biological process, ”the plasma membrane”, ”inte-
gral component of membrane” for cellular component, ”calcium ion binding”, and
”heparin binding” for molecular function and ”Signal Transduction” for pathways.
In order to evaluate the interactional links, we also built a PPI network. After
that, we obtained the top-15 hub genes for each of the three ranking algorithms:
Closeness Centrality, MNC, and Degree. Surprisingly, we found that just 11 of the hub
genes—which were regarded as ”real” hub genes—were recognised by all three ranking
techniques. Additionally, SLIT3, COL7A1, and CLDN4 hub gene expressions in GBC

patients were significantly elevated, according to GEPIA box plots. Other genes show
minimal statistical differences.
Additionally, in this investigation, we employed feature selection methods including
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Pearson Correlation to identify the signifi-
cant DEGs that most effectively separate unhealthy samples from the healthy controls.
Then, using the SVM and RF algorithms, the genuine hub genes and significant genes
20
that were found using the feature selection method were trained on the GSE 100363
dataset to create a machine learning model. In order to validate the biomarkers, the
model was lastly validated using the independent GSE 139682 dataset. Nonetheless,
the outcomes showed that the subset of real hub genes outperformed the others, sug-
gesting that these candidate genes could be used as potential biomarkers for GBC
diagnosis.
5 Conclusions
In this study, we analyzed gene expression data using bioinformatics and machine
learning approach, which may supplement traditional clinical prognostic factors,
enabling clinicians to provide more effective therapeutic intervention and personal-
ized treatment for gall bladder cancer. Here, We designed a computational method
that exploits multiple hub gene ranking methods and feature selection methods with
machine learning and bioinformatics to identify biomarkers. In this study, We have
identified 11 key genes with diagnostic and prognostic values in GBC. We identified
these genes by using comprehensive bioinformatics and machine learning technology.
