Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
revolutionizing healthcare, especially in clini-
cal applications. Simultaneously, Digital Twin
technology, which models and simulates com-
plex systems, has gained traction in enhancing
patient care. However, despite the advances
in experimental clinical settings, the potential
of AI and digital twins to streamline clinical
operations remains largely untapped. This pa-
per introduces a novel digital twin framework
specifically designed to enhance oncology clin-
ical operations. We propose the integration of
multiple specialized digital twins, such as the
Medical Necessity Twin, Care Navigator Twin,
and Clinical History Twin, to enhance work-
flow efficiency and personalize care for each
patient based on their unique data. Further-
more, by synthesizing multiple data sources
and aligning them with the National Compre-
hensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines,
we create a dynamic Cancer Care Path—a con-
tinuously evolving knowledge base that enables
these digital twins to provide precise, tailored
clinical recommendations.

Introduction
Delivering optimal oncology care presents several
challenges that complicate decision-making for
healthcare providers. Although Electronic Health
Records (EHRs) contain extensive patient data,
there is often no user-friendly tool to easily ac-
cess a patient’s complete treatment and medica-
tion history. This lack of accessibility makes it
difficult for providers to review past treatments
and make informed decisions about future care.
Additionally, aligning a patient’s specific condi-
tion with the National Comprehensive Cancer Net-
work (NCCN) guidelines poses another challenge.
While the guidelines provide evidence-based rec-
ommendations, they must be personalized to each
patient’s unique circumstances, such as their diag-
nosis, treatment history, and underlying conditions.
Furthermore, even after identifying the appropriate
treatment, it must adhere to payer-specific Prior
Authorization (PA) criteria, adding administrative
complexity and potentially delaying care.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) have greatly impacted healthcare
by enabling faster, more precise care across various
applications, including surgery, medical consulta-
tions, administrative workflows, treatment plan-
ning, diagnosis, and more (Väänänen et al., 2021).
A notable advancement in this field is the devel-
opment of digital twin technology, which facili-
tates personalized treatment simulations and predic-
tive modeling, directly impacting patient-specific
outcomes. The concept of a Digital Twin (DT)
is well-established and refers to a dynamic, real-
time digital counterpart of a physical object or
system, with continuous data exchange and in-
teraction—distinguishing it from a static digital
model that lacks real-time data integration between
the digital and physical systems (Kritzinger et al.,
2018). Advances in AI and LLMs have signifi-
cantly accelerated the adoption of digital twins in
healthcare (Erol et al., 2020; Makarov et al., 2024).
In this context, digital twins can model human or-
gans, tissues, and cells, constantly updating with
new data to predict future states. Moreover, preci-
sion medicine harnesses these technologies to tailor
disease treatment and prevention based on individ-
ual genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors,
leading to the creation of virtual human models
that enhance clinicians’ ability to understand, di-
agnose, and treat diseases effectively (Sun et al.,
2023).
While digital twin technology has revolution-
ized clinical applications in various medical spe-
cialties, its potential in enhancing healthcare op-
erations remains largely under-explored. Digital
twins can greatly assist in care coordination by
helping providers create tailored care plans based
on individual conditions. For instance, a coordi-
arXiv:2409.17650v1  [cs.AI]  26 Sep 2024
nator digital twin could streamline communica-
tion between stakeholders, such as laboratories
and healthcare providers, ensuring seamless in-
formation flow throughout the cancer care jour-
ney. Building upon the foundation of digital twins,
agent-based models integrate AI and LLMs to cre-
ate sophisticated multi-agent systems (MAS) that
can simulate complex interactions within health-
care operations. These agent-based digital twins
serve as digital counterparts for various assets in
healthcare operations, enhancing accuracy and effi-
ciency. Digital twins can model not only physiolog-
ical elements like heart functions but also complex
processes, such as clinical decision support and
workflows like prior authorization (Croatti et al.,
2020).
This paper examines the concept of agent-based
digital twins and their role in building LLM-based
multi-agent systems for oncology operations. The
objectives of this paper are as follows:
• Define the digital twin framework, highlight-
ing various capabilities and demonstrating its
use cases in oncology.
• Establish a Cancer Care Path as a knowledge
base to support digital twins in making clinical
recommendations.
• Present a case study illustrating how different
agents collaborate using various knowledge
bases to streamline workflows.

Related Work
AI and LLMs have revolutionized healthcare in re-
cent years. Models like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024)
have matured to a point where they can signifi-
cantly influence clinical decision-making (Wójcik
et al., 2023), enhancing the care provided by hu-
man healthcare professionals and improving patient
outcomes (Javaid et al., 2023). LLM-based frame-
works enable the creation of healthcare agents that
integrate data sources, knowledge bases, and an-
alytical models into their LLM-driven solutions
(Abbasian et al., 2024). Open-source models like
LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) have demonstrated
performance comparable to proprietary models,
particularly in radiology examination questions
(Adams et al., 2024). LLMs show potential in
generating accurate, concise, and comprehensive
responses to patient queries with minimal risk of
harm (Yalamanchili et al., 2024). Recent advance-
ments in prompting techniques, such as Chain of
Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) and In-Context
Learning (ICL) (Dong et al., 2022), enable mod-
els to think step-by-step based on provided exam-
ples, improving both transparency and answer qual-
ity. Prompt optimization techniques (Wen et al.,
2024; Pryzant et al., 2023) have further boosted
performance on specialized tasks. Additionally,
self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) has increased
the reliability of LLM-generated outputs.
LLMs have made a significant impact on health-
care, delivering remarkable results across various
applications. They have been utilized in generat-
ing discharge summaries (Ellershaw et al., 2024;
Williams et al., 2024) and improving care coor-
dination (Nashwan and Hani, 2023; Jung et al.,
2024). Many studies have focused on EHR-based
applications, including information extraction (Gu
et al., 2024; Cui et al., 2024; Ahsan et al., 2023),
question-answering (Yan et al., 2024), and text-to-
SQL parsing (Lee et al., 2022). In oncology, LLMs
have been extensively employed. Domain-specific
LLM development has been explored, particularly
for prostate cancer (Tariq et al., 2024), and they
have been used for decision support in personal-
ized oncology care (Benary et al., 2023). GPT-
4 has demonstrated the ability to answer 85% of
examination-style multiple-choice questions from
the American Society of Oncology (Longwell et al.,
2024). LLMs have been applied to breast cancer
report generation (Naik et al., 2023) and to extract
clinical information from radiology reports, such
as breast ultrasounds (Chen et al., 2024) and lung
lesions from medical images (Li et al., 2024). Addi-
tionally, LLMs have been used to interpret ESMO1
and NCCN guidelines for lung cancer (Iivanainen
et al., 2024), as well as to generate clinical guid-
ance trees for decision-making (Li et al., 2023).
Digital Twins have been applied in oncology for
predicting cancer progression and detecting metas-
tases (Batch et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022), as
well as in cardiology, where they simulate heart
functions to optimize treatments through predictive
modeling (Corral-Acero et al., 2020). In neurology,
digital twins assist in therapy planning and patient
monitoring for conditions such as Alzheimer’s and
epilepsy (Ashraf et al., 2024). AI and Digital Twins
also contribute to fields like stress management
(Kumi et al., 2024), nephrology (Miao et al., 2023),
and autism care (Iannone and Giansanti, 2024), il-
lustrating their impact across medical disciplines.

Methodology
Before delving into the practical applications, it is
essential to introduce two key concepts that form
the foundation of our approach. First is the Cancer
Care Path, which outlines the ideal sequence of
care a patient should follow throughout their on-
cology journey. This serves as the benchmark for
optimal patient care. Second, is the Digital Twin
framework, which defines the structure and func-
tionality of our digital twins. It outlines the capabil-
ities and inputs of each digital twin, as well as their
interactions and collaboration with other agents to
achieve desired outcomes. These principles col-
lectively inform the design and implementation of
digital twins in oncology care.
3.1
Cancer Care Path
Cancer Care Path represents a comprehensive,
structured approach of managing patient’s journey,
right from cancer diagnosis through treatment and
beyond. It is designed to act as a knowledge graph
or decision tree that outlines the ideal flow of care
for a cancer patient. This path incorporates all
the critical stages, starting from the early detection
of symptoms, to the diagnostic tests that can be
prescribed, and further to the available treatment
options and medications. Each step or entity within
this path is represented as an object in itself, hav-
ing its own guidelines that dictate when and how
it should be used. These guidelines ensure that
decision-making is streamlined, reducing variabil-
ity in care while improving patient outcomes by
adhering to best practices. For example, an entity
within the care path may represent a specific diag-
nostic test or treatment modality, and it comes with
associated guidelines that help determine whether
it is appropriate for a given patient. An agent, inter-
acting with this path, can check whether all clinical
criteria for proceeding to the next step are fulfilled.
This system facilitates efficient, evidence-based
care management.
NCCN Guidelines form the foundation of Can-
cer Care Path. These evidence-based, research-
backed, recommendations provide authoritative
guidance on the treatment, management, and pre-
vention of cancer. Developed by the National Com-
prehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), these guide-
lines are widely regarded as gold standard in on-
cology for clinical decision-making. Furthermore,
Cancer Care Path has been developed in consulta-
tion with expert oncologists to ensure that it inte-
grates practical clinical insights alongside NCCN’s
evidence-based recommendations. This compre-
hensive approach ensures that patients receive opti-
mal care at every stage of their cancer journey, in
alignment with the latest advancements in cancer
treatment.
3.2
Digital Twin Framework
In our framework, a digital twin represents a vir-
tual replica of a real-world entity or process within
oncology care. This digital twin processes multiple
input modalities—including text, audio, imaging,
and structured medical data—and generates outputs
based on predefined knowledge sources and embed-
ded intelligence. These knowledge sources may in-
clude the cancer care path, NCCN guidelines, and
payer guidelines for treatment acceptance. The dig-
ital twin’s functionality is driven by dynamically
generated prompts, which are augmented through
techniques like In-Context Learning (ICL) (Dong
et al., 2022) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reason-
ing (Wei et al., 2022). In-Context Learning adapts
to input data by retrieving examples from a vec-
tor database that stores relevant cases, utilizing
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis
et al., 2020) to enhance decision-making processes.
This retrieval ensures that the prompts remain con-
textually relevant to each individual patient case,
thereby improving the twin’s ability to generate
accurate and patient-specific insights.
Multimodal large language models (LLMs), po-
tentially fine-tuned for oncology-specific tasks, pro-
cess the dynamically generated prompts. By gen-
erating explicit reasoning logs, the digital twin’s
outputs are made interpretable to healthcare profes-
sionals, offering insight into the rationale behind
each prediction, recommendation, or simulation.
To handle more complex tasks that go beyond the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the
digital twin ecosystem often integrates software en-
gineering techniques. This integration transforms
digital twins into sophisticated software programs
that incorporate LLMs as core components, but
extend their functionality through symbolic reason-
ing and algorithmic processes. For instance, these
engineering techniques can be used to simulate the
likelihood of a prior authorization request being ap-
proved by a payer, modeling not just probabilistic
outcomes but also deterministic, rule-based logic
such as payer-specific criteria.
In addition to its core functionality, the digital
twin is capable of agent collaboration, wherein it
communicates and delegates tasks to other special-
ized agents via function calling. This distributed
architecture ensures that complex, multi-step work-
flows are handled efficiently. For instance, if a
twin requires verification of whether a treatment
aligns with payer guidelines, it can delegate this
task to another twin specifically designed to handle
payer-related queries. This collaborative approach,
as illustrated in Figure 3, allows the ecosystem to
manage interconnected processes in parallel, ensur-
ing scalability and reducing the cognitive load on
any single digital twin. By leveraging both mul-
timodal data inputs and state-of-the-art machine
learning techniques, the digital twin framework in
oncology care provides an advanced, adaptive, and
explainable system capable of supporting complex
clinical decision-making.

Twin Applications for Oncology
The application of digital twins in oncology helps
enhancing patient care by integrating advanced data
analysis, clinical guidelines, and real-time decision
support. Each twin is designed to handle specific
aspects of the oncology care journey, from deter-
mining the medical necessity of treatments to vi-
sualizing a patient’s clinical history and guiding
the overall care pathway. Together, these digital
twins form a cohesive system that supports health-
care providers in making informed, evidence-based
decisions at every stage of a patient’s treatment as
depicted in Figure 3.
4.1
Medical Necessity Twin
The Medical Necessity Twin assists healthcare
providers in determining the medical necessity of
treatments and diagnostic tests in oncology care.
By evaluating the patient’s clinical data—such as
symptoms, diagnostic tests, and prior treatments in
conjunction with established guidelines such as the
NCCN guidelines and payer-specific criteria, this
twin ensures that proposed treatments are appro-
priate and justified based on the patient’s medical
history and condition.
Figure 2: Illustrating the various agents that comprise
the Medical Necessity Twin, highlighting how they in-
teract and address each item on the clinical guideline
checklist.
As demonstrated in previous research, the Medi-
cal Necessity Twin achieves 86% accuracy in au-
tomating the determination of medical necessity
(Pandey et al., 2024). Additionally, the Medical
Necessity Twin supports other twins by providing
Figure 3: Different twins in Digital Twin ecosystem leveraging knowledge base and interacting with other twins for
optimal efficiency
real-time assessments of treatment eligibility. This
ensures that any recommendations made by other
twins meet the specific criteria required for payer
approval, thereby improving the overall efficiency
of patient care.
4.2
Clinical History Twin
The Clinical History Twin is designed to visual-
ize the complete timeline of a patient’s tests, treat-
ments, and clinical interventions in a chronolog-
ical format. By presenting this data in a clear,
time-sequenced manner, this twin allows health-
care providers to quickly and efficiently interpret
the progression of care. This visualization aids in
identifying patterns, understanding the effective-
ness of previous treatments, and determining the
next steps in care. Furthermore, it allows health-
care professionals to spot gaps or delays in care
and assess how well the treatment plan has been
followed.
To implement the Clinical History Twin, a com-
bination of structured and unstructured data is
extracted from the patient’s EHR. LLM-based
agents are used to extract and convert key clinical
events into structured formats identifying important
events, such as treatment milestones or changes in a
patient’s condition, and organizing them within the
timeline. Additionally, these agents map relation-
ships between various clinical events—such as link-
ing a diagnosis to subsequent treatments—thereby
ensuring the timeline offers a comprehensive, in-
terconnected view of the patient’s care history. Ex-
periments to validate this approach are ongoing,
and the results with a detailed architecture will be
discussed in a future paper.
4.3
Care Navigator Twin
The Care Navigator Twin plays a pivotal role in
guiding a patient’s oncology care journey by lever-
aging the cancer care path. By analyzing patient-
specific data, including their EHR and clinical his-
tory, it predicts the next optimal steps in the care
journey, ensuring that each decision follows the
most current clinical guidelines. This involves iden-
tifying which diagnostic tests, treatments, or med-
ications should be recommended at each stage of
the patient’s journey, based on both historical data
and current best practices.
The Care Navigator Twin can anticipate poten-
tial challenges or deviations from the expected care
path by comparing the ideal cancer care path with
the patient’s actual care journey using input from
the Clinical History Twin. Additionally, its pre-
dictions are further strengthened by real-time data
from the Medical Necessity Twin, ensuring that
treatment decisions are both clinically sound and
meet payer-specific guidelines, increasing the like-
lihood of treatment approval.

Case Study: Ovarian Cancer Diagnosis
We present a case study of ovarian cancer, demon-
strating the use of the previously mentioned twins
at various points in the care process. First, we con-
structed the cancer care graph using a variety of
guidelines and online resources, particularly adher-
ing to NCCN guidelines. We then illustrate how
Figure 4: A visual representation of Cancer Care Graph built for Ovarian Cancer Diagnosis
and where different agents interact throughout the
patient’s oncology care journey.
5.1
Cancer Care Graph
Using the ovarian cancer NCCN guidelines2, we ex-
tracted key diagnostic tests and tools employed in
diagnosing ovarian cancer. Our focus is primarily
on the initial symptoms and the diagnostic process
that progresses to a clinical determination of ovar-
ian cancer a hown in Figure 4. Similar graphs can
be developed for treatment and follow-up monitor-
ing, and can be extended to other cancer types.
5.2
Diagnosis Journey
The journey begins when a patient presents to a
primary care provider with symptoms such as bloat-
ing, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating
or feeling full quickly, or urinary symptoms. If
the provider suspects ovarian cancer after review-
ing the patient’s history and conducting a physical
exam, the Care Navigator Agent suggests a series
of preliminary tests based on NCCN guidelines.
These tests typically include CA-125 or other tu-
mor marker tests, a Complete Blood Count (CBC)
with Liver Function Tests (LFT), and/or a transvagi-
nal ultrasound. At this point, the Medical Neces-
sity Twin identifies the patient’s payer from the
2Refer: https://www.nccn.org/guidelines/category_1
EHR and retrieves the payer’s guidelines for each
recommended test. It then runs simulations to de-
termine which of these tests are likely to be ap-
proved based on the patient’s medical condition
and the clinical examinations already performed
by the provider. A sample CA-125 guideline from
Anthem3 is shown in Figure 5. The Medical Ne-
cessity Twin evaluates the relevant data, checks if
the clinical guidelines are satisfied, and does the
same for all recommended tests. The provider can
then see, in real-time, which tests are eligible for
recommendation based on the results provided by
the Medical Necessity Twin.
Based on the preliminary test results, the Care
Navigator Twin interprets the cancer care graph and
recommends the next steps, which could include
an abdominal/pelvic CT scan. It also recommends
that the CT scan be conducted with oral and IV
contrast, following NCCN guidelines. Once again,
the Medical Necessity Twin becomes active, identi-
fies the correct CPT code for this test—74177 (CT
of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast) versus
74176 (without contrast)—retrieves the relevant
guidelines, and determines if the test will be ap-
proved.
Similarly, for all other tests and treatments, as
3Refer: https://www.anthem.com/dam/medpolicies/abc/
active/guidelines/gl_pw_e002881.html
Tumor Marker Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) Testing
CA-125 testing is considered medically
necessary for any of the following:
1. Evaluation of a pelvic or abdominal mass in
postmenopausal individuals; or
2. Evaluation of a pelvic or abdominal mass
suspicious for an epithelial ovarian cancer
or other specified malignancy in
premenopausal individuals; or
3. Evaluation of an individual with signs or
symptoms suggestive of ovarian cancer (for
example, ascites, abdominal distention,
bloating, pelvic/abdominal pain, difficulty
eating or feeling full quickly, urinary
symptoms);
Figure 5: An example checklist from Anthem listing
medical necessity conditions for CA-125 testing
shown in Figure 3, the Medical Necessity Twin
fetches the appropriate guidelines from both the
payer and NCCN sources. Based on simulations,
it provides results to the provider. During each
encounter with the provider, the Clinical History
Twin continues to accumulate data, offering in-
sights from prior test results to both the provider
and the Care Navigator Twin, thus enhancing the
decision-making process.

Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced a framework for cre-
ating digital twins and demonstrated its use cases
in oncology. Specifically, we presented three key
twins: the Medical Necessity Twin, the Care Nav-
igator Twin, and the Clinical History Twin. We
showcased how these twins will collaborate to en-
hance the efficiency of care delivery. Additionally,
we introduced the concept of the Cancer Care Path,
which supports the twins in knowledge retrieval
tasks. Combined with NCCN guidelines and payer-
specific criteria, this forms a comprehensive knowl-
edge base that the twins can leverage. This led to
the creation of a collaborative ecosystem, where
the twins operate within and are enriched by their
environment. Each agent generates logs through
chain-of-thought prompting, contributing to the ex-
plainability of the entire twin ecosystem. Finally,
we presented a case study to illustrate the structure
of the Cancer Care Path and how these agents work
together to successfully navigate the care process
for optimal outcomes in ovarian cancer.

Future Work
We have introduced an ecosystem that supports
clinical decision-making and operations in oncol-
ogy. While we defined a set of preliminary twins
within this ecosystem, there is potential to expand
the number of twins to support a broader range of
operations. Each twin will adhere to the digital
twin framework, enabling seamless collaboration
and interaction within the ecosystem. The frame-
work itself can also evolve to incorporate additional
features that streamline collaboration and workflow
management. One such enhancement could be the
implementation of self-verification mechanisms,
such as self-consistency or fact-checking, to mini-
mize hallucination and ensure high-quality results.
Future twins could focus on tasks such as am-
bient note-taking, patient education, self-care best
practices, and patient scheduling, each of which
would benefit from the collaborative ecosystem.
The knowledge base, which the twins rely on, must
also become more sophisticated. It should not only
include clinical guidelines but also practical in-
sights, providing comprehensive and exhaustive
knowledge tailored to specific use cases. Further
work is needed to improve how knowledge is orga-
nized and presented to these agents, ensuring that
the system produces accurate and reliable outputs.
While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting en-
hances explainability at the agent level, there is a
need for additional tools to provide transparency
at the twin and ecosystem levels.
This would
help make the entire ecosystem more interpretable
and trusted by the medical community, fostering
broader acceptance of this technology in clinical
settings.
