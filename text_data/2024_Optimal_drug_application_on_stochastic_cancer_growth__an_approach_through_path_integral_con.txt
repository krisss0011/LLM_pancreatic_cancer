Abstract
We provide an overview of an optimal control problem within a stochastic model of tumor growth,
which includes drug application. The model comprises two stochastic differential equations (SDE) repre-
senting the diffusion of nutrient and drug concentrations. To account for various uncertainties, stochastic
terms are incorporated into the deterministic framework, capturing random disturbances. Control vari-
ables, informed by medical principles, are used to regulate drug and nutrient concentrations. In deﬁning
the optimal control problem, a stochastic cost function can be established, and a Feynman-type path inte-
gral control approach would lead to an optimal drug treatment.
Introduction:
Cancer remains among the top causes of mortality globally, sparking extensive research across various sci-
entiﬁc ﬁelds. Mathematicians in cancer research have approached tumor growth through mathematical mod-
eling from multiple perspectives (Zhao, 2010). Frequently, models assume that tumors expand with radial
symmetry, a concept supported by early in vitro observations showing that initial solid tumor growth tends
to be radially symmetric (Esmaili et al., 2024). Evidence also suggests that low glucose and oxygen levels in

the central parts of tumor spheroids may foster sub-populations of quiescent, hypoxic, anoxic, and necrotic
cells (Tao, 2009; Zhao, 2010). Consequently, many tumor models differentiate live cells into proliferative and
quiescent groups. It’s essential to note that all systems encounter uncertainties due to environmental factors,
experimental variability, and more. This has led researchers to explore stochastic tumor growth models to ac-
count for random ﬂuctuations and unknowns. Additionally, given the signiﬁcance of cancer treatment, numer-
ous studies have focused on models addressing the effects of drug therapies on tumors (Esmaili and Eslahchi,
2017; Esmaili et al., 2024).
The rise of personalized medicine in cancer treatment has transformed therapeutic strategies for patients
with tumors that possess actionable mutations. For some, this shift has signiﬁcantly extended lifespans, low-
ered toxicity, and enhanced quality of life. Unfortunately, however, this group remains limited; estimates
from 2020 suggest that only around 5% of patients beneﬁt from targeted therapies (Wang et al., 2024). More-
over, while personalized treatments offer substantial beneﬁts, they rarely lead to a complete cure, as tumors
often evolve resistance through Darwinian mechanisms (Khan et al., 2024; Vikramdeo et al., 2024). In re-
sponse, a new approach called evolutionary therapy aims to leverage disease evolution dynamics to optimize
drug choices and treatment schedules. Researchers are utilizing both mathematical and experimental models
to explore practical questions of theoretical signiﬁcance, such as how resistance to one drug inﬂuences sensi-
tivity to others and whether heterogeneous tumor populations respond differently to treatment based on their
state. Insights from these studies have already informed rational drug sequencing and cycling, beneﬁting
bacterial infections as well as various cancers. In therapeutic scheduling, adaptive therapy—rooted in Evolu-
tionary Game Theory (EGT) has shown encouraging results, not only in theory but also in a phase 2 trial for
men with metastatic prostate cancer (Kaznatcheev et al., 2017). Experimentally, the principles of EGT have
been validated in vivo, with ongoing development of in vitro assays and observations of interactive dynamics
using these methods (Wang et al., 2024).
Cancer cells, like other populations of living organisms, consist of individual cells with unique behav-
iors and evolutionary backgrounds. Their interactions and life histories are ﬁlled with stochastic elements,
including genetic variability, transitions in cell fate, differential drug responses, signaling differences, and
micro-scale environmental ﬂuctuations within the tumor. Many of these represent demographic stochasticity,
where random variation can often be averaged out if the population is large enough. This concept underpins
the understanding of tumor heterogeneity by dividing cells into sub-populations (Pramanik, 2024a). Such
2
grouping is effective when mutation-selection dynamics are balanced so that only closely related genotypes
with the same phenotype persist stably (Wang et al., 2024). These clusters, known as quasispecies, form
distributions around a central genotype, with cells in each group displaying similar behavior despite minor
genetic differences and random birth or death events. However, environmental stochasticity, which remains
signiﬁcant even in large populations as it encompasses random factors that affect entire groups simultane-
ously. In cancer, such ﬂuctuations can result from factors unrelated to treatment, such as small but frequent
changes in the physiology of the host. Moreover, individual cells within subpopulations will still respond
differently to these broad disturbances. Therefore, implementation of environmental stochasticity reﬂects an
approach focused on modeling the averaged response of subpopulations to these overarching system-wide
inﬂuences (Pramanik et al., 2024).
When modeling such ﬂuctuations in continuous time, Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) often
appear, with Stochastic Control Theory providing a means to optimize their behavior (Pramanik, 2021c;
Pramanik and Polansky, 2021, 2023). This approach gives a mathematical perspective for making sequen-
tial decision making such as determining the appropriate drug dose over time while accounting for random
shocks (Pramanik and Polansky, 2020), like unpredictable shifts in the ﬁtness of competing cancer cell sub-
populations. Any static treatment approach will produce a random evolutionary path for the tumor and a
random cumulative cost (which could represent total drug usage, time to recovery, or a blend of these factors)
(Wang et al., 2024). Dynamic Programming (DP) (Pramanik, 2020; Pramanik and Polansky, 2024b) aims to
create equations for the cumulative cost of the best strategy, allowing that strategy to be expressed in feedback
form, meaning treatment decisions (dose and duration) are updated according to the current state of the tumor
rather than following a predetermined schedule. This approach can be implemented to various cancer models
and treatment types, including strategies aimed at either stabilizing or eradicating the tumor. However, rather
than choosing a strategy that minimizes the average expected cost, one can select the objective function that
maximizes the probability of achieving a speciﬁc goal (e.g., meeting therapy objectives without surpassing a
set cost limit). These risk-aware, or threshold-aware, policies are designed to adapt the treatment plan based
on the response of the tumor to previous drugs and the cost accumulated up to that point.
McKean Jr (1966) dynamics is highly advantageous in stochastic control under random perturbations,
particularly for systems where interactions are shaped by both individual behaviors and population-level
inﬂuences (Carmona et al., 2013; Carmona and Delarue, 2015). First, McKean–Vlasov dynamics enables
3
mean-ﬁeld interactions (Lasry and Lions, 2007), meaning that the behavior of a single cancer cell depends
not only on its own state but also on the state distribution of all other cells (Polansky and Pramanik, 2021;
Pramanik, 2024b). Second, in large systems, modeling each cancer cell individually can be computation-
ally intensive. McKean–Vlasov dynamics reduces this complexity by focusing on the average effect of the
population, making large-scale stochastic control problems more computationally feasible (Hua et al., 2019).
Third, mean-ﬁeld terms help smooth ﬂuctuations due to random noise, fostering more stable and reliable
treatment policies a major beneﬁt for systems where high noise sensitivity could otherwise result in erratic
responses (Pramanik, 2022a,b, 2023b,c). Fourth, in multi-host environments where hosts are inﬂuenced by
their surroundings and each other, McKean–Vlasov dynamics captures these interdependent behaviors effec-
tively. It allows for both centralized and decentralized strategies to efﬁciently manage large populations of
interacting hosts (Pramanik and Polansky, 2024c). Fifth, McKean–Vlasov dynamics is beneﬁcial for risk-
sensitive or mean-ﬁeld treatment strategies, as it enables the management of not only individual outcomes
but also their distributions. This ability to ﬁne-tune policies to control both mean and variance is particularly
useful when controlling risk (variance) is essential (Pramanik, 2016, 2021b). Lastly, in systems exhibiting
herding effects, McKean–Vlasov dynamics incorporates self-reinforcing behaviors, where hosts’ actions in-
ﬂuence one another (Pramanik and Polansky, 2024a). This approach is valuable in settings requiring behavior
synchronization or collective dynamics for the desired system outcome.
Formulation of a stochastic control:
Let us assume a ﬁxed ﬁnite time t > 0 where the cancer treatment takes place. For a measurable space (Ω,F ),
let P(Ω,F ) be the probability measure on (Ω,F ) such that Ωis the sample space of the state of cancer, and
F is the Borel sigma algebra B(Ω) (Carmona et al., 2016). Let Cn =C
 [0,t]
Rn
be the continuous functions
[0,t] 7→Rn. Deﬁne an evaluation process ζs on Cn by ζs(x) = x(s) and the truncated supremum norms ||.||s
on Cn by
||x||s := sup
ν∈[0,s]
|xν|,
∀s ∈[0,t],
where x is a value a value of the cancer state X ⊂X . Unless otherwise speciﬁed, Cn is endowed with the
norm ||.||t. Assume B(s) be an n-dimensional Brownian motion under Cn. For θ ∈P(Cn), let the image of
4
θ under ζs is represented by θ(s) ∈P(Rn). For ρ ≥0 and a separable metric space (κ,γ), assume P ρ(κ) is
the set of probability laws θ ∈P(κ) with
R
κ γρ(x,x0)θ(dx) < ∞for some x0 ∈κ. For ρ ≥1 and θ,θ′ ∈P(κ),
consider γκ,γ as the ρ-Wasserstein distance, deﬁned as
γκ,γ(θ,θ′) := inf
(Z
κ×κ ϑ(dx,dy)γρ(x,y)
1/ρ
: ϑ ∈P(κ×κ) has marginals θ,θ′
)
.
(1)
The probability space P ρ(κ) equipped with the measure γκ,γ, and P(κ) has topology of weak convergence
(Carmona et al., 2016; Pramanik and Polansky, 2024b). Both of these probability spaces are deﬁned on Borel
σ-algebras, which coincide with the σ-algebra generated by the mappings
P ρ(κ) ∋θ 7→θ(˜κ),
P(κ) ∋θ 7→θ(˜κ),
where ˜κ is an arbitrary subset of κ. For a ﬁxed adapted therapy {θ(s)}s∈[0,t] with values in P(Rn) of proba-
bility measure from Rn, our objective to solve

where for two exponents ρ′,ρ ≥1, and the adaptive treatment space U taking values from Rn consider the

In Equation (3) µ, σ are the drift and the diffusion components, respectively, u ∈U is an adaptive treatment,
h is the treatment cost function with its terminal value ˜h which takes the values from two sets, failure and

such that if x(t) ∈T , the therapy fails, and if x(t) ∈T ′, the therapy succeeds. Now we are going to provide an
explicit structure of the drift and the diffusion components of the SDE (3). Following Wang et al. (2024) one
can examine three categories of cancer cells. Glycolytic cells (GLY) operate without oxygen and generate
lactic acid, which can harm the neighboring healthy tissue. The other two cell types are aerobic, with access
to improved vasculature, which is encouraged by the production of the VEGF signaling protein. Cells that
actively produce VEGF (VOP) allocate part of their resources toward developing vasculature, whereas the
remaining aerobic cells do not contribute to this process and can be considered free-riders or defectors in
game theory terms. Let {mg(s),md(s),mv(s)}′ be a vector of continuous time-dependent subpopulations of
these three types of cancer with dynamics dmj/ds = πimi, for all i ∈{g,d,v} so that πi is the ﬁtness of ith
type of cancer. These πi’s are expressed from the competition between different populations of cancer cells.
In this model of cellular competition within tumors, the dynamics resemble a public goods or club goods
scenario. Here, VEGF functions as a club goods since its beneﬁts are limited to VOP and DEF cells, whereas
the acid produced by GLY acts as a public goods with its harmful effects on healthy tissue assumed to provide
an advantage to all cancer cells. The foundational model in (Kaznatcheev et al., 2017) presumes that each
cell engages with n neighboring cells, with its beneﬁts determined by its own cell type and the distribution
of other cell types nearby. Given that all cells are sampled uniformly at random from a large, well-mixed
population, it is possible to calculate all ﬁtness values, denoted as πi, as the expected payoffs within this
interaction involving (n+1) cells (Wang et al., 2024). Since, the total cell population is extremely large (i.e.,
n →∞), we can approximate their interactions as resembling a mean-ﬁeld game (Lasry and Lions, 2007;
Carmona et al., 2016). Furthermore, the expected payoffs πi’s depend on current subpopulation fractions

where λ(s) is the Lagrangian multiplier. To deal with Equation (7), a specialized variant of the stochas-
tic Pontryagin principle such as the Feynman-type path integral technique introduced by Pramanik (2020)
and further developed by Pramanik and Polansky (2024b) can be applied to derive an analytical solution for
this system (Pramanik and Polansky, 2024c). When dealing with high-dimensional state variables and non-
linear system dynamics, as encountered in Merton-Garman-Hamiltonian SDEs, numerically constructing a
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation becomes highly complex (Pramanik, 2023a). The Feynman-type
path integral method effectively addresses this issue of dimensionality by providing a localized analytical so-
lution (Pramanik, 2021a; Pramanik and Maity, 2024). To apply this approach, a stochastic Lagrangian (i.e.,
Equation (7)) is ﬁrst formulated for each continuous point within the interval s ∈[0,t], where t > 0. Then,
this time interval is split into k equal subintervals, and a Riemann measure associated with the state variable
is deﬁned for each subinterval. After constructing a Euclidean action function, a Schr¨dinger-type equation is
derived via Wick rotation (Djete et al., 2022). Imposing ﬁrst-order conditions on both state and control vari-
ables allows us to ﬁnd a solution of this system. This approach has promising applications in cancer research
(Dasgupta et al., 2023; Hertweck et al., 2023; Kakkat et al., 2023; Khan et al., 2023; Vikramdeo et al., 2023;
Khan et al., 2024).

Concluding remarks:
It is now well understood that cancers adapt and evolve while one person is under therapy, and this under-
standing is gradually being factored into treatment planning. In some instances, adapting treatment can be as
straightforward as switching from one targeted therapy to another. However, instances where tumors consist
of a diverse mix of interacting cell types, such adjustments are often impractical. Therefore, an ecological
approach called adaptive therapy is gaining interest. Until recently, clinical trials and theoretical models of
adaptive therapy have relied on initial assumptions about the interactions within tumors and how they affect
tumor composition over time (Wang et al., 2024). However, a growing number of studies, conducted both in
lab settings and live models, are beginning to establish methods to measure more accurately these interac-
tions. Since these tools advance, the next hurdle will be to understand these dynamics directly in patients and
leverage them to enhance personalized treatment options.
In this paper we suggest an alternative mean-ﬁeld approach driven by a McKean-Vlasov dynamics. Mean
ﬁeld games, while present in various forms for some time, particularly in economics, have their theoretical
roots in the groundbreaking contributions of Lasry and Lions (2006a,b, 2007), as well as Huang et al. (2006).
The central idea is to model the behavior of a large group of optimizing individuals who interact with each
other through mean-ﬁeld dynamics, under certain energetic or economic constraints. This approach simpliﬁes
the study of consensus by focusing on a control problem for a single representative individual, who interacts
with the environment formed by the collective behavior of others. Essentially, when consensus is achieved,
the system’s inherent symmetries (Pramanik, 2024c) drive individuals to conform to a type of law of large
numbers, resulting in a propagation of chaos effect as the population size increases (Carmona et al., 2016).
Inspired by the theory of propagation of chaos, it can be anticipated that simpliﬁed equations might apply as
the number of cancer cells becomes extremely large, making it feasible to work with solutions that are less
complex than seeking Nash equilibria in large-scale stochastic differential games as previously discussed.
This insight forms the basis for deﬁning the mean ﬁeld game problem. A mean ﬁeld game is fundamentally an
asymptotic framework for the game, where each cell’s inﬂuence on the overall empirical measure is minimal.
This suggests that, in the limit, optimization problems may become decoupled and uniform. In other words,
the equilibrium problem at this limit reduces to a standard optimization problem for a single representative
cancer cell, which interacts or competes solely with the environment shaped by the asymptotic behavior
9
of the marginal empirical measures, {θ(s)}s∈[0,t], linked to an adaptive treatment {u(s)}s∈[0,t] ∈U which
is exchangeable. In the absence of common noise, the classical law of large numbers indicates that the
limiting environment would be a deterministic sequence of probability measures, {θ(s)}s∈[0,t], representing
the equilibrium distribution of the population. However, when common noise is introduced, its effects do
not cancel out, and thus the limiting environment becomes a stochastic sequence, {θ(s)}s∈[0,t], reﬂecting the
conditional distribution of the population in equilibrium given the common noise. This inclusion of common
noise introduces new possibilities in cancer research by providing a dynamic perspective on the system’s
behavior.
