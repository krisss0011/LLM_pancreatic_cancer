Summary 
 
Detection and differentiation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and non-CTCs in blood 
draws of cancer patients pose multiple challenges. While the gold standard relies on 
tedious manual evaluation of an automatically generated selection of images, machine 
learning (ML) techniques offer the potential to automate these processes. However, 
human assessment remains indispensable when the ML system arrives at uncertain or 
wrong decisions due to an insufficient set of labeled training data. This study introduces 
a human-in-the-loop (HiL) strategy for improving ML-based CTC detection. We combine 
self-supervised deep learning and a conventional ML-based classifier and propose 
iterative targeted sampling and labeling of new unlabeled training samples by human 
experts. The sampling strategy is based on the classification performance of local latent 
space clusters. The advantages of the proposed approach compared to naive random 
sampling are demonstrated for liquid biopsy data from patients with metastatic breast 
cancer.

Introduction 
Continuous research on cancer over the last decades has led to a steady improvement 
in early detection and treatment, resulting in an increase in patient outcomes in terms of 
both survival rates and quality-adjusted life years1–5. Thus, monitoring cancer progression 
is important to evaluate individual treatment responses. Especially detection of 
metastasis is of high interest as it is the driving force behind progression and strongly 
correlates with patient outcome. As part of the metastatic cascade, tumor cells 
disseminate from the primary tumor and circulate primarily through the bloodstream to 
surrounding or distant organs6. These cells are referred to as circulating tumor cells 
(CTCs). Numerous studies have analyzed blood draws of patients to investigate the 
spread of tumor cells and to identify related markers in liquid biopsy (LB)7–9. However, 
challenges arise from the heterogeneity of CTCs, such as various phenotypic 
expressions6, CTC rarity (< 10 cells ml−1)10, and reliable CTC detection is still associated 
with difficulties. 
So far, only one solution is cleared for routine clinical analysis of CTCs from 
metastatic breast, prostate and colorectal cancers11 by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)12: the CellSearch® (CS) system (Menarini Silicon Biosystems, 
Bologna, Italy). Multiple clinical studies with the CS system have demonstrated a tight 
correlation between CTC appearance and poor prognosis in metastatic breast cancer13–
15. CS follows a three-step process. First, in the Autoprep system (Menarini), blood 
samples are processed with a widely used method for isolating CTCs from the bulk of 
blood cells through EpCAM (Epithelial cell adhesion molecule)-based immunomagnetic 
separation. Secondly, these enriched cells are fluorescently labeled. Subsequently, the 
cells are placed in a magnetic cartridge where a magnetic force draws them to a single 
focal depth16. The cartridge is then transferred into the Autoanalyzer (Menarini) for 
automated microscopy scanning. In the next step, images containing positive signals in 
the 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) and phycoerythrin (PE) 
channels in close proximity16 are automatically selected and presented in an image 
gallery by a software. Finally, all presented images have to be evaluated manually by a 
trained operator to identify CTCs and differentiate them from contaminating leukocytes or 
artifacts12 according to defined criteria. A cell is considered a CTC when it has a round or 
oval shape with a diameter of at least 4 µm, a DAPI-positive nucleus, cytoplasmic PE 
staining as indicator for keratin positivity, but no APC staining to exclude CD45-positive 
leukocytes.   
Although human assessment of CTC candidate images will remain necessary, 
there is a strong need for greater automation of CTC detection and analysis. Zeune et 
al.17 used LB data from various cancer entities, a.o. metastatic breast cancer, in a 
supervised deep learning (DL) approach. The cell images were sampled from cartridge 
images acquired by CS using the ACCEPT tool18, and automatically generated 
annotations were manually corrected by human experts. They further shed light on the 
model behavior by investigating the latent space using dimension reduction and analyzing 
clustering behavior for different sub-populations of cells. Building on the findings of Zeune 
et al.17, Nanou et al.19 presented a strategy for semi-supervised labeling of training data 
by utilizing a latent space analysis and identifying additional unambiguous samples in 
dense CTC and non-CTC regions identified by a k-nearest neighbor (kNN)-based 
3 
analysis19. In parallel, self-supervised learning has advanced in the medical field and 
showed promising performance utilizing less annotated data but taking advantage of the 
availability of often large amounts of unlabeled samples20. For example, Husseini et al.21 
demonstrated that a self-supervised setup for CTC detection in a breast cancer cohort 
outperforms supervised approaches with only a fraction of the annotations needed. 
In this work and with the focus on differentiation of CTC and non-CTC images, we 
aim to bridge the gap between self-supervised and semi-supervised approaches with the 
introduction of a novel human-in-the-loop (HiL) strategy for providing additional 
meaningful training samples to an initial classifier. While Nanou et al.19 sampled from 
dense CTC and non-CTC latent space areas to increase the certainty of automatically 
pseudo-labeled data points, we hypothesize that sampling from areas with higher 
uncertainty is more beneficial since these areas are where most of the false classifications 
take place. This is intrinsically not accounted for by Nanou et al.19; for their approach,  the 
classification of cells within these regions remains uncertain. To enable rapid classifier 
adjustment upon the availability of new training samples, we combine a custom self-
supervised (self-distillation with no labels, DINO22) pretrained image encoder with a 
lightweight machine learning classifier (support vector machine, SVM) following the setup 
by Husseini et al.21 and Nielsen et al.20. The study builds on CS cartridge images from 90 
metastatic breast cancer patients. The proposed framework deploys the StarDist 
algorithm to extract single-cell crops from the cartridge images23. For cell classification, 
we combine both the advantages of state-of-the-art machine learning and human 
experience and intervention. We demonstrate the feasibility of the HiL strategy by 
experiments based on both simulations (simulated HiL) and with a human operator in the 
loop (real-world HiL). Our major contributions and major findings are: 
1) Detailed latent space analysis: We provide a detailed analysis of the latent space 
cell representations for metastatic breast cancer LB data and demonstrate that 
clusters with differing classification performance exist in the latent space. 
2) Proposal of an efficient HiL strategy: Based on finding (1), we introduce a novel 
iterative, local classifier performance-driven sampling and labeling strategy and 
demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness. 
3) Public availability of training framework and models: The complete framework (2), 
including model weights for the image encoder and a pipeline to generate cell 
images from cartridge ones, is made publicly available. 
 
Results 
Framework overview and the HiL principle 
The proposed framework consists of three main modules (Figure 1): single cell image 
extraction (Figure 1A); self-supervised image encoder training using unlabeled cell 
4 
images (Figure 1B); and cell classification based on the HiL principle (Figure 1A, lower 
part), utilizing a cluster analysis of the latent space cell representations (Figure 1C). 
 
Figure 1: Framework overview and the HiL principle. (A) The flowchart begins 
with a cartridge image from the CS system, where single cells are segmented and 
cropped using StarDist, and the available single-channel images are merged into 
a three-channel image. (B) The DINO network is trained with data from 60 patients, 
while 20 undergo classification using a conventional machine learning classifier 
(support vector machine, SVM) within the HiL framework (A). After training and 
evaluation, additional images were sampled from a relabeling pool and labeled by 
a human expert to boost classification performance. This process involves the 
proposed cluster-based approach and random resampling as a naive baseline 
approach. (C) The proposed cluster-based approach uses information from a 
cluster analysis based on labeled data to identify the clusters in the latent space 
with low F1 scores. Relabeled images are then included in the training pool. The 
HiL loop was applied four times. The remaining 10 patients (out of the 90) are not 
shown here and will be used later for the final evaluation of CTC detection 
performance of the proposed pipeline. Abbreviations and explanations: DAPI:

The extraction of the single cells starts with applying the StarDist algorithm23 to segment 
the cells in the CK channel of the cartridge images acquired by the CS system. The 
segmented cells are then cropped and organized in the order of DAPI, CK, and CD45 
channels to create three-channel images that define the input of subsequent deep 
learning systems. In the present study, this step is applied to all the image cartridges of 
all 90 breast cancer patients. 
The self-supervised learning (SSL)-based image encoder training followed the 
DINO principle. The SSL part was performed using data from 60 out of 90 patients. 
The learned representations of the DINO teacher backbone were then used for the 
addressed downstream task, that is, the classification of the single cell images (CTC vs. 
non-CTC). Based on the data of the 20 patients not used for the SSL part, an initial 
training pool as well as a test set were defined before initiating the HiL approach (see 
Methods part for details). The extracted features of the training set were used to fit an 
SVM classifier. Additionally, a designated relabeling pool was defined, consisting of 
samples from previously non-annotated data. 
The HiL strategy for drawing samples from the relabeling pool is depicted in Figure 
1C. The central idea was to target latent space clusters that showed a low classification 
performance, in this study the lowest F1 score, i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and 
recall. We contrasted this with a baseline approach where additional samples were 
randomly selected from the relabeling pool, independent of a cluster association. A 
human operator carried out relabeling of the new samples, and the labeled samples were 
added to the training pool to adapt the SVM decision boundary and re-evaluate the 
classification performance. For the performed experiments, the HiL loop depicted in 
Figure 1A (lower part) was applied four times. 
 
Cluster identification and characterization 
The cluster analysis aimed at the automatic identification of areas in the latent space with 
a low F1 score compared to other areas, i.e., areas with relatively many 
misclassifications. 
The results of the cluster analysis are summarized in Figure 2B. A total of five 
clusters with varying sizes and shapes were identified. Data points not assigned to any 
of these clusters were referred to as belonging to the background cluster. The 
meaningfulness of each cluster was then assessed, confirming that cell images within the 
same cluster exhibited similar characteristics. For example, cluster 1 contained cell 
images with rather small and point-like signals, both in the DAPI and CK channels, while 
cluster 2 primarily showed many DAPI signals in the background. Furthermore, cluster 0 
contained images where a shine-through effect occurs, originating from a strong 
fluorescence signal in the CK channel that extended into the CD45 channel24. 
Additionally, we observed images displaying artifacts such as smeared cells and noisy 
data spread across the clusters (Figure 2A). Upon this finding, an additional ML classifier 
was trained to preselect these images and to include only valid cell images in the 
subsequent classification task.  
Regarding the classification performance on the test set, we observed that each 
cluster contained varying amounts of misclassifications, with cluster 2 showing the 
6 
highest number of misclassified cells and the lowest F1 score (see red dashed box in 
Figure 2: Cluster identification and evaluation. (A) Displays representative cell 
images with corresponding DAPI, CK, and CD45 channels, including the overlap of 
DAPI and CK: a CTC (positive for DAPI and CK, negative for CD45), a non-CTC, a 
shine-through effect from CK to CD45 channel, and an artifact example. The left part 
of (B) displays the latent space of trained image encoder, reduced to two dimensions 
by a UMAP transform, for the labeled test and unlabeled training data. Clusters 
identified via clustering are highlighted by closed contours. Data points not assigned

F1 score, based on the labeled test data, is highlighted by a red dashed box.

Figure 2B). A closer inspection of cluster 2 revealed that the predominant 
misclassifications within and in the vicinity of cluster 2 were non-CTC predictions of cells 
that are determined as CTCs by human experts. 
 
Impact of sampling on classification performance 
The central hypothesis of the proposed HiL approach was that targeted sampling and 
labeling of additional cell images from automatically determined latent space areas, 
based on the F1 scores of the local areas, results in improved local and overall 
classification performance compared to fully random sampling.  
To investigate the hypothesis, three HiL experiments were performed: two 
simulated experiments in a controlled, idealized environment and one real-world 
experiment with a human expert who assigns labels to unseen data. All three experiments 
were based on the identified clusters shown in Figure 2B, left. The performance of the 
cluster-based strategy to complement the classifier training data set was compared 
against random sampling approaches. Each HiL experiment was repeated five times. The 
results are summarized in Figure 3A and Table 1. 
 
Simulated HiL scenario 1: limited global data 
The first experiment assessed the classification performance of the cluster-based HiL 
strategy when starting with a very limited classifier training data set. The initial training 
pool for this experiment consisted of a subset of only 100 labeled samples randomly 
selected from the labeled training set. During each simulated HiL loop, 100 additional 
labeled cell images were sampled and added to the classifier training pool. For the 
baseline approach, these images were randomly sampled. For the cluster-based strategy, 
new samples were drawn from the clusters with a frequency inversely proportional to the 
cluster-specific F1 scores before the respective HiL loop. 
Figure 3A shows that the cluster with the lowest initial F1 score was cluster 2 
(average F1 score for five repetitions of the experiment: 0.107; evaluation based on the 
test data set); the other clusters start with higher F1 scores. After four HiL loops, a 
noticeable classification improvement for cluster 2 is depicted using the cluster-specific 
approach, achieving an F1 score of 0.635. In contrast, the random sampling approach to 
enrich the SVM training data set reached only 0.260 after four iterations. The quantitative 
evaluation is supported by the qualitative impression of the latent space snapshots of 
cluster 2 and its proximate area (Figure 3A, lower panel): After initialization, many 
erroneous non-CTC predictions occurred, especially in the northern region of cluster 2 
while more erroneous CTC predictions appeared in the southern region. After HiL loop 4, 
the number of false predictions reduced, and the reduction of false non-CTC predictions 
was more apparent for the cluster-specific than for the random approach. 
Further, in both approaches, the F1 score increased for the majority of clusters 
after four HiL loops (see Figure 3A), albeit with less pronounced improvements than for 
cluster 2. For the cluster-based sampling approach, this can be explained by the 
proposed sampling strategy: With an increasing F1 score for cluster 2, the probability of

of drawing and labeling new samples from the other clusters increases for the available 
training for the individual. On average, the F1 score increased from initially 0.849 to 0.911 
for the cluster-based and 0.896 for the random approach after four HiL loops.  
 
Simulated HiL scenario 2: limited local data 
While the first experiment focused on challenges due to limited labeled training data in 
general, the second experiment addressed the challenge of limited training data for a 
specific local latent space area, i.e., a specific cluster. As the latent space captures the 
learned representation of the input images, this scenario corresponds to the situation that 
the images and cell representations of a new patient do not match the characteristics of 
the majority of the images and patients used for classifier training.  
To mimic this scenario, the number of training samples was cut to 20% of the 
original training data set size for one cluster (subsequently called the main cluster) and 
to 80% for the other clusters. Within each loop of the simulated HiL scenario, an additional 
20% of the main cluster training samples were added to the SVM training data set. As a 
comparison benchmark, the additional training samples were randomly drawn from the 
left-out samples of the other clusters and 20% of the left-out samples of the main cluster. 
  The experiments focused on cluster 2 (cluster with the most misclassification) 
and cluster 3 (largest cluster) as main clusters. The results are summarized in Table 1.

With cluster 2 as the main cluster, the cluster-specific HiL approach yielded a higher F1 
score (0.492 for cluster 2 after four HiL loops) than the random sampling strategy (F1: 
0.456). This trend was consistent for the entire testing set evaluation (cluster-specific HiL: 
F1 score of 0.921; random sampling: 0.919).  
With cluster 3 as the main cluster, the cluster-specific HiL strategy surpassed 
random sampling for both the main cluster (cluster-specific HiL: F1 score of 0.852, 
random sampling: 0.809) and the neighboring cluster 2 (cluster-specific HiL: 0.485, 
random HiL: 0.423). 
 
Real-world HiL experiment 
For the real-world experiment, the initial classifier training pool was the entire labeled 
training set. Additional samples for classifier refinement were drawn from unseen and 
unlabeled data, and the new samples were labeled by a human expert. The experiment 
focused again on cluster 2. Since most of the initial misclassifications in cluster 2 were 
erroneous non-CTC predictions, only new samples from cluster 2 that were classified as 
non-CTCs were considered for expert labeling. To enrich the SVM training dataset, only 
the subset of these samples categorized as CTCs by the human expert was used. The 
labeling time was limited to 5 minutes per loop (see Methods for further details).   
The results are summarized in Figure 3B. During the labeling periods, the expert 
identified in total 32 CTCs in the initially unlabeled samples of cluster 2 that were 
erroneously classified as non-CTCs. Albeit the small number of additional new SVM 
training samples, the proposed HiL strategy resulted in an increase in the F1 score for 
cluster 2 from initially 0.524 to 0.661 after four HiL loops, illustrating the efficacy of the 
proposed targeted sampling strategy. A similar random sampling strategy led to an F1 
score of 0.578 after four loops. This trend is further evident in the latent space. Snapshots 
of cluster 2 and its surroundings reveal relatively fewer misclassifications after the last 
loop for the cluster-specific strategy than for the random one (see Figure 3B, bottom). 
Small improvements in the F1 score were also noted in the neighboring clusters, such as 
cluster 3. Further, starting from an overall F1 score of 0.923 for the complete test set, the 
cluster-specific approach achieved a higher F1 score (0.930) than the random one 
(0.926). 
 
Application of final model 
To evaluate the CTC detection performance of the proposed training strategy, the final 
model of the cluster-specific real-world HiL experiment was applied to 10 additional 
patients. The performance of the proposed pipeline was compared to the CS system in 
terms of the number of identified CTCs and the positive predictive value. The latter is 
defined by how many of the cells and events, respectively, shown to the human observer 
are actual CTCs. The results are summarized in Table 2.

The overall number of actual CTCs identified across the 10 patients was comparable for 
both systems, whereas the positive predictive value of the proposed pipeline was 
noticeably higher for all patients, resulting in a lower number of false positive images that 
need to be analyzed. This, in turn, is less time-consuming for the human expert.  
In a subsequent analysis, the actual CTCs identified by both systems were 
examined to assess the overlap in CTC detection between the two systems and to identify 
any CTCs detected by only one system. For many patients, some CTCs suggested by 
the CS system were not detected by the proposed system (see Figure 4B) (CTCs found 
only by CS across patients: range: 2-18; average: 7), and vice versa (CTCs found only 
by proposed system: range: 0-26; average: 6). Exemplary CTCs found by the model but 
not by the CS system, are depicted in Figure 4A. Among these, there are CTCs with a 
relatively lower DAPI signal intensity (see the third CTC; A) or lower CK signal intensity 
(see the first and fourth CTC; A). Further, the CTC detected in the second row (A) exhibits 
a small DAPI signal but overlaps with the CK signal.

Discussion 
In recent years, multiple efforts have been made to automate the detection of CTCs. 
These include the application of machine learning techniques, encompassing supervised 
learning approaches17, semi-supervised methods19, and, taking up current trends in ML, 
for instance first self-supervised techniques21. Many of these developments address 
existing limitations posed by the FDA-cleared CS system, which is regarded as the 
reference and gold standard in this field: Due to the semi-automated nature of the CS 
system, it requires the intervention of a skilled human operator to select CTCs from 
sometimes a large number of images, introducing a time-intensive aspect to the process.  
While we acknowledge the efforts that aim at complete automation of CTC 
detection, we argue that leveraging human expertise will remain crucial, especially for the 
clinical application of such systems. We think that human input will remain essential 
especially in cases where ML system uncertainties arise, for instance, due to a mismatch 
of the training population and the specific patient and blood samples to be analyzed. 
However, in such cases, human expert input is also valuable to further optimize the ML 
system predictions, resulting in a human-in-the-loop (HiL) scenario.

In this study, we introduced a novel HiL strategy that bridges the gap between self-
supervised and semi-supervised methodologies. We combined a self-supervised DL 
feature extraction with a conventional ML classifier to perform a binary classification of 
CTCs and non-CTCs. Leveraging self-supervised feature extraction enabled us to learn 
comprehensive cell representations using a large amount of unlabeled data that is always 
available in related clinical settings. Using only a limited amount of labeled data enabled 
the identification of clusters in the latent space with low classifier performance. The latent 
space analysis then allowed us to generate (pseudo) labels for uncertain regions; to focus 
human efforts on labeling a limited set of new samples for classifier improvement only 
where they are most needed; and, thereby, to improve the classifier predictions and 
increase the ML system certainty. 
The feasibility and the advantages of the proposed strategy were demonstrated 
for liquid biopsy data of metastatic breast cancer patients. We showed the existence of 
distinct latent space clusters of cells of similar characteristics (shape, size, feature 
expressions) and observed differing system classification performances for the different 
clusters. The proposed iterative cluster-specific HiL strategy was compared to a random 
sampling approach that was independent of cluster associations of newly sampled data 
points. Across all our experiments, encompassing real-world HiL and simulated HiL 
experiments, we consistently observed a faster increase in classification accuracy in 
overall performance as well as in local performance, particularly for the cluster initially 
displaying the lowest F1 score, when employing the cluster-specific approach. 
Furthermore, the observed total classification accuracy of our framework was higher than 
the corresponding numbers reported by Nanou et al.19 for their testing set from metastatic 
breast cancer (precision on CTC: 0.938 vs. 0.814, recall on CTC: 0.923 vs. 0.793). 
Compared to CS, we showed that the proposed pipeline enables identification of a similar 
number of CTCs for patients that were not part of the training and optimization of the 
system but with a much smaller image gallery presented to the observer, i.e., a smaller 
number of proposed cell images and events that needs to be evaluated by the human 
expert. This, in turn, saves the time of the expert. 
From a clinical application perspective, the proposed HiL strategy in combination 
with latent space analysis enables the identification of latent space areas with higher 
classification uncertainty and proposes a targeted strategy to reduce uncertainty. This 
means that for each blood draw, the user can see whether the system accuracy can be 
expected to be high for the respective latent space cluster. If this is not the case, the user 
can ask the system to suggest potential CTC candidates for visual inspection that, based 
on the classifier probability threshold, are considered less certain CTC candidates. In the 
next step, the results of the expert evaluation can be fed back into the system to improve 
the classification performance for the cluster - and thus save time in the long term when 
again blood samples with similar characteristics are to be analyzed. 
 
Limitations of the study 
The current study focused on the feasibility and proof-of-concept of the proposed HiL 
strategy. The feasibility was demonstrated using liquid biopsy data from metastatic breast 
cancer patients. We further showed that the CTC detection performance of the proposed 
14 
pipeline is comparable to that of the CS while presenting less images to the human 
operator. CTCs detected by our approach but not by the CS system and vice versa may 
be attributed to the different thresholds applied by the two systems to the cartridge 
images. However, the exact reasons why one system detects a CTC when the other does 
not remain to be investigated. 
We propose expanding the scope of our present study to include other tumor 
entities, especially metastatic prostate or colon cancer, for which the CS system has also 
been approved. Further, so far, we used data with high CTC counts, which emphasizes 
the need to extend and evaluate our approach to patient data with lower reported CTC 
numbers and data of healthy blood donors. This is particularly important considering the 
predictive significance attributed to the current consensus threshold of 5 CTCs per 7.5 ml 
blood draw for both progression-free survival and overall survival13. The potential of the 
proposed framework in a comprehensive clinical setting has, therefore, to be investigated 
as future work.

Materials: data description 
Liquid biopsy data preparation 
This study is based on liquid biopsy data of 90 metastatic breast cancer patients, i.e., 
cartridge images obtained through the CS system. Cartridge images were obtained by 
transferring enriched and stained cells from a 7.5 ml whole blood sample into a cartridge, 
which is then subjected to a magnetic field to pull the cells in a single focal plane against 
a glass surface16. A fluorescence microscope then scans the cartridge and creates 175 
digitized cartridge images with a size of 1384 x 1036 px. Each cartridge image consists 
of three channels, representing the three applied staining agents: DAPI, CK and CD45. 
CTCs were detected in blood samples from patients with metastatic breast cancer 
(mBC) treated at the University Medical Center Heidelberg, Germany. CTC counts were 
determined by the CellSearch® approach in the Institute of Tumor Biology, University 
Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. CTC-analyses were approved by the 
ethical committee of the University of Heidelberg (case numbers S295/2009 and S-
164/2017; NCT05652569), and University of Mannheim (2010-024238-46) and by the 
ethic committee of the chamber of physicians of Hamburg (5392-3704-BO) and all 
patients provided their written consent. 
For detection and segmentation of single cells in the CS cartridge images, 
StarDist23 was applied, which has already been shown to be well suited for single cell 
segmentation in similar context25. In this study, the cells were detected and segmented 
based on the CK channel21. Based on the segmentation information, cropped three-
channel single cell images of size 48 x 48 px were generated. Further preprocessing (min-
max intensity normalization to a channel intensity range between 0 and 1) followed the 
protocol described by Husseini et al.21. 
 
Data split 
The processing and cell segmentation of the cartridge images of the 90 patients led to a 
total of 1.321.951 (three-channel) single cell images. 60 patients with 999,285 cell images 
were used for self-supervised training of the image encoder. 20 patients (274,542 cells) 
were used for solving the downstream task of binary classification of cells into CTCs and 
non-CTCs and respective experiments. 5,411 cells were labeled by two domain experts 
and evaluated by consensus, resulting in 2,773 CTCs and 2,688 non-CTCs. The 20 
patients were randomly split into 10 training (GT: 1,509 CTCs, 1,129 non-CTCs) and 10 
test patients (GT: 1,214 CTCs, 1,559 non-CTCs). The unlabeled cell images of the 
training patients were used as an unlabeled cell image pool for sampling and labeling 
additional cell images during the HiL experiments.  
Due to the presence of noisy images within the unlabeled training data set, i.e., 
images with channel signals that are hardly interpretable for the human observer, an SVM 
was trained on a small subset of the unlabeled images (400 images that were considered 
noisy by the human experts; 400 that were not noisy) to identify such samples. The trained 
16 
SVM was applied to the entire unlabeled training data set and noisy images were 
excluded. The refined and final unlabeled training data set comprised 48,312 samples. 
The remaining 10 patients with 48.124 cell images were set aside for the final 
evaluation of CTC detection performance of the proposed pipeline, compared to the CS 
system. 
 
Methods 
Self-supervised image encoder training 
Self-supervised DL image encoder training was based on the unlabeled single cell three-
channel images of 60 patients (999,285 images) using the public sparsam 
implementation20 of the DINO framework by Caron et al.22. 
Based on the concept of knowledge distillation between two DL models26 and 
building up on contrastive learning frameworks and momentum encoders27, the DINO 
framework consists of a teacher and a student DL model, both sharing the same 
architecture while being trained on different patch views of the same input image. As 
shown in Figure 1B, an input image is randomly cropped into two global and five local 
crops. The teacher receives only the global crops while the student obtains all crops. The 
objective of the training is to minimize a temperature-weighted categorical cross entropy 
between student and teacher model outputs, thereby learning a consistent representation 
of the different patches of the same input image. The student model parameters are 
optimized by stochastic gradient descent and the teacher model parameters are 
computed as running exponential mean of the student parameters22. 
Each model consists of a backbone network and a projection head that is only 
used during SSL training. The setup in this study follows the one of Nielsen et al.20 and 
Husseini et al.21 and deploys a cross-variance vision transformer (XCiT)28 as the 
backbone. Training was carried out for 30,000 iterations. After training, the teacher model 
backbone was applied to infer the image representations used for latent space analysis 
and image classification. 
 
SSL feature-based image classification 
Following the recent success of combining SSL-trained DL models and standard ML 
classifiers for image analysis for scenarios with only a few annotated data20, 21, an SVM 
with default scikit-learn parameters (except for: class weight=binary, cache size=10,000, 
probability=True, and breakties=True) was applied for the sought binary image 
classification (CTC vs. non-CTC) task. The input to the SVM was the representation of 
the single cell image as extracted by the trained teacher backbone model, which was 
further reduced from 128 to 32 dimensions by principle component analysis (PCA). The 
SVM was fitted to the labeled training data set. 
 
17 
Latent space cluster analysis 
The latent space cluster analysis was performed based on the PCA-reduced SSL image 
representations that were also used as inputs of the SVM. Following common practice29, 
30 a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was further applied to obtain 
a two-dimensional representation of the latent space. Clustering in this two-dimensional 
space was carried out using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications 
with Noise (HDBSCAN). HDBSCAN can automatically determine a suitable number of 
clusters and identify clusters with varying densities and shapes (e.g., compared to Density 
Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)31). Both properties were 
desirable in the present study, as little was known about the true data distribution, such 
as the true number of clusters and their characteristics. 
The cluster analysis was performed on the UMAP features of the joint unlabeled 
training and the test data set. While this might seem unintuitive at first glance, it serves 
an important purpose: to study local cluster effects in a real-world scenario (e.g., the real-
world HiL experiment), non-training data must be assigned to a cluster; therefore, test 
data must be included in the clustering process. Furthermore, to compensate for the 
limited size and potential biases when using only the labeled part of the test data set, we 
enriched the test set with the much larger and potentially more diverse unlabeled training 
set. During evaluation, data samples not assigned to any cluster by HDBSCAN were 
referred to as the background data. 
 
Proposed HiL strategy 
The underlying idea of the proposed HiL strategy was to improve labeling efficiency and 
classification performance by targeted automatic sampling and labeling new data points 
from latent space clusters with low(er) classification performance. The iterative process 
consists of the following steps: 
 
1. Initialization: A pool of unlabeled samples is defined, called relabeling pool, along 
with an initial training pool of labeled samples. Furthermore, a test set is prepared 
for evaluation purposes. 
 
2. Relabeling loop: The following steps constitute the loop and are repeated until 
the classification performance is satisfying or no more data are available in the 
relabeling pool: 
 
i. 
The classifier (SVM) is fitted to the labeled training samples. 
ii. 
The fitted classifier is applied to classify the labeled cell images of the test 
set. 
18 
iii. 
The local performance of the classification is evaluated for the latent space 
clusters and the labeled test set. In this study, the F1 score was used and 
computed for each cluster and the entire test set. 
iv. 
Cluster-specific sampling of new data points: Based on the classification 
performance for the different clusters, unlabeled samples are drawn from the 
relabeling pool. 
v. 
The drawn samples are presented to a human expert who assigns class 
labels. The labeled images are added as new data points to the training pool 
and removed from the relabeling pool. 
 
Experiments 
The working hypothesis of the proposed HiL strategy was that it allows improving 
classification performance with fewer new labeled samples compared to a naive, fully 
random sampling approach. The hypothesis was tested in two simulation experiments 
(simulated HiL scenarios 1 and 2, performed in an idealized environment) and a real-
world implementation of the strategy, involving a human expert and unseen new data 
(real-world HiL experiment). 
Each experiment comprised four relabeling loops and was repeated five times with 
different random seeds to study the robustness of the results. The classification 
performance was assessed by the F1 score for the different clusters and the overall F1 
score. 
 
Simulated HiL scenario 1: limited global data 
In the first scenario, classification improvement through local training data set adaptation 
was assessed when starting with very limited initial training data. For this simulation 
experiment, only 100 labeled samples were selected randomly from the labeled training 
pool to form the initial SVM training data set. The remaining labeled cells of the original 
training data set defined the relabeling pool for this experiment. During each relabeling 
loop, 100 additional samples were drawn from this pool, resulting in 500 samples after 
one completed HiL experiment (i.e., after four loops). During each loop, a 100-fold Monte 
Carlo (MC) cross-validation of the limited labeled training pool of this experiment was 
performed by splitting the data into MC-training (90%) and MC-validation (10%) for each 
step. All MC-validation results were then combined, and the classification performance of 
each cluster was evaluated in terms of the F1 score. For cluster-specific sampling, new 
samples were drawn from the relabeling pool and the clusters with a relative frequency 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 
inversely proportional to the associated MC-validation F1 score 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 of cluster 𝑖𝑖, 
 
𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖=
1 −𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖
∑1 −𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗
𝑗𝑗
 
 
19 
As a baseline comparison, a random sampling approach was simulated, where in 
each loop 100 new samples were randomly drawn from the entire relabeling pool of this 
experiment, agnostic of cluster performance. 
 
Simulated HiL scenario 2: limited local data 
The second experiment emphasized the scenario of limited labeled training data for a 
specific local area in the latent space in the initialization phase. For this scenario, the 
training data set of only a single cluster (referred to as the main cluster) was pruned to 
20% of its original size, while all others were limited to 80% of their original size. Due to 
the limited number of training samples for SVM fitting, the classification performance for 
the main cluster was hampered compared to the other clusters. During each relabeling 
loop, the next 20% of the labeled original training data set of the main cluster were 
randomly drawn (calculated based on 100% of the total available samples from the main 
cluster) until 100% (i.e., all labeled samples) of the main cluster were used for classifier 
fitting. 
For comparison purposes, the same initial labeled training set was defined, but we 
used 20% of the left-out labeled data for each cluster, including the main cluster, to form 
the relabeling pool. Sampling from the relabeling pool was then carried out randomly, with 
the number of drawn samples per loop given by the corresponding number for the cluster-
specific sampling strategy. 
This experiment was only conducted for the two most interesting clusters: cluster 
2, which represented the cluster with the lowest F1 score at initialization, and cluster 3, 
which represented the largest cluster. 
 
Real-world HiL experiment 
The real-world HiL experiment followed the same scheme as the simulated HiL but did 
not rely on artificially limited labeled classifier training data. Instead, new training data 
were sampled from initially unlabeled samples. That is, the initial classifier was trained on 
the entire labeled training data set, and the test set was used to evaluate the cluster-
specific classification performance.  
As for the relabeling pool, 1000 new samples were drawn from the unlabeled 
training set. We focused on the cluster with the initially lowest F1 score (cluster 2) and 
constrained the relabeling pool by sampling only from this cluster. For cluster 2, the low 
F1 score was mainly due to erroneous non-CTC prediction. We therefore limited the 
relabeling pool to samples for which the classifier predicted the cell to be non-CTC. 
Interested in mainly reducing the number of erroneous non-CTC predictions, the human 
expert was given 5 minutes to identify as many of these false predictions as possible, 
taking observer variability into account32. These were then, as new CTC examples, added 
to the classifier training pool.  
In the first HiL run, 32 new samples were labeled as CTC, with 11 samples in loop 
1, 10 samples in loop 2, 7 samples in loop 3, and 4 samples in loop 4. Since no further 
20 
CTCs were found, the new labeled samples were shuffled in the remaining repeated HiL 
runs, while maintaining the same number of new samples per loop. 
For the random sampling approach, also only non-CTC predictions from the 
unlabeled training set were sampled, but without considering their cluster association. 
Furthermore, only images that were initially predicted to be non-CTCs but were identified 
as CTCs by the expert were added to the training pools to match the cluster-specific 
experiment design. Furthermore, the number of added samples per loop was the same 
as for the cluster-specific experiment. 
 
 
Application of final model 
To assess the performance of the proposed HiL strategy for CTC detection, the final SVM 
model of the real-world cluster-specific HiL experiment (after four HiL loops) was applied 
to the remaining 10 patients who had not been used in the aforementioned experiments. 
Similar to the other experiments, the input for the SVM consisted of the PCA-reduced 
representations of single-cell images extracted by the trained teacher backbone model. 
CTC candidates were determined utilizing the SVM decision function with a confidence 
threshold of 0.5 (minor adjustments to 0.4 and 0.6 showed similar positive predictive 
values), and duplicate cells were automatically removed.  
Similar to the image gallery of the CS system, the suggested CTC candidates were 
presented to an expert, and CTCs were identified. For all patients, the same expert 
analyzed the CS image gallery and identified the CTCs therein. The number of CTCs was 
counted for both systems. For the identified CTCs, their coordinates in the CS cartridge 
image were extracted from the Extensible Markup Language (.xml) file generated by CS, 
and the fraction of CTCs that were identified in the image galleries of both systems was 
analyzed. Cells that were labeled as CTCs for one system and as non-CTCs for the other 
were taken into account during evaluation.
