Abstract
Background: Population-based cancer registries are required to calculate cancer incidence in a geographical area,
and several methods have been developed to obtain estimations of cancer incidence in areas not covered by a
cancer registry. However, an extended analysis of those methods in order to confirm their validity is still needed.
Methods: We assessed the validity of one of the most frequently used methods to estimate cancer incidence, on
the basis of cancer mortality data and the incidence-to-mortality ratio (IMR), the IMR method. Using the previous
15-year cancer mortality time series, we derived the expected yearly number of cancer cases in the period 2004–
2013 for six cancer sites for each sex. Generalized linear mixed models, including a polynomial function for the year
of death and smoothing splines for age, were adjusted. Models were fitted under a Bayesian framework based on
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The IMR method was applied to five scenarios reflecting different assumptions
regarding the behavior of the IMR. We compared incident cases estimated with the IMR method to observed cases
diagnosed in 2004–2013 in Granada. A goodness-of-fit (GOF) indicator was formulated to determine the best
estimation scenario.
Results: A total of 39,848 cancer incidence cases and 43,884 deaths due to cancer were included. The relative
differences between the observed and predicted numbers of cancer cases were less than 10% for most cancer sites.
The constant assumption for the IMR trend provided the best GOF for colon, rectal, lung, bladder, and stomach
cancers in men and colon, rectum, breast, and corpus uteri in women. The linear assumption was better for lung
and ovarian cancers in women and prostate cancer in men. In the best scenario, the mean absolute percentage
error was 6% in men and 4% in women for overall cancer. Female breast cancer and prostate cancer obtained the
worst GOF results in all scenarios.
Conclusion: A comparison with a historical time series of real data in a population-based cancer registry indicated
that the IMR method is a valid tool for the estimation of cancer incidence. The goodness-of-fit indicator proposed
can help select the best assumption for the IMR based on a statistical argument.

Background
The cancer incidence rate is an essential epidemiological
indicator in public health surveillance [1]. The calcula-
tion of cancer incidence requires a population-based
cancer registry with all new cases of cancer in the region
of reference, and given that population-based cancer
registries follow international procedures, the reliability
of their data in terms of exhaustiveness and validity is
guaranteed [2, 3].
The reference publication of observed cancer inci-
dence, Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5), col-
lects
cancer
incidence
data
from
population-based
cancer registries that comply with the quality standards
established by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC). Volume XI reports incidence data from
343 cancer registries in 65 countries for cancers diag-
nosed from 2008 to 2012 [4]. Despite the high number
of data registries and participating countries, the popula-
tion covered is less than 14.5% of the world population
census of 2010 (the central point of the study period).
Although cancer is a worldwide public health problem
and information regarding its incidence is necessary,
there are regions not covered by a population-based can-
cer registry. In those regions, it is necessary to use other
approaches to obtain incidence data that can be used in
the healthcare planning and epidemiological surveillance
of cancer. There are currently various initiatives that
have provided estimations of cancer incidence for Eur-
ope and the other continents [5, 6]. In Spain, estimates
have been published for 2015 for 25 cancer sites [7]
within the framework of a research project of the Span-
ish Network of Cancer Registries (REDECAN) (https://
redecan.org/redecan.org/es/index.html).
Some of the estimation methods used are very simple,
whereas others are more complex and based on model-
ing techniques. The choice of method is based on the
availability of the data (e.g., national incidence, national
mortality, regional incidence) according to the health
context of the region [8]. A comparison of the validity of
several estimation methods was recently published [9].
However, this study was limited to only 1 year, and an
extended analysis that goes beyond the estimation for a
single value is still needed. This would make it possible
to evaluate the stability of estimation methods, which
could be affected by the time fluctuations of the data
used.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive
performance
of
one
of
the
most
commonly
used
methods to derive cancer incidence rates from mortality
and incidence-to-mortality ratio (IMR) data, by compar-
ing expected cases with actual observed cases from the
Granada Cancer Registry [10], based on a historical
series. This method (IMR method) has been previously
used to obtain incidence estimation for Spain over
several time periods [7, 11, 12]. It was also the method
used in the GLOBOCAN and EUCAN projects to esti-
mate cancer incidence in Spain [8]. However, although
the IMR method is being widely used, a validation based
on a long time series has not yet been developed.
In addition, to further strengthen the method, we
propose a measure of goodness-of-fit (GOF) to help se-
lect the best scenario for the predicted behavior of the
IMR, which is a requirement for the application of this
method.
Methods
Study population
This estimation method used data from Granada, a
province in the southeast of Spain with a population of
approximately 920,000 inhabitants in 2013 [13]. All
deaths due to cancer between 1982 and 2010, according
to sex, age group, and anatomical site, were obtained
from the official death statistics of the Ministry of Health
of the Government of Spain, which exhaustively collects
all the medical certificates of death [14]. Population data
between 1982 and 2017 was obtained from the Spanish
National Institute of Statistics [13].
In addition, all incident cases diagnosed with cancer
between 1985 and 2013 in the province of Granada were
obtained from the population-based cancer registry of
Granada. This registry complies with all quality stan-
dards for the publication of its data in the CI5 from vol-
ume VI (1985–1987) to volume XI (2008–2012), which
is the most recent [4].
Cancer sites
Our study focused on six frequent cancer sites for each
sex as well as the total number of cancer incidence cases
(except for non-melanoma skin cancer), based on the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems: 10th revision [15]. More spe-
cifically, male cancers included stomach (C16), colon
(C18),
rectal
(C19–C20),
lung
(C33–C34),
prostate
(C61), bladder (C67, D09.0, D41.4), and other sites ex-
cept for non-melanoma skin (C00–C15, C17, C21–C32,
C35–C43, C45–C60, C62–C66, C68–C96). Female can-
cers included colon (C18), rectal (C19–C20), lung (C33–
C34), breast (C50), corpus uteri (C54), ovarian (C56),
and other sites except for non-melanoma skin cancer
(C00–C17,
C21–C32,
C35–C43,
C45–49,
C51–C53,
C55, C57–C96). The total number of estimated cancer
incidence cases (without non-melanoma skin cancer)
was obtained by adding the number of estimated cases
for all individual sites.
Estimation method
The method applied in our study was an adapted version
of the method using mortality data and mortality-to-

incidence ratios [16]. The most recent estimates of can-
cer incidence in Spain were calculated with this method
[7].
In
the
first
stage
of
our
study,
we
used
the
NORDPRED method [17] to estimate the number of
deaths that occurred in the target year for each sex and
anatomical site. This method uses age-period-cohort
(APC) modeling based on a power link function to pre-
dict the number of deaths:
Rap ¼ Aa þ D  p þ Pp þ Cc

5
ð1Þ
where Rap is the mortality for a specific age range (a)
during a specific period (p), Aa is the age component of
a specific age range (a), D is the common drift param-
eter reflecting the linear component of the trend, Pp is
the nonlinear period component of a specific period (p),
and Cc is the nonlinear cohort component in a specific
cohort (c).
In the second stage, the incidence-to-mortality ratio
(IMR) of the target year was estimated for each sex and
cancer type by means of a generalized linear mixed
model (GLMM). The number of incident cases was the
dependent variable, which was assumed to follow a Pois-
son distribution. The number of deaths was the offset of
the model whereas the independent variables were age
and year of cancer diagnosis. The effect of the year of
diagnosis was analyzed by means of a second-degree
polynomial function. The effect of age was smoothed by
means of a linear spline with four nodes (10th percentile,
first tertile, second tertile, and 90th percentile of the
mortality pool).
The estimation of the parameters of the models was
based on a Bayesian statistic approach using Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) [7]. The projec-
tion until the target year was then obtained from these
models, based on the assumed behavior of the IMR for
each cancer/sex combination.
The statistical software R was used, with the functions
of the NORDPRED method [17], and the BRugs package
[18] with OpenBUGS software [19, 20].
Assumptions regarding the mortality-to-incidence ratios
To obtain the estimation for the target year, it was ne-
cessary to make assumptions regarding the expected be-
havior of the IMR, based on the tendency observed and
the knowledge of the cancer studied. This study calcu-
lated the estimated number of cases based on each of
the following assumptions regarding IMR behavior,
resulting in the following five scenarios:
C1: The IMR remains constant from the last available
year.
C3: The mean of the last three available values of IMR
remains constant until the target year.
C5: The mean of the last five available values of IMR
remains constant until the target year.
L: The IMR has a linear trend that is projected onto
the target year.
Q: IMR has a quadratic trend that is projected onto
the target year.
Assumptions C3 and C5 are an extension of C1 in
which greater robustness was sought for the constancy
of the IMR, in order to minimize the effects of anecdotic
fluctuations.
Validity assessment
To assess the validity of the method, an iterative proced-
ure was implemented to obtain the longest possible
series of estimated values based on the mortality data.
The objective was to compare them with real observed
incidence data from the cancer registry.
The procedure aimed to reproduce the real-life con-
text where the estimations would be obtained. Accord-
ingly, in order to calculate the estimation for 2013 (the
most recent year with available incidence data), we used
a previous mortality series of 20 years (1991–2010) as
well as a 3-year projection (2009–2013) and an IMR
series of 15 years (1994–2008) with a 5-year projection
(2009–2013) (see Additional file 3: Figure S1). This situ-
ation simulated the most realistic scenario, depending
on the existing delay of the mortality records and the
cancer records for the current year (2–3 years and 5
years, respectively, although this delay relies upon differ-
ent factors, mainly legal and administrative contexts).
This procedure was repeated in a reverse year after
year until 2004, based on the available mortality and in-
cidence data in the study area (Additional file 3: Figure
S1). The end result of this iterative procedure was a
series of pairs of observed and estimated cases for each
year of the period 2004–2013. For each pair of values,
the relative deviation of the estimated cases was calcu-
lated with regard to the observed cases as:
100: Expected −Observed
Observed
ð2Þ
Please note that when the relative deviation is negative,
the number of observed cases was greater than the num-
ber of expected cases. Otherwise, the relative deviation is
positive.
Goodness-of-fit assessment
We used an indicator to assess GOF by comparing the
estimated
and
observed
cases.
The
aim
was
to
summarize in a single value the global fit of the method
across the time series by means of the mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) [21]. This GOF score was cal-
culated and compared for each combination of sex and

anatomical site and for all the scenarios for the assumed
behavior of the IMR.
The indicator MAPE for any period starting in year y1
and finishing in year y2 is defined in the following way:
MAPE sð Þ ¼
100
y2 −y1
ð
Þ þ 1
Xy2
i¼y1
Ei sð Þ −Oi
Oi


ð3Þ
where Ei(s) is the number of estimated cases for year i
under scenario s, and Oi is the number of observed cases
for year i.
This indicator reflects the deviation of the estimated
values from the real observed values across the time
series.
Therefore,
this
indicator
shows
which
assumption-based scenario is most suitable for each spe-
cific cancer site: scenario s1 will be considered better
than scenario s2 when MAPE(s1) < MAPE(s2).
Results
This analysis included 43,884 cancer deaths that oc-
curred between 1982 and 2010 in the province of Gran-
ada and 39,848 cancer incidence cases (23,197 in men
and 16,651 in women) diagnosed between 2004 and
2013 in the province of Granada.
The linear assumption for the IMR trend provided
the best GOF for prostate cancer in men, as well as
for cancer of the lung, ovary, and other sites in
women. The constant assumption (C1, C3, C5) was
better for the rest of the sites in both sexes (Table 1
and Figs. 1 and 2). In all cases (except for male blad-
der cancer), projecting the mean of the last 3–5 years
instead of the last IMR value improved the goodness-
of-fit results. In contrast, the quadratic assumption
had the worst GOF results in the cancer sites studied
(Figs. 1 and 2). The GOF indicator for prostate can-
cer was worse in all scenarios (Fig. 1). In females,
breast cancer and the “other” category also had worse
results than the rest of the sites studied (Fig. 2).
In the best scenario for every combination of sex
and anatomical site, the relative deviation of the num-
ber of estimated cases from the real cancer incidence
was −0.3% in men and −0.5% in women (Table 1).
For men, all the anatomical sites but the prostate
were underestimated, and more balanced results were
obtained for women, with overestimation for the cor-
pus uteri, ovary, and others and underestimation in
the colon, rectum, lung, and breast.
By specific cancer site, the relative deviation among
men ranged from −9.1% for rectal cancer to 11.6%
for prostate cancer during the entire period. For
women, the relative deviation ranged from −12.6% for
lung cancer to 14.3% for ovarian cancer. Considering
the relationship between annual average cases and
relative deviation, all anatomical sites except for the
ovary, corpus uteri, and lung in women and rectum,
other
sites,
and
prostate
cancer
obtained
results
within the expected range, depending on the number
of cases (Fig. 3).

values for the best scenario. For men, lung cancer ob-
tained the best approximations throughout the series with
an annual relative deviation of 4.5% (ranging from −10.1
to 14.1%). In contrast, prostate cancer had an annual aver-
age deviation of 27.4%, which was as high as 136% in the
last value of the series. For the rest of the sites, the fit was
acceptable with annual mean deviations of a maximum of
16.8% (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 4:
Figure S2). In the case of women, rectal cancer had the
worst estimations, with deviations of 19.2%. Breast cancer
shows an annual average deviation of 15%, although devia-
tions rise above 20% in the last years of the series, with the
expected cases underestimating the observed cases. The
rest of the anatomical sites obtained average deviation
percentages ranging from 10 to 20% (Additional file 2:
Table S2 and Additional file 5: Figure S3).
Regarding the total number of cancer cases, the
average annual deviation was −0.5% in both men and
women. Except for the last year of the series, the
relative deviation was lower than 8% in absolute
terms. In 2013, this deviation increased to 25% for
men and 5% for women, mainly due to the effect of
prostate
cancer
and
breast
cancer,
respectively
(Table 2 and Fig. 4).

Discussion
This research study analyzed one of the most frequently
used methods for estimating cancer incidence data world-
wide [6]. Although this method had been tested in previ-
ous research [9], it had never been validated with a long
dataset over time. In addition, until now, the best hypoth-
esis for the trend of the IMR had been selected solely on
subjective criteria. To address this issue, we proposed an
objective indicator to evaluate the goodness-of-fit in each
scenario. This indicator will facilitate decision-making re-
garding the assumed behavior of the IMR when this
method is applied in subsequent studies.
Our results showed that it is not advisable to use only
1 year for the IMR projection on the supposed constant
because this value could be very high or very low in
comparison with the normal trend and seriously bias the
results. It was observed that a quadratic assumption did
not work well for all sites in this analysis.
Similar to the national study, none of the scenarios ex-
amined seemed to fit IMR behavior with regard to breast
cancer and especially prostate cancer. This was also
reflected in the GOF indicator, which showed consider-
ably higher scores for these sites. For these sites where
no scenario was adequate, it is necessary to use new

strategies to get suitable estimations and re-evaluate
them using the same method. We believe that the IMR
method has important limitations when it comes to can-
cers with sudden fluctuations of the IMR due to a public
health intervention (e.g., a screening program, universal
or opportunistic) [8, 9]. This should be taken into ac-
count for any other anatomical site that is affected by an
early detection program in the study region.
In the best scenario, the results obtained in our study
show that the method based on mortality data and IMR
to derive cancer incidence cases provides good reliability
for most cancer sites. When the time period was consid-
ered as a whole, the relative deviation between the esti-
mated cases and real cases of cancer incidence in
relation to the total cancer cases was −0.3% in men (23,
126 expected cases vs. 23,197 observed cases) and −0.5%
in women (16,574 expected cases vs. 16,651 observed
cases). This low relative deviation was mainly caused be-
cause the relative deviations year by year were almost
canceled out.
In a comparative study that contrasted 9 estimation
methods with the number of actual cancer incidence
cases diagnosed in 2010 in Norway, the deviation for the
total number of cancer cases (using the same method)
was 10.4% for men and 9.6% for women [9]. In our
study, of the 14 sites studied, 7 showed absolute devia-
tions lower than 5%, and 10 had absolute deviations
lower than 10%. Only prostate cancer, corpus uteri

cancer, ovarian cancer, and female lung cancer had
values that exceeded this threshold. These results agree
with those obtained by Antoni et al. [9], in which even
higher deviations were obtained for these same sites.
Despite the limitations of this method in breast cancer
(because of the screening program in the period of
study, which affected IMR behavior), the relative devi-
ation of the expected from the observed cases was only
−1.1% overall (4175 expected cases and 4220 observed),
even though values higher than 20% were obtained in
the final years of the series. Prostate cancer showed a
less satisfactory result since the average overestimation
was 12%, and in the final year even reached 136%. These
results may be due to overdiagnosis produced by oppor-
tunistic screening with PSA tests and confirm that the
estimations for cancers affected by public health inter-
ventions should be interpreted with caution.
The method evaluated in this study has certain limita-
tions. On the one hand, all methods that use mortality,
survival, or IMR models are less precise when the num-
ber of cases or deaths is small, when the IMR is high,
and/or when there are sudden changes in the IMR in re-
lation to the period or age at diagnosis. For this reason,
cancers of the corpus uteri, ovaries, and lungs in women
obtained less satisfactory results than the other cancer
types. Moreover, screening may produce sudden changes
in the IMR in relation to age, time of diagnosis, and
province [22].
However, the method analyzed in this research also
had strengths. The use of recent data (3–5 years)
allowed us to obtain accurate estimations by applying
shorter projections, which minimized the risk of bias. In
addition, the use of data based on official mortality sta-
tistics and included in population-based cancer registries
guaranteed the quality of the information upon which
the estimations were based. The possibility of applying
different scenarios in the method made it sufficiently
versatile so that it could be adapted to the specific char-
acteristics of each cancer.
Conclusions
The comparison for the first time over a historical time
series between the obtained estimates and the real data
observed in a population-based cancer registry demon-
strated that the IMR method is a valid tool for cancer in-
cidence estimation, as long as the data (incidence,
mortality, and population) is of high quality. The optimal
scenarios proposed in this work could be used for the
application of the IMR method in other regions with
similar characteristics, such as the health system, the ex-
pected survival of patients, or the risk factors of cancer
in the reference population. The valuable work of
population-based cancer registries, which collect ex-
haustive incidence data, together with the application of
statistical techniques that are used to obtain both recent
and accurate estimations, will provide users with crucial
data for the surveillance of cancer in any region of the
world.
