Abstract
It is well-known that conditioning a supercritical (multi-type) branching process on the
event that it eventually becomes extinct yields a subcritical branching process.
We study
the corresponding inverse problem: given a subcritical branching process, does there exist a
supercritical branching process with the property that when we condition it on extinction, we
get back the original subcritical branching process? We show that such a supercritical branching
process (which we call a conjugate branching process) exists under mild hypotheses on the
original subcritical branching process. We also show by example that if there are at least two
types, then the conjugate branching process is not necessarily unique. Our results are relevant
to the problem of constructing natural random planar maps whose scaling limit is given by
supercritical Liouville quantum gravity. Moreover, conjugate branching processes can also be
used to give alternative evolutionary hypotheses in cancer modeling.

Introduction
1.1
Overview
Let d ∈N and consider a d-type branching process X = {X(n)}n∈N0, where X(n) = (X1(n), . . . , Xd(n))
is the vector which gives the number of individuals of types k ∈{1, . . . , d} in the nth generation.
For k ∈{1, . . . , d}, let Pk be the probability measure where we start with a single individual of type
k (i.e., Xk(0) = 1 and Xj(0) = 0 for j ̸= k), and let Ek be the corresponding expectation.
A classical fact in the theory of branching processes says that conditioning a supercritical
branching process on extinction gives a subcritical branching process. More precisely, let E be
the event that X(n) = 0 for all sufficiently large n, and assume that 0 < Pk[E] < 1 for each
k ∈{1, . . . , d}. Then the conditional law of X given E is that of a subcritical branching process.
See Proposition 2.1 below for a precise statement and [JL08, Theorem 1] for a more general result.
The branching process obtained by conditioning on extinction is sometimes called the conjugate
branching process.
In this paper, we will investigate the extent to which the operation of conditioning a branching
process on extinction is invertible. In other words, we will begin with a subcritical branching process
X, and ask whether there exists a supercritical branching process bX whose conjugate is X. As we
explain in Section 4.1, this question is relevant to the problem of constructing random planar maps
whose scaling limit is described by supercritical (a.k.a. strongly coupled) Liouville quantum gravity.
As an application in biology, we also explain in Section 4.2 how the conjugate branching process can
be useful in giving alternative evolutionary hypotheses in cancer modeling. However, we emphasize
that the proofs in this paper are completely elementary: no knowledge of Liouville quantum gravity
or biology is needed to understand the paper.
Definition 1.1. Let X = {X(n) : n ∈N} be a subcritical d-type branching process such that
the Pk-extinction probability is one for each k ∈{1, . . . , d}. A d-type branching process bX is
called a conjugate branching process for X if bX does not have the same law as X and for each
k ∈{1, . . . , d}, the conditional law of bX (started from a single individual of type k) given that it
eventually becomes extinct is the same as the Pk-law of X.
Our main result (Theorem 1.4) states that under mild conditions, a subcritical multi-type
branching process admits a conjugate branching process. By basic branching process theory, this is
equivalent to the existence of a fixed point for the generating function which lies in (1, ∞)d. We
note that the proof of the single-type case of our result is straightforward (see Proposition 1.6), but
non-trivial topological arguments, based on the Brouwer fixed point theorem, are needed to treat
the case when d ≥2.
We also give an example to show that the conjugate branching process is not unique, even for a
“generic” subcritical branching process (Example 1.5). Finally, we extend our result to the case of
branching processes with countably many types, see Section 3.
Remark 1.2. There are various ways to make sense of conditioning a subcritical or critical branching
processes on the (zero-probability) event that it never becomes extinct. The first approach was
introduced by Kolmogorov [Kol38] and Yaglom [Yag47], who considered the limiting behavior of the
process conditioned on non-extinction up to generation n as n →∞. In the single type subcritical
case, Yaglom [Yag47] showed that as n →∞, the distribution of {X(n)|X(n) > 0} converges to a
proper distribution. In the single type critical case, Yaglom [Yag47] showed that as n →∞, the
distribution of the rescaled process {Xn/n|Xn > 0} converges to an exponential distribution. The
multi-type analog was studied by [Har63, Jiř57, JS67, Mul63] in the case of finitely many types,
and [SVJ66] in the countable-type case. The second approach is conditioning the process on not
2
being extinct in the distant future, i.e. {X(n)|X(n + k) > 0} as k →∞. This leads to the so-called
Q-process, and was first studied by [LN68] in the single type case, and later by [DJ08] in the
multi-type case. For other ways to condition a (sub)critical branching process on non-extinction, see
Section 2.1 of [P´10]. The notion of a conjugate branching process considered in the present paper
is distinct from these concepts: a conjugate of a subcritical branching process is a supercritical
branching process, whereas conditioning a subcritical process on non-extinction usually leads to the
stationary behavior of the process and the resulting object is typically not a branching process.

Main result
Fix d ∈N and consider a d-type branching process X = {X(n)}n∈N0. If d ∈N, we define the
generating function f : (0, ∞]d →(0, ∞]d by
fk(q) := Ek


d
Y
j=1
qXj(1)
j


and
f(q) = (f1(q), . . . , fd(q)),
where
q = (q1, . . . , qd).
(1.1)
Note that we allow qj = ∞for some values of j, in which case we interpret ∞0 = 1 and ∞x = ∞
for x > 0. For n ∈N, let f(n) be the composition of f with itself n times. Equivalently, for
k ∈{1, . . . , d}, then kth component of f(n) is given by
f(n)
k
(q) := Ek


k
Y
j=1
qXj(n)


.
(1.2)
We also define the d × d matrix M whose k, j entry is
Mk,j := Ek[Xj(1)].
(1.3)
We assume that each Mk,j is finite. Then for n ∈N, the k, j entry of Mn is Ek[Xj(n)]. Recall that
the branching process is subcritical (resp. critical, supercritical) if the largest eigenvalue ρ of
M is less than one (resp. equal to one, greater than one).
The following are standard non-degeneracy conditions for multi-type branching processes, see,
e.g., [AN72, Section 6].
Definition 1.3. We say that X is positive regular if there exists N ∈N such that
Pk[Xj(N) ≥1] > 0,
∀k, j ∈{1, . . . , d},
which is equivalent to the condition that the matrix MN has all positive entries. We say that the
branching process is non-singular if there exists k ∈{1, . . . , d} such that

It is easy to see that if X is a subcritical, positive regular, and non-singular multi-type branching
process, then the existence of a conjugate branching process for X in the sense of Definition 1.1 is
equivalent to the existence of a point q ∈(1, ∞)d for which f(q) = q (see Proposition 2.2 below).
The main result of this paper is the following theorem.
Theorem 1.4. Consider a d-type branching process X = {X(n)}n∈N0 with generating function f
satisfying the following hypotheses.
3
I. X is subcritical, i.e., ρ < 1.
II. X is positive regular and non-singular (Definition 1.3).
III. For each k ∈N, the kth component fk of the generating function is a continuous function from
(0, ∞]d to (0, ∞] (with (0, ∞] equipped with the topology of a half-open interval).
Then there exists a conjugate branching process for X, equivalently, there exists q ∈(1, ∞)d such
that f(q) = q.
Hypothesis I is necessary for Theorem 1.4 to hold since a supercritical branching process
conditioned on extinction is always a subcritical branching process.
Hypothesis II just gives
standard regularity conditions. The most restrictive hypothesis is Hypothesis III. To see why
this hypothesis cannot be removed, we note that it is possible that the first two hypotheses hold
but that f(q) = (∞, . . . , ∞) for all q ∈(1, ∞)d. For a concrete example, consider the single-type
branching process with P[X(1) = m] = am−3 for m ≥1, and P[X(1) = 0] = b for appropriate
constants a, b > 0. We note that Hypothesis III is automatically satisfied if X is positive regular
and non-singular and fk(q) < ∞for all k ∈{1, . . . , d} and all q ∈(0, ∞)d.
Example 1.5 (Non-uniqueness). The conjugate branching process in Theorem 1.4 appears to be
unique for many simple examples of subcritical branching processes. However, it is not unique in
general, even for a “generic” choice of offspring distribution. As a fairly minimal example, consider
the case when d = 2 and the offspring distribution is given by
Pk[Xk(1) = 1, X3−k(1) = 0] = Pk[Xk(1) = 2, X3−k(1) = 0] = 1
4,
Pk[Xk(1) = X3−k(1) = 2] =
1
100,
Pk[Xk(1) = X3−k(1) = 0] = 49
100,
∀k ∈{1, 2}.
The branching process clearly satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 1.4, and one can check that the
equation f(q1, q2) = (q1, q2) has three solutions in (1, ∞)2. Furthermore, this example is robust in
the sense that if we slightly perturb the offspring distribution (e.g., we could add a small positive
chance to have more than three offspring of each type) then there are still three fixed points of the
generating function in (1, ∞)2. See Figure 1 for a visualization of why this example works. We also
have a similar example where d = 3 and there are seven fixed points in (1, ∞)d. In general, we
expect that for a fixed d, the number of fixed points of f in (1, ∞)d can be arbitrarily large.
Finally, we note that the analog of Theorem 1.4 in the case of a single-type branching process is
easy to prove, and one also gets that the fixed point is unique.
Proposition 1.6. Let X = {X(n)}n≥0 be a single-type branching process started from a single
individual and let f be its generating function. Assume that
I. X is subcritical, i.e., E[X(1)] < 1.
II. We have P[X(1) ≥2] > 0.
III. f is continuous from (0, ∞) to (0, ∞] (with (0, ∞] equipped with the topology of a half-open
interval).
Then there exists a unique conjugate branching process for X. Equivalently, there exists a unique
value of q > 1 for which f(q) = q.

of Example 1.5, made using Mathematica. The intersection points of these sets are the fixed points
of f.
Proof. Since f(1) = 1 and by Hypothesis III, there exists ε > 0 such that f(q) < ∞for all
q ∈[1, 1 + ε]. We have E[X(1)] = f′(1) < 1, so by Taylor expansion it follows that if s > 1 is
sufficiently close to 1, then f(s) < s. By Hypothesis II, there exists a sufficiently large t > 1 for
which f(t) > t. By Hypothesis III, there exists q ∈[s, t] for which f(q) = q. Since f′′(q) > 0 for all
q > 0 for which f(q) < ∞, we have that f is convex on the maximal interval where it is finite-valued.
Hence there are at most two values of q for which f(q) = q, namely 1 and q.
1.3
Proof outline
Our proof of Theorem 1.4, given in Section 2, is via an elementary topological argument. The basic
strategy is to reduce to a situation where we can apply the Brouwer fixed point theorem. To this
end, we will consider the basins of attractions defined by
S0 :=
n
λ ∈[0, ∞]d : lim
n→∞log f(n)(eλ) = 0
o
and S∞:=

λ ∈[0, ∞]d : lim sup
n→∞| log f(n)(eλ)| = ∞

,
where here logarithms and exponentials are applied componentwise, e.g., eλ = (eλ1, . . . , eλd).
With some work, we can show that each of S0 and S∞is relatively open in [0, ∞]d (Lemma 2.17).
This is the part of the proof which requires the continuity assumption on f appearing in Theorem 1.4.
We then consider the compact set Λ := [0, ∞)d \ (S0 ∪S∞). Using the openness of S0 and S∞
and the monotonicity properties of f established in Section 2.2, we show that each infinite ray
started from 0 which is contained in [0, ∞)d intersects Λ exactly once (Lemma 2.18). We note that
for this to be true, it is important that S0 and S∞are defined using f(eλ) rather than f(q) (see
Lemma 2.11).
From this, we deduce that Λ is a deformation retract of a collar neighborhood A of Λ which has
the topology of a closed disk (Lemma 2.19). The Brouwer fixed point theorem implies that every
continuous function from A to itself has a fixed point, so the same is true for Λ. It is clear that the
function g(λ) = log f(eλ) (with log applied componentwise) maps Λ to itself. From this we get that
g has a fixed point in Λ, which implies that f has a fixed point in exp(Λ) ⊂[1, ∞)d \ {(1, . . . , 1)}.
The positive regularity of the branching process implies that the fixed point is in fact in (1, ∞)d
(Lemma 2.3).
In Section 3, we establish a version of our theorem (Theorem 3.1) for a countable-type branching
5
process by taking a limit as the number of types goes to ∞. In Section 4.1, we discuss the applications
of our results to random planar maps and Liouville quantum gravity.

Proof of main theorem
2.1
Preliminaries on branching processes
We review some fairly standard facts about branching processes which are needed for our proofs. The
following is a precise statement of the fact that conditioning a (multi-type) supercritical branching
process on extinction gives a subcritical branching process.
Proposition 2.1. Let X = {X(n)}n∈N0 be a positive regular, non-singular d-type branching process
(Definition 1.3) with generating function f. Let E be the event that the process eventually becomes
extinct. For k ∈{1, . . . , d}, define the extinction probability
ak := Pk[E].
Then the only solutions of f(q) = q in the unit cube [0, 1]d are a = (a1, . . . , ad) and (1, . . . , 1).
Suppose that 0 < ak < 1 for every k ∈{1, . . . , d}. Then for each k ∈{1, . . . , d}, the Pk-
conditional law of X given E is that of a branching process with offspring distribution determined
by
Ek[F(X1(1), . . . , Xd(1)) | E] = 1

(2.1)
for every bounded measurable function F : Nd
0 →R. Moreover, this branching process is subcritical.
Proof. The proof is elementary: for details, see [AN72, Theorem 2, Section V.3] for the properties of
a and, e.g., [JL08, Theorem 1] for a description of the conditional law of X given E in a somewhat
more general setting.
We will be interested in the inverse operation of conditioning on extinction.
Proposition 2.2. Let X = {X(n)}n∈N0 be a positive regular, non-singular d-type branching process
(Definition 1.3) with generating function f. Assume that the extinction probability started from any
state is one. Let A ∈[1, ∞)d solve f(A) = A. Define a new branching process bX = { bX(n)}n∈N0
with offspring distribution determined by

∀k ∈{1, . . . , d}
(2.2)
for every bounded measurable function F : Nd
0 →R. Then the extinction probability for bX started
from an individual of type k is 1/Ak, and the bPk-conditional law of bX given the event that it
eventually becomes extinct is the same as the Pk-law of X.
Proof. Since f(A) = A, we see that (2.2) defines the offspring distribution for a branching process
bX. Since the law of the first n generations of bX is mutually absolutely continuous with respect to
the law of the first n generations of X, we obtain that bX is also positive regular and non-singular.
Let bf be the generating function for bX and write 1/A = (1/A1, . . . , 1/Ak) ∈[0, 1]d. By (2.2),
bf(1/A) = 1/A. By Proposition 2.1, it follows that 1/A is the vector of extinction probabilities for
bX and that the conditional law of bX given extinction is the same as the law of X.
6
Our next lemma implies in particular that in the setting of Proposition 2.2, the fixed point A
must either be equal to (1, . . . , 1) or be in (1, ∞)d.
Lemma 2.3. Consider a d-type branching process X = {X(n)}n∈N0 for which the extinction
probability started from any state is one. Let f be the corresponding generating function and let
q ∈(0, ∞)d solve f(q) = q. Then
qk ≥1,
∀k ∈{1, . . . , d}.
(2.3)
Moreover, if the branching process is positive regular, then either qk = 1 for every k ∈{1, . . . , d} or
qk > 1 for every k ∈{1, . . . , d}.
Proof. Let q ∈(0, ∞)d for which f(q) = q. By our extinction hypothesis, for every k ∈{1, . . . , d}, it
holds Pk-a.s. that limn→∞

Thus, (2.3) holds.
Now assume that the branching process is positive regular and there exists j∗∈{1, . . . , d} such
that qj∗> 1. Let N ∈N be such that Pk[Xj∗(N) ≥1] > 0 for every k ∈{1, . . . , d}. Then for every

since qj∗> 1 and Pk[Xj∗(N) ≥1] > 0.
The following elementary consequence of positive regularity and non-singularity will be used
frequently in our proofs.
Lemma 2.4. Let X = {X(n)}n∈N0 be a d-type branching process which is positive regular and
non-singular (Definition 1.3). There exists N ∈N such that for each k, j ∈{1, . . . , d},
pk,j(N) > 0
where
pk,j(N) :=
(
Pk[Xj(N) ≥1 and Xk(N) ≥1],
k ̸= j
Pk[Xk(N) ≥2],
k = j.
(2.4)
Proof. By positive regularity, there exists N0 ∈N such that
Pk[Xj(N0) ≥1] > 0,
∀k, j ∈{1, . . . , d}.
By non-singularity, there exists k0 ∈{1, . . . , d} such that each individual of type k0 has a positive
chance to have at least two offspring. Now let k, j ∈{1, . . . , d} be arbitrary. There is a positive
Pk-probability that we have at least one individual of type k0 in the N0th generation. Conditional
on this, there is a positive chance that we have at least two individuals (of any type) in the N0 + 1th
generation. Conditional on this, there is a positive chance that we have at at least one individual of
type k and one individual of type j (if j ̸= k) or at least two individuals of type k (if k = j) in the
2N0 + 1th generation. Thus the lemma statement holds with N = 2N0 + 1.
7
Finally, we need the following statement, which follows from the hypotheses of our main theorem.
Lemma 2.5. Assume the hypotheses of Theorem 1.4. There exists q0 ∈(1, ∞)d such that
fk(q0) < q0
k,
∀k ∈{1, . . . , d}.
Proof. Recall the matrix M from (1.3). Let ρ be the largest eigenvalue of M, which is strictly less
than one by our subcriticality hypothesis I. Also let v be the corresponding eigenvector, normalized so
that |v| = 1. Since we have assumed that our branching process is positive regular and non-singular,
the Perron-Frobenius theorem implies that each of the d components of v is positive.
Write 1 = (1, . . . , 1) for the vector of d ones. By our continuity hypothesis III and since f(1) = 1,
the function f is finite on a neighborhood of 1. Furthermore, M is the Jacobian matrix of f at 1.
By Taylor expansion, for ε > 0, we have
f(1 + εv) = 1 + ρεv + O(ε2),
as ε →0.
Since ρ < 1, this implies the lemma statement with q0 = 1 + εv for a small enough choice of
ε > 0.
2.2
Monotonicity properties
Throughout the rest of this section, we assume that we are in the setting of Theorem 1.4. In this
section, we will establish a number of monotonicity properties for the generating function which
will play an important role in our proofs.
Instead of working with the generating function f, for most of the proof it is more convenient to
work with the closely related function g defined as follows.
Definition 2.6. For λ = (λ1, . . . , λd) ∈(−∞, ∞]d, define
gk(λ) := log fk(eλ1, . . . , eλd)
and
g(λ) := (g1(λ), . . . , gd(λ)).
We also let g(n) be the composition of g with itself n times. Then, using (1.2), we see that the kth
component of g(n) is given by
g(n)
k (λ) = log f(n)
k
(eλ1, . . . , eλd) = Ek


k
Y
j=1
eλjXj(n)

.
(2.5)
We observe that
g(λ1, . . . , λd) = (λ1, . . . , λd)
if and only if
f(eλ1, . . . , eλd) = (eλ1, . . . , eλd).
(2.6)
Therefore, Theorem 1.4 is equivalent to the following statement.
Theorem 2.7. There exists λ ∈(0, ∞)d such that g(λ) = λ.
Although it will not be needed for our proofs, we remark that it is easy to see from Hölder’s
inequality that each gk is convex.
We will make frequent use of the following notation for componentwise inequalities.
Definition 2.8. For λ, η ∈(−∞, ∞]d, we write λ ≤η if λj ≤ηj for each j ∈{1, . . . , d}. We write
λ < η if λ ≤η and there exists j ∈{1, . . . , d} such that λj < ηj.
8
The following elementary fact will play a fundamental role in our proofs.
Lemma 2.9 (Monotonicity). Let λ, η ∈[0, ∞)d such that λ ≤η. Then, with g(n) as in Definition 2.6,
we have g(n)
k (λ) ≤g(n)
k (η) for each k ∈{1, . . . , d} and each n ∈N. Moreover, there exists N ∈N
such that if λ < η, then in fact g(n)
k (λ) < g(n)
k (η) for each k ∈{1, . . . , d} and each n ≥N such that
|g(n)(η)| < ∞.
Proof. The statement that g(n)
k (λ) ≤g(n)
k (η) for each k ∈{1, . . . , d} is immediate from the definition
of g(n).
To get the statement with strict inequality, let j∗∈{1, . . . , d} be such that λj∗< ηj∗. By
positive regularity (Definition 1.3), there exists N ∈N such that for each k, j ∈{1, . . . , d}, we
have Pk[Xj(N) ≥1] > 0. From this and the Markov property of the branching process, in fact
Pk[Xj(n) ≥1] > 0 for each n ≥N and each k, j ∈{1, . . . , d}. Therefore, for n ≥N, it holds
with positive Pk-probability that Qd
j=1 eλjXj(n) < Qd
j=1 eηjXj(n). By taking Ek-expectations, we get
g(n)
k (λ) < g(n)
k (η), provided g(n)
k (η) is finite.
We next show that the set of points λ ∈[0, ∞)d \ {0} for which |g(n)(λ)| remains bounded
away from 0 and ∞as n →∞is “unstable”, in the sense that slightly increasing or decreasing the
components of a point in this set will take us out of the set.
Proposition 2.10.
(i) Let λ ∈[0, ∞)d \ {0} and assume that lim supn→∞|g(n)(λ)| < ∞. If
η ∈[0, ∞)d such that η < λ, then limn→∞|g(n)(η)| = 0.
(ii) Let λ ∈[0, ∞)d \ {0} and assume that lim supn→∞|g(n)(λ)| > 0. If η ∈[0, ∞)d such that
η > λ, then lim supn→∞|g(n)(η)| = ∞.
The proof of Proposition 2.10 is based on the following lemma, which is a straightforward
consequence of the Vitalli convergence theorem.
Lemma 2.11. Let λ ∈[0, ∞)d \ {0} and assume that lim supn→∞|g(n)(λ)| < ∞. Then for any
r ∈[0, 1), we have limn→∞|g(n)(rλ)| = 0.
Proof. Write Zn := Qd
j=1 erλjXj(n), so that for k ∈{1, . . . , d},
g(n)
k (rλ) = log Ek[Zn].
Since the extinction probability is one (Hypothesis I), a.s. each Xj(n) is equal to zero for all
sufficiently large n, so a.s. limn→∞Zn = 1. By Hölder’s inequality,
Ek[Zn1(Zn>1)] ≤Ek[Z1/r
n ]rPk[Zn > 1]1−r = exp

rg(n)
k (λ)

Pk[Zn > 1]1−r.
Since limn→∞Zn = 1 a.s. and lim supn→∞g(n)
k (λ) < ∞, this goes to zero as n →∞. By the Vitalli
convergence theorem, we get that limk→∞Ek[Zn] = 1, which implies that limk→∞g(n)
k (rλ) = 0.
Proof of Proposition 2.10. First assume that ηj < λj for each j ∈{1, . . . , d}. Then there exists
r ∈(0, 1) such that η ≤rλ. By Lemma 2.11, this implies that limn→∞|g(n)(η)| = 0.
More generally, assume that we only have η < λ, i.e., ηj ≤λj for each j ∈{1, . . . , d} and at
least one of the inequalities is strict. By the second assertion of Lemma 2.9, there exists N ∈N
such that g(N)
k
(η) < g(N)
k
(λ) for each k ∈{1, . . . , d}. Since lim supn→∞|g(n)(g(N)(λ))| < ∞, we
can apply the first paragraph with g(N)(λ) in place of λ and g(N)(η) in place of η to get that
lim supn→∞|g(n)(η)| = 0. This gives assertion (i). Assertion (ii) follows by applying Assertion (i)
with the roles of λ and η interchanged.
9
We have the following minor generalization of Proposition 2.10.
Lemma 2.12. Fix m ∈N.
(i) Let λ ∈[0, ∞)d \ {0} and assume that lim supr→∞|g(rm)(λ)| < ∞. If η ∈[0, ∞)d such that
η < λ, then limr→∞|g(rm)(η)| = 0.
(ii) Let λ ∈[0, ∞)d \ {0} and assume that lim supr→∞|g(rm)(λ)| > 0. If η ∈[0, ∞)d such that
η > λ, then lim supr→∞|g(rm)(η)| = ∞.
Proof. Consider the branching process { eX(r)}r∈N0 where we observe the population only once every
m generations. That is, we set eXk(r) = Xk(mr) for each k ∈N. The lemma follows by applying
Proposition 2.10 to this branching process
Another useful consequence of Proposition 2.10 is the following lemma.
Lemma 2.13. Let λ ∈[0, ∞)d. If there exists m ∈N such that g(m)(λ) < λ, then limn→∞g(n)(λ) =
0. Moreover, if there exists m ∈N such that g(m)(λ) > λ, then limn→∞|g(n)(λ)| = ∞.
Proof. Let m ∈N such that g(m)(λ) < λ. By Lemma 2.9, we have
g(m+n)(λ) ≤g(n)(λ),
∀n ≥0
(2.7)
where here we set g(0)(λ) = λ. Furthermore, the inequality in (2.7) is strict if n is sufficiently large.
Hence, for each s ∈{0, . . . , m−1}, we have g((r+1)m+s)(λ) ≤g(rm+s)(λ) for each integer r ≥0. This
implies that for each such s, the limit
λ
s := lim
r→∞g(rm+s)(λ)
(2.8)
exists.
We claim that λ
s = 0. Assume for contradiction that λ
s > 0 (i.e., at least one component is greater
than zero). We have g(rm)(λ
s) = λ
s for each r ∈N, so in particular lim supr→∞|g(rm)(λ
s)| > 0.
Since the inequality in (2.7) is strict for large enough n, we have λ
s < g(s)(λ). Hence Lemma 2.12(ii)
implies that lim supr→∞|g(rm)(g(s)(λ))| = ∞, contrary to (2.8). Thus limr→∞g(rm+s)(λ) = 0 for
every s ∈{0, . . . , m −1}, which implies that limn→∞g(n)(λ) = 0.
The statement when g(m)(λ) > λ is proven similarly.
2.3
Basins of attraction of 0 and ∞
Our proof of Theorem 2.7 is based on splitting up space based on the large-n behavior of g(n). As
in Section 1.3, we define the following sets:
S0 :=
n
λ ∈[0, ∞]d : lim
n→∞|g(n)(λ)| = 0
o
and
S∞:=

λ ∈[0, ∞]d : lim sup
n→∞|g(n)(λ)| = ∞

. (2.9)
Note the asymmetry in the definitions: we have a lim in the definition of S0, but a lim sup in the
definition of S∞. The reason for this asymmetry comes from Proposition 2.10. We also note that
since our branching process is positive regular (Definition 2.8), there exists N ∈N such that if any
of the d coordinates of λ is equal to ∞, then g(N)(λ) = (∞, . . . , ∞). This implies that
[0, ∞]d \ [0, ∞)d ⊂S∞.
(2.10)
Lemma 2.14. We have g(S0) ⊂S0, g(S∞) ⊂S∞, g−1(S0) ⊂S0, and g−1(S∞) ⊂S∞.
10
Proof. This is immediate from the definition (2.9).
Our next goal is to prove that the sets S0 and S∞are open with respect to the topology of
[0, ∞)d (see Lemma 2.17 below). To do this, we will first show that 0 and ∞are attractive fixed
points of g, in the sense that S0 and S∞contain neighborhoods of 0 and ∞, respectively, in [0, ∞]d.
Lemma 2.15. There exists ε > 0 such that for each λ ∈[0, ε]d, we have limn→∞|g(n)(λ)| = 0.
Proof. By Lemma 2.5, there exists λ0 = (λ0
1, . . . , λ0
d) ∈(0, ∞)d such that g(λ0) < λ0. By Lemma 2.13,
this implies that limn→∞|g(n)(λ0)| = 0. By the monotonicity of g (Lemma 2.9), the lemma statement
holds with
ε :=
min
j∈{1,...,d} λ0
j > 0.
We next need a complementary statement for the behavior of g(n)(λ) when |λ| is large.
Lemma 2.16. There exists C > 0 such that the following is true. If λ ∈[0, ∞)d \ [0, C]d, then
g(λ) > λ and limn→∞|g(n)(λ)| = ∞.
Proof. Let N ∈N and pk,j(N) for k, j ∈{1, . . . , d} be as in Lemma 2.4. By Lemma 2.4, each
pk,j(N) is positive. Therefore,
m := min{pk,j(N) : k, j ∈{1, . . . , d}} > 0.
For λ ∈[0, ∞)d, the definitions of pk,j(N) and m imply that
exp(g(N)

Therefore, if minj∈{1,...,d} λj ≥C := log m−1, then g(N)(λ) > λ. By Lemma 2.13, this implies that
limn→∞|g(n)(λ)| = ∞.
Lemma 2.17. Define S0 and S∞as in (2.9). Then S0 and S∞are relatively open subsets of
[0, ∞]d.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be as in Lemma 2.15, so that
[0, ε]d ⊂S0.
(2.11)
Let λ ∈S0. By the definition of S0, there exists n ∈N such that g(n)(λ) ∈[0, ε)d. By Hypothesis III,
the function g(n) is continuous from [0, ∞]d to itself. Since [0, ε)d is a relatively open subset of
[0, ∞]d, the set (g(n))−1([0, ε)d) is a neighborhood of λ in [0, ∞]d. By (2.11) and Lemma 2.14,
(g(n))−1([0, ε)d) ⊂S0. Thus, S0 is relatively open.
To prove the statement for S∞, let C > 0 be as in Lemma 2.16. By that lemma and (2.10),
[0, ∞]d\[0, C]d ⊂S∞. Since [0, ∞]d\[0, C]d is a relatively open subset of [0, ∞]d and g(n) : [0, ∞]d →
[0, ∞]d is continuous, we can use exactly the same argument as in the case of S0 to conclude that
S∞is relatively open.
Our next goal is to show that [0, ∞)d \ (S0 ∪S∞) is a retract (in fact, a deformation retract) of
an open subset of (0, ∞)d with the topology of a closed disk. The key observation for this purpose
is the following lemma.
11
Lemma 2.18. Let u ∈[0, ∞)d with |u| = 1. There exists exactly one value of r ∈(0, ∞) such that
ru ∈[0, ∞)d \ (S0 ∪S∞).
Proof. Let L = {ru : r > 0} be the ray started at 0 which passes through u. By (2.9), the sets S0
and S∞are disjoint. By Lemma 2.17, the intersections of these sets with [0, ∞)d are open subsets
of [0, ∞)d. By Lemmas 2.15 and 2.16, L intersects both S0 and S∞. Since L ⊂[0, ∞)d is connected,
it follows that L must contain at least one element of [0, ∞)d \ (S0 ∪S∞).
Suppose by way of contradiction that L contains at least two elements of [0, ∞)d \ (S0 ∪S∞).
Then there exists R > r > 0 such that Ru, ru ∈[0, ∞)d \ (S0 ∪S∞). By the definition (2.9) of
S0 and S∞, we have lim supn→∞|g(n)(ru)| > 0 and lim supn→∞|g(n)(Ru)| < ∞. This contradicts
Lemma 2.11.

Illustration of the proof of Lemma 2.19 in the case d = 2. We construct a deformation
retraction from the region A (bounded by the two dashed curves) to the red set Λ = [0, ∞)2\(S0∪S∞)
by sliding points along rays through the origin.
Lemma 2.19. There exists R > r > 0 such that the set
A = A(r, R) :=
n
λ ∈[0, ∞)d : r ≤|λ| ≤R

(2.12)

and
B :=
n
λ ∈[0, ∞)d : |λ| = 1
o
.
By Lemmas 2.15 and 2.16, there exists R > r > 0 such that Λ ⊂A, with A as in (2.12). Henceforth
fix such a choice of r and R.
For λ ∈[0, ∞)d \ {0}, let π(λ) := λ/|λ| be the radial projection onto B. By Lemma 2.18, π|Λ
is a bijection from Λ to B. Obviously, π is continuous. By Lemma 2.17, the set Λ is a relatively
closed subset of [0, ∞]d. By Lemma 2.16, Λ is also bounded. Hence Λ is compact. Therefore, π|Λ is
a homeomorphism. Hence, there exists a continuous inverse ϕ : B →Λ such that
ϕ(u)/|ϕ(u)| = u,
∀u ∈B.
12
For λ ∈A and t ∈[0, 1], define
Ht(λ) := (1 −t)λ + tϕ
 λ
|λ|

.
(2.13)
We claim that H is a deformation retraction from A to Λ. Since ϕ is continuous, H is jointly
continuous in t and λ. By construction, for each λ ∈Λ, we have ϕ(λ/|λ|) = λ. Therefore, Ht(λ) = λ
for each t ∈[0, 1] and λ ∈Λ. Furthermore, for each λ ∈A, the points λ and ϕ(λ/|λ|) lie on the
same ray from 0 to ∞. Since Λ ⊂A, this gives
|Ht(λ)| = (1 −t)|λ| + t|ϕ(λ/|λ|)| ∈[r, R]
so each Ht maps A to itself. Finally, for each λ ∈A we have H0(λ) = λ and H1(λ) = ϕ(λ/|λ|) ∈Λ.
Thus H is a deformation retraction from A to Λ, as required.
Proof of Theorem 2.7. To lighten notation, as above we write Λ := [0, ∞)d \ (S0 ∪S∞). We first
argue that g(Λ) ⊂Λ. Indeed, if λ ∈[0, ∞)d and g(λ) ∈S0, then Lemma 2.14 implies that λ ∈S0.
Hence, λ /∈Λ. Similarly, if g(λ) ∈S∞, then λ /∈Λ. Hence, if λ ∈Λ, we must have g(λ) ∈Λ.
Let A be as in Lemma 2.19, so that Λ ⊂A. The set A is homeomorphic to a closed d-dimensional
Euclidean ball. By the Brouwer fixed point theorem, every continuous function from A to itself has
a fixed point.
Let h : A →Λ be a retraction, as given by Lemma 2.19. Since g(Λ) ⊂Λ, we have that
g ◦h : A →Λ. In particular, g ◦h is a continuous function from A to itself, so there exists λ ∈A
such that g(h(λ)) = λ. Necessarily, λ ∈Λ, so h(λ) = λ since h is a retraction. Thus g(λ) = λ.
Since 0 /∈S0, we have λ ∈[0, ∞)d \ {0}. By Lemma 2.3, in fact λ ∈(0, ∞)d.

The countable-type case
One can prove versions of Theorem 1.4 for branching processes with countably many types by,
roughly speaking, applying Theorem 1.4 and taking a limit as the number of possible types goes
to ∞. To illustrate this, we will prove one version of Theorem 1.4 in the countable-type case
(Theorem 3.1 below). However, it seems likely to us that there is not a single, elegant theorem
statement which covers all countable-type branching process which one might want to consider
simultaneously.
3.1
Countable-type branching processes
Consider a multi-type branching process X = {X(n)}n∈N0 with types indexed by k ∈N. We assume
that each individual has only finitely many offspring, i.e., for each k ∈N,
Pk


∞
X
j=1
Xj(1) < ∞

= 1.
(3.1)
For each k ∈N, we define f : (0, ∞]N →[0, ∞] by
fk(q) = Ek


∞
Y
j=1
qXj(1)
j

,
where
q = {qj}j∈N
(with the same conventions about ∞as in (1.1)) and we define the generating function
f(q) := {fj(q)}j∈N ∈[0, ∞]N.
13
We also define f(n) to be the composition of f with itself n times.
In contrast to the finite-type case, when there are infinitely many types, we need to distinguish
between global extinction, defined as limn→∞
P∞
k=1 Xk(n) = 0, and partial extinction, defined
as limn→∞Xk(n) = 0 for all k ∈N. Let q be the probability of global extinction and ˜q be the
probability of partial extinction. It can be shown that q ≤˜q ≤1, and both q and ˜q are solutions to
the fixed point equation s = f(s). Define S = {s ∈[0, 1]∞: s = f(s)}. Unlike the finite-type case
where S has at most two elements, it is showed in [BH19] that there exists countable-type branching
process with a continuum of fixed points. Extending d to N, the definitions of positive regularity
and non-singularity in Definition 1.3 also apply to the countable-type branching process X. If X is
irreducible and non-singular, it is proved in [Moy64, Theorem 3.1] that q is the component-wise
minimal element of S, and [BBHZ22, Theorem 3.1] that ˜q is the component-wise largest or second
largest element of S depending on whether ˜q = 1 or ˜q < 1. This implies that the concept of global
extinction parallels that of extinction in the finite-type case. In what follows, we will focus on global
extinction exclusively.
As in the finite-type case, conditioning an infinite-type branching process on global extinction
gives an infinite-type branching process with extinction probability one [JL08].
If the global
extinction probability for X is one, we can define a conjugate branching process for X in exactly
the same manner as in the finite-type case (Definition 1.1). Moreover, just as in the finite-type
case, conjugate branching processes correspond to solutions of f(q) = q in [1, ∞)N \ {0}. Indeed,
since the result of [JL08] applies also in the countable-type case, (2.1) in Proposition 2.1 still holds.
Replacing extinction with global extinction, the statement of Proposition 2.2 extends essentially
verbatim to the countable-type case, with the same proof. We remark that in the countable-type
case, the conjugate process has global extinction probability less than 1, but the partial extinction
probability may be 1.
We can approximate an infinite-type branching process by finite-type branching processes in
the following manner. For d ∈N, let Xd = {Xd(n)}n∈N0 be the d-type branching process obtained
from X by immediately killing each individual of type k ≥d + 1. In other words, an individual in
X corresponds to an individual in Xd if and only if each of its ancestors has type k ≤d. We call
Xd the branching process truncated at level d, and we denote all objects associated with Xd
by an additional superscript d. Note that Xd
k(1) = 0 if k ≥d + 1. Consequently, the generating
function fd = (fd
1 , . . . , fd
d ) for Xd is given by
fd

(3.2)
The idea of approximating a countable type branching process in this manner also appears, e.g.,
in [HLN13].
3.2
Existence of a conjugate branching process
Let us now state a list of assumptions which ensure the existence of a conjugate branching process,
equivalently, a fixed point for the generating function f in (1, ∞)N0.
I. (Fixed points for truncated processes). For each d ∈N, the truncated branching process
Xd satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 1.4.
II. (Bounded spatial growth). For each k ∈N, there exists αk > 1 and Ck > 1 such that for
each q ∈[1, ∞)N satisfying fk(q) ≤qk,
fk(qαk) ≤Ck
where
qαk := {qαk
j }j∈N.
14
III. (Bounded growth in k). There exist functions
ϕ, ψ : N →[1, ∞)
such that
lim
k→∞ϕ(k) = ∞
and
lim
k→∞
log ψ(k)
ϕ(k)
= 0
(3.3)
such that for each k ∈N,
fk(q) ≤ψ(k)[f1(q)]ϕ(k),
∀q ∈[1, ∞)N.
(3.4)
IV. (Subcriticality with weights). There exists ε > 0 such that
Ek

(1 + ε)
P∞
j=1 ϕ(j)Xj(n)

≤1 + ε,
∀k ∈N.
We think of ϕ(k) from (3.3) as the “weight” of an individual of type k. For various subcritical
branching processes arising from loop-decorated random planar maps, as discussed in Section 4.1,
we expect something similar to the above list of hypotheses to be satisfied with ϕ(k) taken to be a
constant multiple of the loop length k.
Theorem 3.1. Under the above assumptions, there exists q ∈(1, ∞)N such that f(q) = q.
We prove Theorem 3.1 by applying Theorem 1.4 and taking a (subsequential) limit. Recall the
truncated branching process Xd and its generating function fd from Section 3.1. As in Definition 2.6,
we define
g(λ) := log f(exp(λ)),
∀λ ∈(−∞, ∞]N0
and
gd(λ) := log fd(exp(λ)),
∀λ(−∞, ∞]d
(3.5)
where here log and exp are applied componentwise. To prove Theorem 3.1, it suffices to find
λ ∈(0, ∞)N0 such that g(λ) = λ (we can then set q = exp(λ)).
By Theorem 1.4, for each d ∈N there exists
λd = (λd
1, . . . , λd
d) ∈(0, ∞)d
such that
gd(λd) = λd.
(3.6)
If there is more than one fixed point for gd in (0, ∞)d, we choose one in an arbitrary manner. The
following lemma tells us that for each fixed k ∈N, the sequence {λd
k}d∈N is pre-compact.
Lemma 3.2. For each k ∈N, we have lim supd→∞λd
k < ∞.
Proof. Fix k ∈N. Since each Xd satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 1.4, we can apply Lemma 2.4
to Xk to find that there exists N ∈N (depending on k) such that
pk := Pk
h
Xk
k(N) ≥2
i
> 0.
Note that by the definition of Xd, we also have
Pk

k(N) ≥2

Due to Lemma 3.2, we can take a subsequential limit of each of the sequences {λd
k}d∈N to get a
sequence λ = {λk}k∈N ∈[0, ∞)N which is a candidate for a fixed point of g. The hardest part of
the proof of Theorem 3.1 is showing that λ ̸= 0. This is the purpose of the next lemma, and also
the place where we use Assumptions III and IV.
Lemma 3.3. There exists K ∈N such that
lim inf
d→∞
max
k∈{1,...,K} λd
k > 0.
Proof. Step 1: lower bound for a d-dependent value of k. We start by establishing a lower bound
for λd
k which holds for at least one value of k ∈{1, . . . , d}. This will be done using our strict
subcriticality assumption, Assumption IV. By that assumption, there exists δ > 0 (in particular,
δ = log(1 + ε)) such that

(3.7)
By the definition of gk, (3.7) is equivalent to
gk({δϕ(j)}j∈N) ≤δ,
∀k ∈N.
(3.8)
By (3.2) and since ϕ(k) ≥1 by definition (see (3.3)), this implies that
gd
k(δϕ(1), . . . , δϕ(d)) ≤δ ≤δϕ(k),
∀k ∈{1, . . . , d}.
(3.9)
By the monotonicity of gd,(n) (Lemma 2.9), the bound (3.9) implies that
gd,(n)
k
(δϕ(1), . . . , δϕ(d)) ≤δϕ(k),
∀k ∈{1, . . . , d}.
(3.10)
By Proposition 2.10, (3.10) implies that
lim
n→∞gd,(n)(η) = 0,
∀η ∈[0, δϕ(1)) × · · · × [0, δϕ(d)).
(3.11)
Since gd,(n)(λd) = λd for every n ∈N, it follows from (3.11) that for each d ∈N,
∃k(d) ∈{1, . . . , d}
such that
λd
k(d) ≥δϕ(k(d)).
(3.12)
Step 2: transferring to a lower bound for a bounded value of k. If k(d) were bounded above
by a constant, then (3.12) would yield the lemma statement. To deal with the possibility that
lim supd→∞k(d) = ∞, we will now establish a lower bound for λd
1 in terms of λd
k, for an arbitrary
value of k ∈{1, . . . , d}. This is done using our growth assumption, Assumption III.
For each d ∈N and each k ∈{1, . . . , d},
λd
k = gd

= log ψ(k) + ϕ(k)λd
1
(definition of λd and (3.2)).
(3.13)
Since limk→∞(log ψ(k))/ϕ(k) = 0, there exists K ∈N (not depending on d) such that
log ψ(k) ≤(δ/2)ϕ(k),
∀k ≥K.
16
If d ∈N such that k(d) ≤K −1, then (3.12) implies that
max
k∈{1,...,K} λd
k ≥λd
k(d) ≥δϕ(k(d)) ≥δ.
On the other hand, if k(d) ≥K, we combine (3.12) and (3.13) to get
log ψ(k(d)) + ϕ(k(d))λd
1 ≥λd
k(d) ≥δϕ(k(d)).
(3.14)
By our choice of K, we have log ψ(k(d)) ≤(δ/2)ϕ(k(d)), so (3.14) gives
λd
1 ≥δ

Proof of Theorem 3.1. By Lemma 3.2 and a standard compactness argument, there is a sequence
D of positive integers tending to ∞such that

Applications

Applications to Liouville quantum gravity
One motivation for studying conjugates of subcritical branching process comes from the theory of
random planar maps and Liouville quantum gravity. In this section we explain this motivation.
Loop-decorated random planar maps and their gasket decomposition
Let k ∈N. Consider a random planar map Mk with boundary of perimeter k (not necessarily
simple), decorated by a collection Lk of vertex-disjoint loops (simple cycles) on the dual map M∗
k.
We require that there is a special loop ℓ∂∈Lk which visits every face of Mk incident to ∂Mk. See
Figure 3, left, for an illustration. We note that similar statements to the ones in this subsection also
hold in slightly different setups.
(Mk, Lk)
Gk
Figure 3:
A loop-decorated random planar map (Mk, Lk) and its gasket Gk.
For a number of natural loop-decorated random planar maps (Mk, Lk) of this type, including
random planar maps decorated by versions of the O(n) loop model, the pair (Mk, Lk) can be
described by a multi-type branching process via the so-called gasket decomposition [BBG12a,
BBG12b,BBG12c].
To explain how this works, we define the gasket Gk of (Mk, Lk), i.e., the planar map obtained
from Mk by deleting each face which is visited by a loop in Lk \ {ℓ∂}, as well as each vertex, edge,
or face which is disconnected from ℓ∂by such a loop. See Figure 3, right. Then, for certain random
pairs (Mk, Lk), the loop-decorated submaps of Mk contained in the “holes” of Gk (i.e., the regions
where we removed faces) are conditionally independent given Gk. The conditional law of each such
loop-decorated submap enclosed by an outermost loop of perimeter p is the same as the law of
(Mp, Lp) (i.e., it is a loop-decorated random planar map sampled in the same way as the original
map, but with perimeter p instead of k). Finally, the conditional law of Gk given the lengths of the
holes in Lk is uniform over all possibilities.
By applying this iteratively, we get that the lengths of the loops in Lk are described by a
multi-type branching process. The type of each loop is its length. The starting loop (at time zero)
is ℓ∂. The offspring of each loop are the outermost loops in the submap it surrounds. For most
loop-decorated random planar maps considered in the literature, the planar map Mk is a.s. finite,
which implies that the extinction probability of this branching process is one.
18
In many interesting cases (including, e.g., random planar maps decorated by variants of the
O(n) loop model), if the parameters for the model are tuned to their critical values, then (Mk, Lk)
is believed to converge under an appropriate scaling limit to a γ-Liouville quantum gravity
(LQG) surface with the disk topology, with parameter γ ∈(
√
2, 2] decorated by a conformal
loop ensemble (CLEκ) with parameter κ ∈{γ2, 16/γ2}. We refer to [BP24,Gwy20,She23] for
introductory expository articles on LQG (including discussion of scaling limit conjectures for random
planar maps) and to [She09] for the definition of CLE. See also [MSW21,MSW22] for the continuum
analog of the gasket decomposition in the setting of CLE-decorated LQG.
Supercritical LQG
Recent works have initiated the rigorous study of LQG in the supercritical phase, which corresponds
to parameter values γ ∈C with |γ| = 2, or equivalently values of the central charge parameter
between 1 and 25 [GHPR20, DG23a, Pfe24, DG23b, AG23, BGS24].
This phase is much more
mysterious than the case when γ ∈(0, 2], even at a physics level of rigor, but is potentially more
interesting than the case when γ ∈(0, 2] from the perspective of string theory and Yang-Mills
theory (see [AG23, Remark 1.4] for further discussion of this point). Unlike LQG surfaces with
γ ∈(0, 2], supercritical LQG surfaces are not homeomorphic to two-dimensional manifolds. Rather,
supercritical LQG surfaces have infinitely many infinite spikes. More precisely, if we parametrize a
supercritical LQG surface by a domain U ⊂C, then there is an uncountable, Euclidean-dense, zero
Lebesgue measure set of “singular points” in U which lie at infinite distance from every other point
with respect to the supercritical LQG metric.
Particularly relevant to the present paper is [AG23], which gives a continuum analog of the
gasket decomposition for supercritical LQG surfaces decorated by CLE4. Unlike in the case when
γ ∈(0, 2], the continuous state branching process involved in this model has supercritical behavior,
e.g., in the sense that for every r > 0, the number of loops of supercritical LQG length at least
r in the nth generation a.s. goes to ∞as n →∞[BGS24, Proposition 3.1] (this is related to the
presence of infinite spikes in supercritical LQG surfaces).
It is natural to ask what sorts of random planar maps converge to supercritical LQG surfaces,
possibly decorated by CLE4. A natural first thing to try is to look at one-parameter families of
random planar map models which converge to γ-LQG for γ ∈(0, 2] and extend the range of allowable
parameter values. For example, one can look at random planar maps sampled with probability
proportional to (det ∆)−(26−c)/2, where ∆is the discrete Laplacian and c ∈(1, 25) is the central
charge.
However, heuristic arguments and numerical simulations suggest that many interesting random
planar maps obtained in this way behave like branched polymers, meaning that they converge in the
scaling limit to Aldous’ continuum random tree [Ald91] (which of course has very different geometry
from supercritical LQG). See [GHPR20, Section 2.2] and [BGS24, Section 1.1] for further discussion
and references related to the physics literature on this topic and [Fen23,BGS24] for some rigorous
results.
Constructing random planar maps via conjugate branching processes
A potential explanation for why various natural random planar maps converge to the continuum
random tree, instead of to supercritical LQG, was proposed in [GHPR20, Section 2.2] (using some
ideas from [APPS22]) and made rigorous for a class of random planar maps in [BGS24]. Loosely
speaking, the reason is that the random planar maps considered in the physics literature always
have a finite total number of vertices and edges. On the other hand, random planar maps whose
19
scaling limit is supercritical LQG should be infinite, with infinitely many ends1 (at least with high
probability). In particular, such random planar maps cannot be defined directly via a Radon-
Nikodym derivative with respect to the uniform measure on some countable set of possibilities
(which is the most common way to define random planar maps in the literature).
The first combinatorially natural family of random planar map models which should converge
to supercritical LQG was constructed in [AG23, Section 3.2]. These random planar maps are
constructed via a version of the gasket decomposition, but using a supercritical multi-type branching
process rather than a critical or subcritical multi-type branching process.
On the other hand, if we start with a random planar map which converges to supercritical LQG
and condition on the (small-probability) event that it is finite, then its scaling limit should be the
continuum random tree. This explains why various random planar maps which at first glance appear
to be related to supercritical LQG instead converge to the continuum random tree. This was made
rigorous for a class of random planar maps in [BGS24]. More precisely, [BGS24, Theorem 1.4] shows
that for a family of random planar maps believed to converge to supercritical LQG — constructed
from a supercritical multi-type branching process as in [AG23] — one does indeed have convergence
to the CRT when one conditions the map to be finite.
In summary, it is non-trivial to construct random planar maps whose scaling limit is supercritical
LQG. However, it is easy to construct random planar maps which should be obtained from random
planar maps which converge to supercritical LQG by conditioning on the event that the latter
random planar map is finite. Hence, to construct additional models of random planar maps which
converge to supercritical LQG, which are potentially more combinatorially natural than the ones
in [AG23,BGS24], we want to find a way to “invert the operation of conditioning a random planar
map to be finite”. In light of the gasket decomposition for random planar maps, and its continuum
analog for supercritical LQG and CLE4 from [AG23], a reasonable approach to achieving this is as
follows.
• Start with a natural model of finite loop-decorated random planar maps with boundary
which can be described in terms of a subcritical multi-type branching process via the gasket
decomposition. We expect that the scaling limit of this random planar map should be the
CRT.
• Find a canonical supercritical multi-type branching process (or a canonical family of super-
critical multi-type branching process) with the property that conditioning this supercritical
branching process on extinction gives us back the original subcritical branching process. In
other words, find a conjugate of the original branching process (in the sense of Definition 1.1).
• Construct a loop-decorated random planar map using the gasket decomposition, but with the
conjugate supercritical branching process in place of the original subcritical branching process.
This loop-decorated random planar map will be infinite, with infinitely many ends, with high
probability if the initial perimeter is large. Moreover, conditioning on the rare event that this
planar map is finite will give us back the original finite random planar map.
In order to carry out this procedure, one needs to understand when a conjugate for a subcritical
branching process exists, which is the question we consider in the present paper. The other major
step is a combinatorial analysis of the particular random planar map model in order to check the
criteria for a conjugate branching process to exist.
1An end of a graph G is a direction in which the graph extends to infinity. Formally, a ray is an equivalence class
of simple paths P : N →V(G), where two simple paths P and eP are declared to be equivalent if and only if there is a
finite set of vertices X of G and two distinct connected components A and B of G \ X such that A contains infinitely
many vertices of P and B contains infinitely many vertices of eP.
20
As a concrete example, we have reason to believe that this procedure should be applicable, and
should lead to a random planar map whose scaling limit is supercritical LQG, for four-valent planar
maps decorated by the six-vertex model in the case when the weight C assigned to each alternating
vertex satisfies C > 2. In the case when C ∈[0, 2], the scaling limit of this model is believed to be
critical (γ = 2) LQG [ZJ00,Kos00].
The potential non-uniqueness of conjugate branching processes (recall Example 1.5) is interesting
in the random planar map setting. It is reasonable to guess that for many natural models of finite
loop-decorated random planar maps, the conjugate branching process is unique, even though this is
not true for all multi-type branching processes. Another possible scenario is that for some models
of finite loop-decorated random planar maps, the conjugate branching process is not unique, and we
get multiple models of infinite random planar maps which all converge to supercritical LQG.
4.2
Applications to biology
Applications of multi-type branching process in biology also motivates our study of the conjugate
branching process. Multi-type branching processes provide a natural framework for studying how
different types of organisms within a population reproduce, interact, and contribute to overall
population growth. They have been particularly successful in modeling tumor growth. Below, we
explain how the conjugate branching process can be useful in this context.
Cancer growth modeled by a multi-type branching process
It is now well accepted that carcinogenesis is a multistage process. Cells accumulate mutations in
genes that increase their fitness, or replication rate, and ultimately transforming them into tumor
cells. This progression suggests that the clonal expansion of cancer cells can be modeled as a multi-
type branching process, where cells of the same type share a specific set of mutations and therefore
the same offspring distribution, and a cell produces cells of other types through additional mutations.
This branching mechanism has been observed in many human cancers, including leukemia, breast,
liver, colorectal, ovarian, prostate, kidney, melanoma, and brain cancers. See [DGN17, Section 6]
and the references therein.
By changing types and offspring distributions, multi-type branching processes can model a
range of cancer-related phenomena. In cancer initiation, types can represent stages in the cancer
progression. For example, colon cancer progresses through four steps. The first two steps are the
sequential inactivation of two tumor-suppressor genes. The third step is oncogene activation. The
final step is the inactivation of a “housekeeping gene” that regulates cell division and DNA repair.
This progression can thus be modeled as a four-type branching process. Moreover, drug resistance
can be modeled as a two-type branching process, with one type representing drug sensitive cells and
the other type representing drug resistant cells. Metastasis, the process by which cancer cells leave
the original tumor, spread to other parts of the body, and forms new tumors, can be modeled as a
three-type branching process. The three types are ordinary tumor cells, cells capable of metastasis
but haven’t done so, and cells that have spread to other locations. For detailed construction and
results, see [Dur15] and the references therein.
The above models can be summarized as a multi-type branching process as follows. Consider a
d-type branching process X = {X(n)}n∈N0 where X(n) = (X1(n), · · · , Xd(n)). At each time step,
a type j cell produces an offspring of the same type with probability bj, dies with probability dj, or
gives brith to an offspring of type j + 1 that acquires an additional mutation with probability uj.
We note that uj is related to the mutation rate, which typically ranges from 10−9 to 10−5 and is
significantly smaller than the other two probabilities. Most cancer models are in the continuous
21
time setting. However, for simulation purposes, discrete time model like the one considered here are
also used, for example in [BAO+10].
Conjugate branching process provides alternative evolutionary hypothesis
Cancer is a genetic disease. To understand the tumor growth in a specific patient, we need to
understand both the genotype and phenotype of cancer cells within the tumor. This is challenging
because tumor cells exhibit high heterogeneity and genotype-phenotype relationship in cancer is
still largely unknown. There are two categories of mutations during the natural progression of
cancer, driver mutations which provide a reproductive advantage to cancer cells, and passenger
mutations which do not contribute to cancer development directly and instead accumulate randomly
as the cancer cell replicates. In addition to driver mutations which initiate cancer, patients could
acquire lots of passenger mutations which are neutral and don’t alter the reproduction rate. When
the environment changes, as it does after cancer treatment, some passenger mutation may exhibit
resistance that allows cells to survive from the therapy. Finding passenger mutations is much easier
than driver mutations due to the vast genome, yet their high diversity complicates the assessment
of their roles in cancer evolution. To addressing these complexities, a feasible approach is to
first formally define the underlying assumptions of the tumor’s evolutionary dynamics and then
statistically evaluate these hypotheses as suggested in [SBG17, Section 4]. Bayesian inference is
particularly suited for this purpose. From the evolutionary hypothesis, we have prior knowledge
about model parameters. Using Bayesian inference, we can test how well the model explains the
observed data. The conjugate branching process can be useful in providing alternative evolutionary
hypothesis so that the model can be adjusted to better fit complex multi-dimensional data. As an
example, we illustrate how the conjugate branching process can help detect genotypes resistant to
cancer treatment at an early stage.
Currently, there is no universal cancer treatment effective for all patients with the same cancer
type. Treatment failure often results from drug resistance, which can either exist before treatment
(intrinsic resistance) or develop after treatment begins (acquired resistance). For example, targeted
therapy employs drugs or other agents to target specific changes in cancer cells that promote growth,
division, and spread. Despite often showing significant efficacy for most patients at the start, some
patients may exhibit insensitivity from the beginning due to pre-existing genetic alterations that are
resistant to the treatment. Moreover, some patients who respond well initially may later become
resistant because the majority of the tumor cells are sensitive to the treatment, but the resistant
cells would proliferate over time and result in recurrence. Early detection of potentially resistant
genotypes is therefore crucial, as it could inform timely adjustments in therapeutic strategies.
However, to pinpoint specific drug-resistant genotypes, there are two main difficulties. First, most
cancers require immediate treatment upon diagnosis. Therefore the evolutionary trajectory of a
tumor before treatment is generally unclear, except in a few well-studied cases like colorectal and
colon cancers. Second, there is extensive genomic diversity among cancer cells, and phenotype
such as drug resistance, does not have a one to one correspondence with genotypes. The conjugate
branching process offers a pathway to identifying genotypes present in current patients that may be
resistant to treatment, regardless of whether they emerged before or during initial therapy.
Suppose we use a multi-type branching process described above to model cancer evolution
after a specific treatment. Here, the number of types d corresponds to the number of distinct
phenotypes observed across patients. In cancer evolution, while it is feasible to measure genotypes,
phenotypes cannot be measured directly, and genotypes often include redundancies due to the
abundance of neutral mutations. We want to include all relevant types in cancer evolution without
overcomplicating the model. Thus, it is in practice a challenging task to select an appropriate
22
number of types in the multi-type branching model. To analyze the model, we estimate from data
the offspring distribution, or equivalently parameters (bj)d
j=1, (dj)d
j=1 and (uj)d
j=1. If this treatment
proves effective for a substantial fraction of patients, then the empirical offspring distribution may
suggest a subcritical multi-type branching process that is destined for extinction.
However, this is not true because an effective treatment does not guarantee complete eradication
of the cancer or prevent relapse in all cases. If a treatment is effective for a patient, it suggests
that the majority of their tumor cells do not have drug resistance mutations and the number of
cells decreases below a detectable threshold. Thus, observing data from a successfully treated
patient can be interpreted as conditioning on extinction. This implies that the subcritical empirical
offspring distribution we observe is the result of a supercritical branching process conditioned
on extinction. By Theorem 1.4, we know such supercritical processes exist. Moreover, since the
conjugate supercritical branching process is not unique, multiple evolutionary hypotheses may be
considered and need to be tested against data.
By setting the conjugate supercritical branching process as the evolutionary hypothesis, we can
further investigate the presence of intrinsic drug resistance and the likelihood of cancer recurrence.
Cancer cells may carry pre-existing passenger mutations that reduce their sensitivity to certain drugs.
It is possible to infer genotypes that are resistant to drug from the conjugate supercritical branching
process. Cancer often becomes undetectable when cell numbers fall below a certain threshold.
Recurrence can occur if residual cancer cells survive initial treatment and proliferate. With the
conjugate supercritical branching process, we can estimate the probability of cancer recurrence. It
can be approximated by the probability that the conjugate supercritical branching process starting
from an initial population of drug insensitive cells of size x proliferates and eventually surpasses the
detection threshold M. Here x is a lot smaller than M and M is typically of the order from 108 to
109 [DM09].
Multi-type branching processes have been widely applied in various fields, including the spread
of infectious diseases [Jac10,PJ12], gene amplification [HA91] and so on. Usually in the biology
context, the number of types is finite. The conjugate branching process can be useful in these
contexts. For any real-life phenomenon modeled by a multi-type branching process, empirical
data may sometimes suggest a subcritical process where the offspring distribution inherently leads
to population decline and eventual extinction.
However, it is also possible that the data we
observed is the result of a supercritical process conditioned on extinction. In cases where the latter
scenario is suspected, Theorem 1.4 provides mathematical justification for reconstructing the original
supercritical processes, allowing us to estimate the actual offspring distribution and gain clearer
insights into the underlying dynamics of the model.
