Abstract 
 
Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) marks a significant advancement over 
conventional energy-integrating detector (EID) CT systems. This review highlights PCCT's superior 
spatial and contrast resolution, reduced radiation dose, and multi-energy imaging capabilities, 
which address key challenges in radiotherapy, such as accurate tumor delineation, precise dose 
calculation, and treatment response monitoring. PCCT’s improved anatomical clarity enhances 
tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Additionally, metal 
artifact reduction (MAR) and quantitative imaging capabilities optimize workflows, enabling 
adaptive radiotherapy and radiomics-driven personalized treatment. Emerging clinical 
applications in brachytherapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) show promising outcomes, 
although challenges like high costs and limited software integration remain. With advancements 
in artificial intelligence (AI) and dedicated radiotherapy packages, PCCT is poised to transform

1. Introduction 
Computed Tomography (CT) imaging has revolutionized the field of medical diagnostics since its 
introduction in the 1970s (McCollough 2019). By combining multiple x-ray projections taken from 
different angles, CT creates detailed cross-sectional images of the body. These images provide 
crucial insights into the anatomical structures and pathological conditions, aiding in the diagnosis 
and management of various diseases. The high-resolution images generated by CT scans allow 
for precise visualization of bones, soft tissues, and blood vessels, making it an indispensable tool 
in modern medicine (Grüneboom et al 2019). 
The advancement of CT technology over the years has significantly improved image quality, 
reduced scan times and minimized radiation exposure. Innovations such as helical CT, multi-
detector CT, and iterative reconstruction techniques have enhanced the capabilities of CT 
imaging, enabling faster and more accurate diagnostics (Hsieh and Flohr 2021). These 
developments have expanded the applications of CT beyond traditional diagnostic purposes, 
paving the way for its integration into therapeutic procedures (Goitein et al 1979), particularly in 
cancer treatment workflows like radiotherapy. 
Radiotherapy, a cornerstone of cancer treatment, involves the use of high-energy radiation to 
destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. The success of radiotherapy heavily relies on 
precise targeting and accurate dose delivery, which are facilitated by high-quality imaging. CT 
scans are integral throughout the radiotherapy workflow, starting from the initial diagnosis and 
tumor localization to treatment planning and monitoring. By providing detailed anatomical 
information, CT scans enable clinicians to delineate tumors and organs-at-risk (OARs) accurately, 
which is crucial for developing effective treatment plans. Additionally, CT images are used to 
create three-dimensional (3D) models of the patient's anatomy, allowing for precise dose 
calculations and optimization of radiation delivery to target the cancer while minimizing dose to 
healthy nearby organs. 
Despite its critical role, conventional CT imaging has limitations that can impact the accuracy and 
effectiveness of radiotherapy. These include suboptimal contrast resolution, artifacts, and the 
inability to provide functional information (Pereira et al 2014). Moreover, conventional CT 
systems struggle with accurate differentiation between tissues of similar density, which is 
particularly important for radiotherapy delivered by proton beams, and are prone to beam-
hardening artifacts, which can compromise image quality. Addressing these challenges is essential 
to further enhancing the precision and outcomes of radiotherapy.  
Photon-Counting CT (PCCT) offers promising solutions to overcome the limitations of 
conventional CT and significantly improve the radiotherapy process. PCCT represents a paradigm 
shift in medical imaging, particularly in the context of cancer treatment. By offering enhanced 
spatial and contrast resolution, reduced artifacts, and the ability to perform multi-energy imaging 
(Willemink et al 2018, Flohr et al 2020), PCCT can produce advanced images, such as virtual 
monoenergetic images (VMIs), iodine maps, and virtual non-contrast (VNC) images. These 
capabilities are particularly useful for radiotherapy, where precise tumor delineation and dose 
calculations are critical. Iodine maps, for example, can act as surrogates for tumor perfusion, 
allowing clinicians to monitor treatment response and track changes in tumor vascularization 
during radiotherapy. Furthermore, the ability of PCCT to generate data on relative electron 
density and effective atomic number directly supports more accurate dose calculations, 
improving treatment planning and overall outcomes. The integration of PCCT into clinical practice 
promises to advance the precision and efficacy of cancer treatments, marking a significant step 
forward in personalized medicine. 
While significant advancements have been made in CT technology, reviews discussing PCCT often 
focus on its applications in radiology and diagnostic medicine. There is a noticeable gap in the 
literature examining its potential within the radiotherapy context. Existing reviews and studies 
tend to emphasize technological innovations of PCCT or Dual-Energy CT (DECT) (Willemink et al 
2018, Jacobsen et al 2020, Flohr et al 2020, Si-Mohamed et al 2021, Farhadi et al 2021, Kruis 
2022, Douek et al 2023, Wehrse et al 2023, van der Bie et al 2023). However, there is a lack of 
focused analysis linking these technological advancements to practical applications in 
radiotherapy. This review aims to fill this void by offering a detailed exploration of how PCCT can 
enhance the precision and efficacy of radiotherapy, thereby providing a valuable resource for 
clinicians, researchers, and physicists seeking to optimize cancer treatment outcomes. 
Figure 1 below illustrates the growing body of literature related to PCCT in recent years, showing 
its increasing popularity across various medical applications. However, despite this growth, its 
application in radiotherapy remains significantly underexplored. Given PCCT’s potential to 
address key challenges in radiotherapy—such as improving tumor targeting and dose accuracy—
this gap presents a critical opportunity for further research and clinical integration. The rising 
interest in PCCT across other medical disciplines signals its transformative potential in 
radiotherapy, making it an essential area for future exploration.

2. Data Collection 
To ensure a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature on PCCT and its applications 
in radiotherapy, we employed a structured data collection approach. Our methodology involved 
the following steps: 
Database Search: We utilized PubMed as our primary database for sourcing relevant articles. The 
search query used was “(Photon counting OR Spectral Photon counting) AND CT) AND 
(radiotherapy OR radiation therapy)”. The search was conducted for articles published up to 
September 10th, 2024. 
Filtering Process: The initial search yielded a total of 155 articles. To refine the results, we applied 
the following filters: 
1. Publication type: Peer-reviewed articles 
o Language: English 
o Relevance: Articles that specifically address the use of PCCT in the context of 
radiotherapy 
After applying these filters, we obtained a subset of 97 articles. 
Independent Citation Analysis: To ensure the inclusion of highly relevant and influential studies, 
we conducted an independent citation analysis. This process involved reviewing the reference 
lists and citations of the initially selected articles. By examining the papers cited frequently by our 
selected articles, we identified additional key studies that contributed significantly to the field. 
This method allowed us to uncover influential research that may not have appeared in the initial 
search results. 
Final Selection: The final selection comprised 110 articles, which were thoroughly reviewed and 
analyzed to extract relevant data and insights on the advancements, applications, and impact of 
PCCT in radiotherapy. These articles provided a comprehensive understanding of the current state 
of research and potential future directions in this domain. 
Limitations of the Search: While PubMed is a comprehensive database, it may not capture all 
relevant articles, especially those published in less mainstream journals or in languages other 
than English or manuscripts published on arXiv. Additionally, the focus on English-language 
articles may have introduced a language bias, potentially excluding relevant studies published in 
other languages.

3. Physics of Photon-Counting Detectors vs. Energy-Integrating Detectors 
To understand the advancements brought by PCCT, it is essential to delve into the fundamental 
differences between photon-counting detectors (PCDs) and conventional energy-integrating 
detectors (EIDs). 
Energy-Integrating Detectors (EIDs): Traditional CT systems are energy-integrating (i.e., EICT), 
which measure the total energy deposited by x-ray photons. When the detector material absorbs 
incoming x rays, the resulting electrical signal is proportional to the total energy deposited. This 
signal is then integrated over a set time period to form the image (Fig. 3 A). The materials used in 
EIDs typically include scintillators and photodiodes. Common scintillator materials are made of 
materials like cesium iodide (CsI) or gadolinium oxysulphide (GOS), which convert x-ray photons 
into visible light. The visible light is then detected by photodiodes, such as amorphous silicon (a-
Si) photodiodes or photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), which convert the light into an electrical signal. 
This signal is collected and processed to create the final CT image. The choice of scintillator 
material affects the detector’s efficiency, spatial resolution, and sensitivity to x rays. The pixel 
sizes in EIDs generally range from 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm, which limits spatial resolution, especially 
when capturing fine details. 
Limitations of EIDs: 
1. Noise and Resolution: EIDs are susceptible to electronic noise, which can degrade image 
quality. They also have limited spatial resolution because the scintillator crystals and 
photodiodes in the detector are relatively large, and light crosstalk between pixels must 
be minimized using reflecting septa. This design inherently limits the detector's ability to 
capture fine spatial details. 
2. Energy Discrimination: EIDs do not differentiate between photons of different energies. 
This lack of energy discrimination can lead to suboptimal contrast resolution and reduced 
ability to distinguish between different tissue types. 
3. Beam Hardening Artifacts: EIDs are prone to beam hardening artifacts, where lower 
energy photons are preferentially attenuated as compared to higher energy photons, 
leading to undesirable contrast variations and streaking artifacts in the image. 
Photon-Counting Detectors (PCDs): In contrast, PCDs represent a significant technological 
advancement because they directly count individual photons and measure their energy. When an 
x-ray photon interacts with the detector, it generates an electrical pulse whose amplitude is 
proportional to the photon’s energy. These pulses are counted and categorized based on their 
energy levels (Fig. 3 B). The materials used in PCDs are crucial for their performance and typically 
include semiconductor materials like cadmium telluride (CdTe) or cadmium zinc telluride (CZT). 
These materials have high atomic numbers and are effective at converting x-ray photons into 
electronic signals. In a PCD, the semiconductor material is usually configured into an array of small 
pixels, each capable of detecting x-ray photons and measuring their energy with high precision. 
The pixel sizes in PCDs are much smaller, typically ranging from 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm, allowing for 
significantly improved spatial resolution. The signal generated by each pixel is then processed to 
produce detailed images with enhanced contrast and spatial resolution. The use of these 
advanced materials allows PCDs to achieve superior energy resolution and higher image quality 
compared to traditional EIDs. 
 
Advantages of PCDs: 
1. Ultra-High Spatial Resolution: PCDs offer higher spatial resolution compared to EIDs, 
allowing for more detailed and precise imaging PCDs offer higher spatial resolution 
compared to EIDs, allowing for more detailed and precise imaging because each pixel in 
the detector is smaller and more sensitive to individual photons. This fine pixelation, 
combined with the ability to count and categorize photons directly, results in sharper 
images with improved edge definition, which is crucial for detecting small lesions or fine 
anatomical details. 
2. Superior Contrast Resolution: By discriminating between photons of different energies, 
PCDs provide superior contrast resolution, enabling better differentiation between 
tissues. 
3. Reduced Noise: PCDs inherently reduce electronic noise because they count individual 
photons, resulting in clearer and more accurate images. 
4. Multi-Energy Imaging: PCDs can perform multi-energy imaging in a single scan, providing 
rich spectral information that can be used to better characterize tissue composition. 
5. Artifact Reduction: PCDs help reduce beam hardening artifacts by enabling more precise 
energy discrimination. By counting and categorizing photons at different energy levels, 
PCDs allow for better differentiation of materials, minimizing the appearance of beam 
hardening artifacts and resulting in clearer, more reliable images. 
 
Figure 3. Schematic Overview of CT Detectors: A. Energy-integrating detectors convert incoming x-ray photons into 
visible light, which is then transformed into an electrical signal by photodiodes. The signal for each projection is 
obtained by integrating all detected photons within that projection. The spatial resolution of these detectors is 
influenced by the use of reflecting septa to minimize crosstalk between detector elements. B. Photon-counting 
detectors generate an electron-hole pair when a photon interacts with the semiconductor material. The anode 
attracts the electrons from this pair, producing an electrical pulse whose amplitude corresponds to the energy of the 
incoming photon. Unlike EIDs, where pixel size and photon integration over time limit spatial resolution, PCDs offer 
continuous photon sampling and count individual photons, resulting in higher spatial resolution and enhanced image 
quality. Adapted from (van der Bie et al 2023) 
 
Rajendran et al (Rajendran et al 2022) demonstrated that PCCT offers significant advantages over 
traditional EICT in coronary CT angiography. In their study involving a 71-year-old man (Fig. 4), 
PCCT enabled multi-energy imaging with 66-msec temporal resolution, which is not possible with 
EICT. The 45- and 55-keV VMIs generated by the PCCT system exhibited higher iodine signal levels 
(1164 HU at 45 keV and 800 HU at 55 keV) compared to the 90 kV EID CT images (724 HU), despite 
the PCCT using 22% less iodine contrast material (90 mL vs. 110 mL). Additionally, the PCCT iodine 
maps provided clear visualization of the left coronary artery without motion blur, a significant 
improvement over EICT. The inability of EICT to create VMIs, iodine maps, and VNC images at this 
temporal resolution highlights the superior capabilities of PCCT in cardiac imaging, particularly 
for applications requiring detailed multienergy data. The VNC image, shown in the bottom row, is 
generated by subtracting iodine from contrast-enhanced data to simulate a non-contrast image 
without requiring a separate scan. In this case, the VNC image shows 72 HU in the region of 
interest, closely resembling traditional non-contrast images but derived from the same contrast-
enhanced dataset. 
Figure 4. Images in a 71-year-old man scanned with (A) energy-integrating detector (EID) based CT and (B, C) PCCT. 
The multienergy capabilities of the PCCT system allowed the creation of low-energy virtual monoenergetic images 
(VMIs) (B), showing increased iodine signal and better delineation of coronary arteries compared to single-energy 
EICT (A). The bottom row (C) also includes a Virtual Non-Contrast (VNC) image, created by subtracting iodine from 
the contrast-enhanced dataset, which effectively mimics a non-contrast image. Reconstruction kernels and display 
settings varied between EICT and PCCT. This figure has been adapted from the work of Rajendran et al (Rajendran et 
al 2022) with permission from the journal. 
 
Rajagopal et al (Rajagopal et al 2021) conducted a study comparing the quantitative image quality 
of PCCT to traditional EICT across various low-dose levels in phantoms. Using an investigational 
scanner equipped with both PCCT and EICT subsystems, they evaluated image quality at dose 
levels of 1.7, 2, 4, and 6 mGy CT dose index volume (CTDIvol), all of which are at or below the 
doses typically used for conventional abdominal CT. The results demonstrated that PCCT 
significantly outperformed EICT in terms of image quality. Specifically, PCCT images showed a 
22.1%−24.0% reduction in noise across the dose levels, leading to a 29–41% improvement in 
contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and a 20–36% enhancement in detectability index. Furthermore, for 
iodine detection, PCCT consistently provided higher CNR across all doses and iodine 
concentrations evaluated.  
Similarly, Stein et al (Stein et al 2023) investigated the impact of PCCT on small vessel stent 
visualization compared to traditional EICT. Their study found that PCCT with a dedicated sharp 
vascular kernel (Bv56) provided superior image quality compared to EICT in phantom. The highest 
diagnostic confidence was observed with PCCT, particularly in terms of sharpness and reduced 
blooming artifacts, which are critical for accurate stent assessment. The study also demonstrated 
that PCCT could potentially reduce the need for invasive coronary angiograms by improving non-
invasive imaging quality.  
The fundamental differences between EIDs and PCDs underscore the transformative potential of 
PCCT in radiotherapy. By overcoming the limitations of traditional EIDs—such as noise, resolution, 
and artifact issues—PCDs pave the way for enhanced imaging capabilities that are particularly 
beneficial in the precise delivery of treatments.  
4. Spectral CT: Dual-Energy CT (DECT) vs. Photon-Counting CT (PCCT) 
Multi-energy CT (MECT), as described by Rajiah et al (Rajiah et al 2020), involves acquiring two 
or more CT measurements with distinct energy spectra, enabling a more detailed differentiation 
of tissues and materials than conventional CT. This advanced imaging technique leverages the 
energy-dependent attenuation properties of x-ray photons to enhance tissue characterization and 
improve diagnostic accuracy. The two primary modalities of Spectral CT are Dual-Energy CT 
(DECT) and PCCT, each utilizing distinct technological approaches to exploit spectral information. 
These modalities allow for advanced imaging techniques such as K-edge imaging, Z_eff mapping, 
VNC imaging, and VMI.  
Sauerbeck et al (Sauerbeck et al 2023) in their review, demonstrated that Spectral CT's advanced 
imaging capabilities, especially in oncology, offer significant advantages for radiotherapy planning 
and monitoring. By generating virtual unenhanced images, iodine maps, and VMIs, Spectral CT 
enables more precise detection and characterization of tumors. In the context of radiotherapy, 
these capabilities can be used to improve the accuracy of tumor delineation and treatment 
response assessment. For example, iodine maps, which act as a surrogate for tumor perfusion, 
can be utilized to monitor the effectiveness of radiotherapy by tracking changes in tumor 
vascularization. Additionally, the ability to calculate relative electron density and the effective 
atomic number from Spectral CT data is crucial for accurate dose calculation and optimization in 
radiotherapy planning.  
Dual-Energy CT (DECT) 
Principles: DECT operates by acquiring CT images at two different energy levels, typically using 
either two distinct x-ray sources or by rapidly switching between high and low-energy x rays 
during a single scan. This dual-energy data enables differentiation of tissues based on their unique 
energy-dependent attenuation characteristics, making it possible to achieve material 
decomposition and enhanced contrast resolution. 
Applications and Advantages: 
• 
Material Differentiation: DECT is particularly effective in distinguishing between different 
types of tissues and materials. For example, it can differentiate iodine from calcium, which 
is valuable in vascular imaging and in identifying calcifications. In radiotherapy, this 
capability can improve the accuracy of tumor delineation by better distinguishing tumors 
from surrounding healthy tissues or calcifications, which is critical for precise dose 
delivery. 
• 
Enhanced Contrast Resolution: By analyzing attenuation at two different energy levels, 
DECT enhances contrast resolution, making it easier to visualize structures such as blood 
vessels, tumors, and other soft tissues. For radiotherapy, this improved contrast can lead 
to more accurate identification of the tumor boundaries and organs-at-risk (OARs), 
optimizing treatment planning and minimizing radiation exposure to healthy tissues. 
• 
Artifact Reduction: DECT can help reduce beam-hardening artifacts and other common 
CT artifacts, leading to improved image quality. This is particularly important in 
radiotherapy, where artifact-free images are essential for accurate tumor localization and 
dose calculation. 
• 
Functional Imaging: DECT enables functional imaging, such as iodine mapping in 
perfusion studies, which provides additional diagnostic information on tissue perfusion 
and vascularity. In radiotherapy, iodine maps can serve as a surrogate for tumor perfusion, 
allowing for dynamic monitoring of treatment response and adaptation of the treatment 
plan based on changes in tumor vascularity. 
Recent advancements further extend DECT’s capabilities. Peng et al (Peng et al 2024) introduced 
an unsupervised-learning framework for material decomposition in DECT, addressing one of its 
biggest challenges: noise amplification during material decomposition. This deep-learning-based 
model demonstrated significant noise reduction (up to 97%) without requiring paired data, 
enhancing DECT’s potential for quantitative imaging in radiotherapy applications. Similarly, Gao 
et al (Gao et al 2024) employed a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (C-DDPM) 
to generate synthetic contrast-enhanced DECT (CE-DECT) images from non-contrast single-
energy CT (SECT) scans. This method is especially useful for patients who are at risk from 
iodinated contrast agents, and for institutions lacking DECT scanners, offering a novel solution 
for radiation therapy planning with minimal imaging risks. 
Photon-Counting CT (PCCT) 
Principles: PCCT employs PCDs that count individual x-ray photons and measure their energy 
directly. This direct measurement allows for precise energy discrimination, high-resolution 
imaging, and the acquisition of multi-energy data in a single scan. 
Applications and Advantages: 
• 
Ultra-High Spatial Resolution: PCCT offers superior spatial resolution by counting 
individual photons and minimizing electronic noise, which improves the clarity of images. 
In radiotherapy, this high spatial resolution is critical for accurately delineating small 
tumors and detailed anatomical structures, ensuring precise dose delivery and minimizing 
radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. 
• 
Superior Contrast Resolution: The ability of PCCT to perform direct energy discrimination 
leads to improved contrast resolution, allowing for finer differentiation between tissues. 
This is particularly valuable in radiotherapy for distinguishing between tumors and nearby 
organs-at-risk (OARs), helping to define treatment volumes more precisely and improving 
the safety and efficacy of treatment planning. 
• 
Multi-Energy Imaging: Unlike DECT, which is limited to two energy levels, PCCT can 
acquire data across multiple energy bins simultaneously, providing more comprehensive 
spectral information. In radiotherapy, this multi-energy capability can be used for 
advanced tissue characterization, enabling more precise adjustments to treatment plans 
based on the varying tissue properties and improving the accuracy of dose calculations. 
• 
Artifact Reduction: PCCT significantly reduces common artifacts, such as beam hardening, 
resulting in clearer and more accurate images. In radiotherapy, artifact-free images are 
crucial for precise tumor localization, ensuring that the treatment targets only cancerous 
tissue and avoids damage to healthy structures. 
• 
Quantitative Imaging: PCCT enables precise quantitative imaging, such as calculating 
electron densities and tissue compositions, which is highly useful for dosimetry in 
radiotherapy. This quantitative data enhances the accuracy of treatment planning by 
allowing more refined calculations of radiation dose distributions, leading to improved 
treatment outcomes. 
A recent study by Ren et al (Ren et al 2024) evaluated the spectral imaging performance of a 
clinical PCCT system for single- and dual-contrast materials in comparison to DS-DECT. The study 
showed that while PCCT provided useful spectral imaging capabilities, DS-DECT with 70/Sn150 kV 
or 80/Sn150 kV offered superior accuracy in two-material decomposition tasks. For instance, 
root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values for iodine and gadolinium were lower in DS-DECT 
compared to PCCT, especially in dual-contrast tasks. This highlights that while PCCT holds great 
promise, it may still be outperformed by advanced dual-energy techniques like DS-DECT for 
certain clinical applications. The greater spectral separation in DS-DECT's energy levels likely 
contributed to its improved material decomposition performance, particularly in complex 
imaging scenarios. 
Moreover, Deng et al (Deng et al 2024) explored the integration of PCCT in dual-contrast imaging, 
demonstrating the ability to differentiate between iodine and gadolinium in clinical scenarios. 
Their findings revealed that PCCT is particularly advantageous in three-material decomposition, 
where RMSE values were within clinically acceptable ranges for complex tissue compositions. 
This capability underscores the potential of PCCT to advance multi-contrast imaging, particularly 
in oncology where precise material differentiation may be vital for tumor delineation and therapy 
monitoring. 
Table 1 compares the key features and advantages of DECT and PCCT, illustrating the technological 
differences in terms of energy acquisition, spatial and contrast resolution, artifact reduction, and 
quantitative imaging capabilities. Figure 5 further illustrates these advancements by comparing 
VNC images from PCCT and EICT. The PCCT image shows reduced noise, better delineation of 
small structures, and overall enhanced image quality, which is critical for applications like tumor 
targeting and segmentation in radiotherapy.

• 
Z_eff Imaging: The effective atomic number (Z_eff) of tissues can be calculated using DECT 
and PCCT, aiding in tissue characterization and material differentiation. This is crucial in 
distinguishing between materials with similar attenuation coefficients at specific energies 
(Landry et al 2013). PCCT's ability to acquire data across multiple energy bins may further 
refines Z_eff imaging, potentially contributing to more accurate treatment planning and 
outcome prediction in radiotherapy. This technique is especially valuable in Stereotactic 
Radiosurgery (SRS) cases, where patients may not be eligible for magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and CT with iodine contrast is used instead. Z_eff imaging can enhance 
tumor delineation by better characterizing iodine, which crosses the blood-brain barrier 
and localizes in small tumors. Given the tight contour margins and the risk of 
radionecrosis, precise target delineation is critical for effective treatment. By improving 
the contrast of iodine uptake, PCCT Z_eff imaging offers a more accurate alternative in 
such cases, where CT contrast resolution is typically poorer compared to MRI. 
• 
Virtual Non-Contrast (VNC) Imaging: VNC imaging subtracts the iodine component from 
contrast-enhanced images, providing an image similar to a non-contrast scan (Mergen et 
al 2022). This technique eliminates the need for a separate non-contrast acquisition, 
reducing the patient's radiation exposure and the risks associated with repeated 
administration of contrast agents. VNC imaging is particularly useful in radiotherapy, 
where multiple imaging sessions may be required. For example, in Liver SBRT cases, where 
CT contrast between the tumor and surrounding liver tissue is often poor, VNC imaging 
can improve the visualization of the target without additional contrast exposure, helping 
clinicians avoid repeat contrast-enhanced scans. 
• 
Virtual Monoenergetic Imaging (VMI): VMI generates images at single energy levels, 
offering improved contrast at specific keV levels (Li et al 2021). This technique is available 
in both DECT and PCCT and is beneficial in enhancing contrast resolution and reducing 
artifacts. In radiotherapy, VMI can be used to optimize image contrast for better 
visualization of tumors and surrounding tissues, aiding in precise targeting and dose 
delivery. For example, a study conducted on monoenergetic CT images from dual-energy 
scanning by (Pawałowski et al 2019) demonstrated that images reconstructed at 70 keV 
offered the best combination of low contrast resolution, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR). This suggests that 70 keV might be the optimal energy level for delineating 
structures in radiotherapy planning, due to its superior uniformity and SNR. Incorporating 
this into the planning process could enhance the accuracy of tumor delineation and 
improve overall treatment outcomes. 
Dane et al (Dane et al 2024) conducted a study comparing the image quality of portal venous 
phase-derived VNC images obtained from PCCT and energy-integrating dual-energy computed 
tomography (EI-DECT). The study involved a cohort of 74 patients, where both qualitative and 
quantitative analyses were performed to assess the image quality differences between the two 
modalities. The findings demonstrated that PCCT VNC images consistently provided superior 
overall image quality, reduced noise, and better delineation of small structures compared to EI-
DECT. Additionally, PCCT exhibited improved CNR and SNR, especially in non-enhancing structures 
like fat, making it particularly advantageous in clinical scenarios where precise tissue 
characterization is critical. Notably, PCCT achieved these improvements with comparable 
radiation doses to EI-DECT, highlighting its potential for enhanced imaging without additional 
radiation risk. These findings underscore the significant advantages of PCCT over EI-DECT, 
particularly in achieving higher image quality with reduced artifacts, which is crucial for 
applications such as radiotherapy planning where precision is paramount. 
These findings align with those of Onishi et al (Onishi et al 2024), who emphasized that PCCT’s 
direct conversion of x rays into electrical signals enables it to generate VMIs with high CNR, 
improving the ability to visualize small or low-contrast lesions. Onishi et al. also noted that PCCT 
offers significant dose efficiency, with studies showing a dose reduction of approximately 32% in 
contrast-enhanced abdominal CT while maintaining image quality comparable to second-
generation dual-source CT (DSCT). These improvements, including reduced noise and better 
delineation of structures such as the renal pelvis, ureters, and mesenteric vessels, further 
underscore PCCT’s advantages in clinical applications requiring high precision, such as 
radiotherapy planning. Figure 5 presents a sample VNC image from PCCT and EICT.  
Similarly, Ren et al (Ren et al 2024) conducted a comparative study between PCCT and Dual-
Source DECT for multi-contrast imaging using iodine and gadolinium. The study found that DECT 
with greater spectral separation (such as 70/Sn150 kV and 80/Sn150 kV) outperformed PCCT in 
terms of reducing root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values for two-material decomposition. 
However, PCCT demonstrated better spatial resolution and noise reduction in certain imaging 
tasks, particularly for lower energy imaging and multi-contrast applications.

conventional DSCT in single-energy mode (B), performed on different days. The PCCT image, with a CTDIvol of 7.5 
mGy, demonstrates reduced noise, enhanced image quality, and improved visualization of small structures, such as 
the calcified stone in the common bile duct (arrows), compared to the conventional CT image, which had a CTDIvol 
of 11.9 mGy. This figure has been adapted from the work of Onishi et al (Onishi et al 2024) with permission from the

5. Currently Available PCCT Systems 
PCCT technology is undergoing rapid development and is being adopted by several prominent 
medical institutions worldwide. Leading centers in the United States, such as Duke University, 
Mayo Clinic, Stanford University, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are at the forefront 
of integrating PCCT into clinical practice and research. These institutions are exploring the 
benefits of PCCT's improved spatial resolution, spectral imaging capabilities, and radiation dose 
reduction. 
Several manufacturers have developed PCCT systems, with notable differences in detector 
technology, collimation, scan field of view, and energy thresholds. These manufacturers, including 
Siemens Healthcare, GE Healthcare, Philips Healthcare, Canon Medical Research, 
Samsung/NeuroLogica, and MARS Bioimaging, have each introduced systems with unique 
specifications tailored to different clinical applications. 
Below is a comparison of the currently available PCCT systems, detailing key characteristics such 
as detector type, collimation, scan field of view, and FDA clearance status. Table 2 summarizes 
the technology and FDA status of various PCCT systems.

These systems vary in terms of collimation, energy thresholds, and the regions of the body they 
are designed to image, offering different levels of resolution and image quality. The Siemens 
Naeotom Alpha, for instance, is one of the most advanced systems currently available, offering 
high-resolution imaging for full-body scans and is FDA-cleared for clinical use. Similarly, the 
Samsung/NeuroLogica OmniTom Elite PCD is FDA approved yet it is designed for head and neck 
imaging. 
The ongoing research and clinical trials conducted at leading institutions are expected to push the 
boundaries of PCCT's capabilities further, improving diagnostic accuracy and expanding its 
applications in fields such as oncology, cardiology, and neurology. With continuous technological 
advancements, PCCT systems are poised to become a cornerstone of advanced medical imaging 
in the coming years. 
6. PCCT in Radiotherapy 
The introduction of PCDs in CT imaging, leading to the development of PCCT, brings substantial 
improvements over conventional CT technologies. These advancements address the limitations 
of EIDs and offer enhanced imaging capabilities that are particularly beneficial for radiotherapy. 
In the context of radiotherapy, PCCT’s higher spatial and contrast resolution, along with the ability 
to perform multi-energy imaging, significantly enhances tumor delineation, treatment planning, 
and dose calculation. These improvements may translate into more precise targeting of cancerous 
tissues, better sparing of healthy tissues, and overall improved treatment outcomes. In the 
following sections, we will explore the specific advantages of PCCT in detail and how they 
integrate into the radiotherapy workflow to revolutionize cancer treatment. The overview of the 
radiotherapy workflow from patient setup and image segmentation to dose calculation and 
adaptive therapy, is described in Figure 6.  
 
Figure 6. Overview of the radiotherapy workflow. 
 
6.1 Patient Setup and Alignment 
Accurate patient alignment is critical in radiotherapy to ensure that the radiation dose is precisely 
targeted at the tumor while sparing healthy tissues. Misalignment can lead to suboptimal 
treatment outcomes, increased radiation exposure to normal tissues, and potential harm to the 
patient. Precise alignment ensures consistent treatment delivery across multiple sessions, 
enhancing the overall effectiveness and safety of radiotherapy. 
PCCT can enhance pre-treatment imaging for patient setup by providing high-resolution images 
with superior contrast. Although PCCTs are not currently integrated into treatment machines, 
their advanced detector technology allows for finer spatial resolution and better tissue 
differentiation in diagnostic settings. This high-resolution imaging aids in identifying anatomical 
landmarks more clearly during the simulation and treatment planning stages. For instance, small 
anatomical variations that could influence setup can be more accurately assessed during this pre-
treatment phase, ensuring these are considered for positioning protocols on the treatment 
machine. 
Recent developments, such as PCD-based multi-energy cone-beam CT (ME-CBCT), as explored by 
Hu et al. (Hu et al 2022b), show promise for improving on-board imaging in radiotherapy. ME-
CBCT combines the advantages of photon-counting technology with cone-beam CT, offering 
improved contrast resolution and potentially more accurate patient alignment during daily 
treatments. The multi-energy capability allows for better tissue characterization and reduced 
artifacts, addressing a key limitation of conventional CBCT systems. Integrating PCCT-based CBCT 
into treatment machines could significantly enhance patient setup accuracy by providing higher-
quality images during daily verification, aligning with the benefits seen in PCCT-based pre-
treatment imaging. 
Compared to conventional CT, PCCT offers advantages in pre-treatment imaging for radiotherapy 
planning. Conventional CT, though high in spatial resolution compared to modalities like MRI or 
PET, can sometimes struggle with specific small structures, such as the trabecular bone, 
particularly when contrast is low (Thomsen et al 2022). PCCT, with its higher resolution and 
improved CNR, allows for more precise identification of these structures, contributing to better 
pre-treatment planning and reducing the likelihood of setup errors when aligning the patient on 
the treatment machine. However, it’s important to note that on-board imaging systems, such as 
CBCT, are currently used for daily treatment verification and alignment, but future advancements 
like PCD-based ME-CBCT could further bridge this gap. 
PCCT's superior image quality and contrast resolution suggest that it could produce more detailed 
Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) compared to conventional CT, potentially aiding in 
more accurate localization during treatment planning. However, further research is needed to 
confirm the full impact of PCCT-generated DRRs on daily alignment with on-board x-ray systems. 
6.2 Image Segmentation (Target and OAR) 
Accurate segmentation of targets and OAR is essential for effective radiotherapy planning. 
Segmentation in radiotherapy involves delineating the boundaries of the tumor (target) and 
nearby critical structures (OARs) to ensure that the maximum dose of radiation is delivered to the 
tumor while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. Inaccurate segmentation can 
lead to suboptimal dose distribution, where parts of the tumor may receive insufficient radiation, 
or healthy tissues might be overexposed, leading to potential side effects and complications. 
Moreover, precise segmentation is critical in advanced radiotherapy techniques such as intensity-
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), where the 
radiation dose is shaped very closely to the target's contours. For example, studies involving liver 
have demonstrated that advanced imaging techniques such as DECT can significantly enhance 
segmentation accuracy (Chen et al 2020, Xu et al 2022). These techniques can then be adapted 
for use in radiotherapy, where precise tumor delineation is crucial to maximize therapeutic 
outcomes while minimizing exposure to healthy tissues in critical areas like the liver. Any errors 
in segmentation could lead to either an underdose in the tumor region, potentially compromising 
treatment effectiveness, or an overdose to surrounding healthy tissues, increasing the risk of 
radiation-induced toxicity. 
PCCT can play a pivotal role in improving segmentation accuracy due to its ability to provide high-
resolution, multi-energy images. Certain OARs, such as the brain and parotid glands, benefit from 
enhanced contrast and resolution, which aids in distinguishing sensitive structures (Shen et al 
2023, Yu et al 2023). These images offer better tissue contrast and delineation, allowing for more 
precise identification and segmentation of tumors and OARs. PCCT's improved tissue 
differentiation capability, particularly for small or complex structures, can help overcome 
challenges that arise during radiotherapy planning in anatomically complex regions. 
PCCT's multi-energy imaging capabilities enable the differentiation of tissues based on their 
specific energy-dependent attenuation properties. Aschenbrenner et al (Aschenbrenner et al 
2017) demonstrated the feasibility of ultra-low-dose (ULD) photon-counting imaging for lung 
tumor position estimation, showing high accuracy with as few as five photons per pixel, 
potentially reducing radiation exposure while maintaining accurate tumor tracking. Marcus et al 
(Marcus et al 2018) showed PCCT’s superiority over DECT in segmenting small renal stones, 
improving segmentation success (70% vs. 54.4%). Wang et al  (Wang et al 2019) demonstrated 
that monoenergetic images at 80 keV improved OAR delineation in head-and-neck radiotherapy. 
Karino et al (Karino et al 2020) found that VMIs at 63 keV significantly improved brain metastasis 
segmentation during radiosurgery. Paakkari et al (Paakkari et al 2021) showed PCCT’s capacity for 
energy-selective imaging, enhancing tissue segmentation with dual contrast agents in cartilage. 
Wang et al (Wang et al 2021b) developed a deep learning approach using DECT for automatic 
multi-organ segmentation in the head-and-neck, achieving a Dice similarity coefficient larger than 
0.8 for complex structures. 
These studies, summarized in Table 3, highlight the significant advantages of PCCT in improving 
segmentation accuracy across various clinical applications. By offering superior spatial resolution, 
enhanced contrast differentiation, and the ability to perform multi-energy imaging, PCCT allows 
for more precise identification and delineation of both tumors and OARs. This capability is 
particularly valuable in complex anatomical regions and in the context of advanced radiotherapy 
techniques, where accurate segmentation is crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes and 
minimizing the risk of radiation-induced side effects.

6.3 Radiation Dose Calculation 
Dose calculation in radiotherapy is a critical process that involves calculating the optimal radiation 
dose distribution to target the tumor while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. 
CT imaging is widely utilized in this process because it provides a detailed anatomical map of the 
patient’s body, enabling precise visualization of both the tumor and surrounding structures. One 
of the key advantages of using CT in radiotherapy dose calculation is the straightforward 
conversion of Hounsfield Units (HU) into electron density. This electron density information is 
crucial for modeling how radiation interacts with tissues, ensuring that the prescribed dose is 
delivered effectively to the tumor while sparing healthy tissues. 
One critical aspect of radiotherapy dose calculation is the accurate delineation of target volumes, 
which is often enhanced by the intravenous administration of iodine-based contrast agents during 
CT imaging. These agents improve the visibility of tumors, vessels nearby at-risk lymph nodes, 
and critical structures by increasing tissue attenuation, allowing for more precise targeting. 
However, the presence of iodine during imaging can lead to inaccuracies in dose calculations 
because the contrast agent is not present during the actual radiation delivery. This discrepancy 
can result in erroneous dose distributions, potentially compromising treatment effectiveness. To 
address this challenge, (Yamada et al 2014) proposed a novel framework that leverages dual-
energy virtual unenhanced CT to improve dose calculation accuracy in the presence of iodine 
contrast agents with photons. Their study demonstrated that by using DSCT with enhanced 
spectral separation, it is possible to generate virtual unenhanced images that closely match the 
attenuation values of true unenhanced images. The researchers found that dose distributions 
calculated from these virtual unenhanced images were nearly equivalent to those from true 
unenhanced images, with pass rates exceeding 90%. Conversely, dose calculations based on 
contrast-enhanced images alone showed significant deviations, with pass rates of only 50–60%, 
highlighting the potential errors in dose estimation due to the high attenuation properties of 
iodine.  
Yi-Qun et al (Yi-Qun et al 2016) investigated the use of DSCT with single-energy spectral imaging 
technology to further refine radiotherapy dose calculation for photons. Their study found that by 
processing images using single-energy spectrum imaging, it was possible to remove contrast 
agent artifacts, leading to more accurate dose calculations. For instance, when the iodine 
concentration was 30 g/100 mL, the deviation in dose measurement was significantly reduced 
from 5.95% in 80 kV images to 2.20% in spectral-fused images. This highlights the effectiveness 
of advanced spectral imaging techniques in enhancing the accuracy of radiotherapy planning, 
particularly when contrast agents are involved. 
Another critical aspect of dose calculation is the accurate estimation of relative electron densities 
ρe and Z_eff of tissues, which directly impact dose calculation accuracy, especially in proton 
therapy. Traditional methods involve CT scanning of tissue substitute materials (TSMs) to create 
HU– ρe calibration curves, but these can introduce errors due to variations in tissue composition 
and x-ray beam spectra. In their study, (Tahmasebi Birgani et al 2018) proposed a more accurate 
approach by constructing an in-house phantom and applying dual-energy algorithms to scans at 
different kVp settings. Their methodology improved the differentiation of tissues with similar 
attenuation coefficients but different ρe and Z_eff, leading to more precise characterization. The 
study demonstrated that using dual-energy algorithms combined with stoichiometric calibration 
reduced errors in ρe calculation compared to traditional methods. For instance, the mean and 
standard deviation of the absolute difference in ρe were significantly reduced when using 80–140 
kVp and 100–140 kVp scans, compared to standard 120 kVp scans. Furthermore, a 
parametrization algorithm decreased the Z_eff discrepancy for tissues like the thyroid, achieving 
a residual error as low as 0.18 units. This low value represents the difference between the 
calculated Z_eff and the true value, providing context for the accuracy of the estimation. 
McCollough et al (McCollough et al 2023) highlight, the dependence of CT numbers on x-ray beam 
spectra can limit the quantitative accuracy and standardization of these measurements, posing 
challenges in achieving robust and consistent applications in radiotherapy. PCCT technology 
addresses these limitations by offering inherent multi-energy capabilities, expanding material 
decomposition options, and improving spatial resolution and geometric quantification (Meloni et 
al 2023). This makes PCCT a superior choice for dose calculation, as it allows for more precise and 
standardized computation. 
These studies underscore the importance of incorporating advanced imaging technologies like 
PCCT into radiotherapy dose calculation, particularly for disease sites where precise 
differentiation is crucial. By improving the accuracy of dose calculations and reducing artifacts, 
these technologies ensure more precise targeting of the tumor involving complex anatomy or the 
use of intravenous contrast agents, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. 
6.3.1 Proton Stopping Power Ratio 
One of the key advantages of PCCT in radiotherapy dose calculation is its ability to provide more 
accurate proton stopping power ratio (SPR) estimates. Accurate SPR values are essential for 
precise proton dose calculations. In conventional EICT, SPR is often estimated indirectly through 
conversion of HUs, which can introduce errors due to tissue inhomogeneities and the limitations 
of the conversion algorithm. PCCT, with its multi-energy imaging capability, allows for direct and 
more accurate measurement of SPR by leveraging its ability to differentiate between different 
tissue types based on their energy-dependent attenuation properties. 
The improved accuracy of SPR estimates provided by PCCT directly impacts the precision of dose 
calculations in proton therapy. Accurate dose calculations ensure that the prescribed dose is 
delivered precisely to the tumor, maximizing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing exposure to 
healthy tissues. By reducing uncertainties in SPR estimates, PCCT contributes to more reliable and 
effective treatment plans, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. 
Over the years, various advanced techniques have been explored to improve SPR estimation, 
moving beyond the traditional SECT methods. These approaches include the use of DECT, MECT, 
and PCCT. Each method offers unique advantages, contributing to a more precise determination 
of SPR, which directly influences the accuracy of dose distribution in radiotherapy. 
Studies such as Lalonde et al  (Lalonde et al 2017) introduced Bayesian Eigen tissue 
decomposition for MECT, reducing SPR errors. Möhler et al  (Möhler et al 2017) focused on DECT 
electron density, providing high accuracy for SPR estimations. Mei et al (Mei et al 2018) and Xie 
et al (Xie et al 2018) both validated dual-layer CT and stoichiometric DECT for improved SPR 
prediction. Taasti et al (Taasti et al 2018) and Saito (Saito 2019)  further emphasized PCCT's 
superior accuracy in noise robustness and tissue characterization. 
Simard et al  (Simard et al 2019, 2020) adapted PCCT for Bayesian decomposition, achieving 
reduced RMS errors. Chang et al. (2022) introduced deep learning frameworks for SPR prediction 
with greater accuracy. Faller et al (Faller et al 2020) and Longarino et al (Longarino et al 2022a, 
2022b) explored DLCT's clinical utility in particle therapy, reporting improvements in proton 
therapy precision by reducing beam range uncertainties. 
Li et al (Li et al 2020) assessed MECT for stenosis quantification, demonstrating that it reduced 
partial volume and blooming effects, supporting more reliable SPR estimation in clinical practice. 
Nasmark and Andersson (Näsmark and Andersson 2021) introduced dual-energy VMIs, showing 
improved SPR accuracy in complex tissue environments, while Wang et al (Wang et al 2021a) 
developed a noise-robust learning method for accurate SPR predictions. Meng et al  (Meng et al 
2022) demonstrated the utility of DECT combined with metal artifact reduction (MAR) for SPR 
accuracy, particularly in challenging conditions involving metal artifacts. 
Hu et al (Hu et al 2022a) validated PCCT for SPR using VMIs, achieving enhanced SPR accuracy for 
dose calculations. Zhu et al (Zhu et al 2023) focused on spectral CT for SPR prediction, showing 
dose deviations reduced by 2.57% in lung tumors. Longarino et al (Longarino et al 2023) also 
emphasized better SPR predictions with DLCT in patients with dental materials, improving clinical 
accuracy in particle therapy. Finally, Yang et al (Yang et al 2023) reviewed various DECT and MECT 
methods for SPR, highlighting their strengths for clinical proton therapy applications, while 
Zimmerman et al (Zimmerman et al 2023) and Han et al (Han et al 2024) explored algorithms and 
spectral separation for enhanced SPR in pediatric proton therapy cases. Fogazzi et al (Fogazzi et 
al 2024) compared DECT, PCCT, and proton CT (pCT), with PCCT showing superior image quality 
while pCT excelled in SPR accuracy. 
Table 4 summarizes key studies that have investigated various advanced CT methods, including 
DECT, MECT, and PCCT, for improving SPR estimation. These studies highlight the advancements 
in SPR accuracy achieved through different techniques and their potential clinical applications in 
proton therapy.

6.4 Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) 
Metal artifacts present a significant challenge in diagnostic imaging, as they can obscure critical 
anatomical structures and distort surrounding tissue visualization. These artifacts are typically 
caused by high-density materials such as dental fillings, orthopedic implants, and surgical clips, 
which interfere with x-ray beams and result in streaks or dark shadows on conventional EICT 
images. This degradation in image quality can hinder accurate diagnostic interpretation and pose 
challenges for various clinical applications, including radiotherapy, surgical planning, and 
diagnostic evaluations. 
 PCCT offers advanced techniques for MAR, leveraging its multi-energy imaging capabilities to 
differentiate between high-density metals and surrounding tissues. By counting individual 
photons and sorting them into specific energy bins, PCCT can mitigate the effects of metal 
artifacts more effectively than conventional EICT, thereby reducing metal artifacts. This 
technology is particularly valuable in cases where metal implants are present, such as hip 
replacements, dental work, or prosthetics, as it reduces blooming artifacts and distortion caused 
by high-density materials. As a result, PCCT enables clinicians to visualize and analyze tissues and 
structures more accurately, even in challenging environments with metallic elements (Selles et al 
2024, O’Connell et al 2024). 
Several studies have highlighted the benefits of PCCT in reducing metal artifacts, summarized in 
Table 5. For example, Brook et al (Brook et al 2012) evaluated the use of spectral CT with MAR 
software for reducing artifacts associated with gold fiducial seeds, finding that MAR 
reconstruction significantly improved image quality near the seeds. This improvement is 
particularly relevant for patients with both gold markers and I-125 seeds in LDR prostate 
brachytherapy, where it can be difficult to distinguish larger gold markers from clustered I-125 
seeds. PCCT may help address this challenge by providing clearer differentiation between 
different materials. 
Li et al (Li et al 2020) demonstrated that MECT reduces partial volume and blooming effects, 
allowing for more accurate measurements, even in areas with calcifications or other dense 
materials. Allphin et al (Allphin et al 2023) explored the benefits of combining different PCDs in a 
micro-CT system, showing improved spectral performance and significantly reduced artifacts. 
Stein et al (Stein et al 2023) systematically evaluated the impact of PCCT on imaging small vessel 
stents, confirming superior image quality and reduced artifacts compared to conventional EICTs. 
The advancements in MAR techniques provided by PCCT may offer significant clinical benefits, 
not only in radiotherapy but also across other fields such as diagnostic radiology, interventional 
procedures, and post-surgical follow-up. With its ability to mitigate the impact of metal artifacts, 
PCCT may enhance the accuracy and reliability of imaging, improving patient outcomes and 
supporting more effective clinical decision-making. Even in non-patient scenarios, like QA 
equipment and phantom imaging, metal artifacts, such as distorted ball bearings and streaks in 
detector arrays, present challenges. PCCT's potential for reducing metal artifacts may provide 
notable improvements in quality assurance processes.

6.5 Tumor Response Evaluation/Outcome Modeling 
Monitoring tumor response during and after radiotherapy is a vital aspect of evaluating treatment 
efficacy and optimizing patient care. Accurate assessment of how a tumor responds to radiation 
not only provides insights into the effectiveness of the therapy but also guides potential 
modifications to the treatment plan. This ongoing evaluation is crucial for ensuring that the tumor 
is being targeted effectively while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. 
 PCCT offers significant advancements in tumor response evaluation due to its ability to produce 
high-resolution, multi-energy images. These images provide detailed insights into tumor 
morphology, allowing clinicians to track changes in tumor size, shape, and density over time. The 
multi-energy capabilities of PCCT may also enable the differentiation of various tissue types based 
on their specific attenuation properties, making it easier to distinguish between viable tumor 
tissue and areas of necrosis or fibrosis that may occur as a result of treatment. 
Moreover, PCCT's ability to generate quantitative imaging data plays a crucial role in outcome 
modeling in radiotherapy. By analyzing the detailed imaging features provided by PCCT, clinicians 
can develop predictive models that correlate specific imaging biomarkers with treatment 
outcomes. For example, changes in tumor volume, density, and contrast enhancement patterns 
observed through PCCT can be used to predict the likelihood of treatment success or the potential 
for tumor recurrence. 
This quantitative approach enables personalized treatment planning, where adjustments to the 
radiation dose, treatment duration, or even the introduction of additional therapies can be made 
based on the observed tumor response. Such data-driven decisions can significantly improve 
patient outcomes by ensuring that the treatment remains effective throughout its course and by 
allowing for timely interventions when necessary. 
Furthermore, the ability of PCCT to provide longitudinal imaging data with minimal artifacts and 
high contrast resolution enhances the precision of tumor response evaluation. This is particularly 
important in ART, where real-time adjustments to the treatment plan are made based on changes 
in tumor morphology. The use of PCCT in this context not only enhances the accuracy of tumor 
response assessment but also supports the implementation of more dynamic and responsive 
treatment strategies. 
Several studies have demonstrated the utility of advanced CT technologies like spectral CT and 
PCCT in evaluating tumor response. Hu et al (Hu et al 2014) explored spectral CT's ability to 
monitor treatment response in pancreatic carcinoma xenografts, correlating reduced iodine 
concentration with treatment efficacy. Aoki et al (Aoki et al 2016) found that lower iodine density 
in lung tumors, as evaluated by DECT, predicted worse local control post-SBRT. Similarly, Al-Najami 
et al (Al-Najami et al 2017) and Lapointe et al (Lapointe et al 2017) demonstrated DECT's utility 
in quantifying tumor regression and lung function preservation in rectal and lung cancers, 
respectively. 
Further extending the potential of PCCT, Nicol et al (Nicol et al 2019) and Fehrenbach et al 
(Fehrenbach et al 2019) highlighted its applications in cardiovascular imaging and non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), suggesting these techniques could be applied similarly in oncology for more 
accurate response evaluations. Liao et al (Liao et al 2022) and Inoue et al (Inoue et al 2022) 
explored spectral CT's role in predicting treatment responses in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 
lung disease, while Salas-Ramirez et al (Salas-Ramirez et al 2022) and Fu et al (Fu et al 2023)  
showcased DECT's use in bone marrow quantification and osteosarcoma imaging. 
In other areas, Tong et al (Tong et al 2024)  developed a nomogram combining spectral CT data 
with clinical characteristics to predict lymphovascular invasion in gastric cancer, while Li et al (Li 
et al 2024b) assessed DECT parameters for predicting radiotherapy sensitivity in nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma. Finally, Bellin et al (Bellin et al 2024) reviewed DECT’s potential in improving 
diagnostic accuracy for renal cell carcinoma, suggesting that similar benefits may extend to tumor 
response assessments in radiotherapy. These advancements could translate to similar benefits in 
evaluating tumor response in radiotherapy, showcasing the broad applicability of these imaging 
technologies. 
Table 6 summarizes key studies that investigate the use of spectral CT and PCCT for tumor 
response evaluation across various cancer types. These studies demonstrate the ability of 
advanced CT technologies to monitor vascular changes, predict tumor progression, and assess 
treatment outcomes more accurately, supporting personalized treatment strategies in 
radiotherapy and oncology.

6.6 Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART) 
Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) involves adjusting the treatment plan in real-time or offline between 
fractions   based on changes in patient anatomy or tumor size during treatment. PCCT’s high-
resolution, multi-energy imaging capabilities make it ideal for both approaches by providing 
detailed images that help monitor anatomical changes, ensuring precise treatment adjustments. 
This real-time adaptability allows the radiation dose to remain optimally targeted to the tumor, 
enhancing both treatment efficacy and patient safety. 
Deformable registration plays a key role in ART, as it aligns images taken at different times to track 
anatomical changes. PCCT’s superior imaging quality enhances the accuracy of deformable 
registration, ensuring that shifts in patient anatomy are precisely tracked. Accurate registration is 
critical for delivering the correct dose to the tumor while minimizing radiation exposure to 
surrounding healthy tissues, ultimately improving ART's effectiveness. 
Hu et al (Hu et al 2022b) developed a PCD-based ME-CBCT system on a preclinical small animal 
irradiator to enhance the accuracy of material differentiation and dose calculation, comparing its 
performance to conventional flat-panel detector (FPD)-based CBCT. The study involved mounting 
a PCD onto an existing irradiator platform   and utilizing a 100 kVp x-ray beam with three optimized 
energy thresholds for SNRs. The results demonstrated that using PCD-based ME-CBCT 
significantly improved dose calculation accuracy, reducing the mean relative error in bone regions 
from 49.5% to 16.4% and in soft tissue regions from 7.5% to 6.9%. While this study focused on a 
preclinical irradiator platform, PCCT could offer similar benefits in offline ART, where treatment 
adaptations occur between fractions. Additionally, PCCT's advanced imaging may also be 
applicable to lower-energy procedures, such as electronic brachytherapy (50 kVp), which is used 
in spine intraoperative RT. This would allow for better treatment precision in such specialized 
clinical applications, further expanding PCCT's utility in adaptive radiotherapy scenarios. 
 
7. Radiomics and Deep Learning Using PCCT 
Radiomics and deep learning are two rapidly evolving fields in medical imaging, offering powerful 
tools for improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Radiomics involves 
extracting large numbers of quantitative features from medical images (Gillies et al 2016), which 
can then be used for predictive modeling and personalized treatment planning. Deep learning, 
on the other hand, leverages artificial intelligence to automate and enhance the interpretation 
of complex imaging data (LeCun et al 2015). PCCT serves as an ideal platform for both 
technologies due to its ability to capture high-resolution, multi-energy images, providing a wealth 
of data for feature extraction and deep learning analysis. 
7.1 Radiomics in PCCT 
Radiomics involves the extraction of a vast array of quantitative features from medical images, 
which can be used to build predictive models that assist in patient outcome predictions. Yang et 
al (Yang et al 2018) demonstrated that DECT-derived features like iodine concentration could 
predict therapeutic outcomes in laryngeal cancers. Allphin et al (Allphin et al 2022) found that 
PCCT-derived radiomics features offered higher accuracy for tumor stratification than EID. Ayx et 
al (Ayx et al 2022) compared PCCT and EICT in myocardial imaging, observing significant 
differences in higher-order texture features due to PCCT's enhanced resolution. Ter Maat et al 
(Ter Maat et al 2023) suggested that PCCT’s spectral data could enhance radiomics models in 
personalized treatment strategies. 
7.2 Deep Learning in PCCT 
PCCT’s multi-energy imaging capabilities provide an ideal dataset for training deep learning 
algorithms, offering improved accuracy in image segmentation, diagnosis, and treatment 
planning. Wen et al (Wen et al 2022) demonstrated DL’s potential in differentiating central lung 
cancer from atelectasis, significantly improving tumor delineation. Similarly, Jacobsen et al 
(Jacobsen et al 2020) and Van Der Werf et al (Van Der Werf et al 2022) highlighted the 
quantitative benefits of PCCT for various applications, stressing the need for advanced DL models. 
Wang et al (Wang et al 2023) introduced DL models with PCCT for predicting temperature 
changes during ablation, enhancing procedural accuracy. Ge et al (Ge et al 2024) and Sun et al 
(Sun et al 2024) further integrated PCCT-derived features into DL models, improving predictive 
accuracy for conditions such as LVI in gastric cancer and colorectal adenocarcinoma staging. Sidky 
and Pan (Sidky and Pan 2024) showcased DL’s superiority in spectral CT image reconstruction, 
while Alves et al  (Alves et al 2024) emphasized PCCT’s advantages over EICT for feature 
extraction and deep learning applications. 
Table 7 summarizes key studies that explore the intersection of PCCT with radiomics and deep 
learning, highlighting the various clinical applications and the potential benefits these 
technologies offer in improving tumor assessment and treatment outcomes. 
The integration of radiomics and deep learning with PCCT holds great promise for advancing the 
field of radiotherapy. By leveraging PCCT’s spectral imaging capabilities, these technologies 
enable more accurate diagnosis, improved treatment planning, and better patient outcomes. As 
studies continue to demonstrate the advantages of PCCT over conventional CT, particularly in 
personalized medicine, the future of radiomics and deep learning in radiotherapy looks bright.

8. Internal Radiotherapy: Brachytherapy and Radiopharmaceutical Therapy (RPT) 
Internal radiotherapy, including brachytherapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT), relies on 
the precise delivery of radiation to tumors while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy 
tissues. PCCT has the potential to revolutionize these therapies by providing high-resolution, 
multi-energy images that enhance both dosimetry calculations and real-time treatment 
monitoring. 
In brachytherapy, both LDR and high-dose-rate (HDR) methods involve implanting radioactive 
sources directly into or near the tumor for targeted radiation delivery. However, metal artifacts 
from both the radioactive seeds in LDR and metal applicators used in HDR brachytherapy can 
obscure critical anatomical details, complicating dosimetry and treatment planning. PCCT could 
address these challenges by providing high-resolution, artifact-reduced images, improving 
visualization and accuracy for precise dose delivery in internal radiotherapy. Current research 
highlights the potential of PCCT to address these challenges by providing clearer, artifact-free 
images. Hu et al (Hu et al 2014) demonstrated that spectral CT could effectively track therapeutic 
response to 125I interstitial brachytherapy in a pancreatic carcinoma model showing a significant 
correlation between iodine concentration and microvessel density in treated tumors. 
Additionally, Yang et al (Yang et al 2015) investigated the use of spectral CT combined with MAR 
software (MARS) to optimize imaging quality around 125I seeds used in liver brachytherapy. Their 
findings indicated that using monochromatic images at 75 keV, with the aid of MARS, substantially 
reduced artifacts, allowing for better tumor visibility and accurate treatment evaluation 
supporting the idea that PCCT could further enhance image quality in brachytherapy by offering 
even higher resolution and better metal artifact reduction. 
Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT), which involves the administration of radioactive substances 
to target tumors, also benefits from the capabilities of PCCT. Accurate tracking and quantification 
of radiopharmaceutical uptake in both the tumor and surrounding tissues are essential for 
effective treatment planning and monitoring. The work of Liu et al (Liu et al 2016) on gemstone 
spectral imaging (GSI) and metal artifact reduction demonstrated that GSI could effectively reduce 
artifacts from 125I seeds, improving the CNR and visibility of adjacent tissues, indicates that PCCT’s 
multi-energy imaging capabilities could further improve the precision of dosimetry calculations 
and enhance the effectiveness of RPT. 
The future of internal radiotherapy lies in personalized treatment approaches, and PCCT holds 
the key to enabling such precision. By providing clearer, artifact-free images and allowing for more 
accurate tracking of radioactive seeds and radiopharmaceuticals, PCCT can enhance dosimetry 
and treatment monitoring. This would lead to highly individualized treatment plans that adjust 
dynamically to the patient’s specific anatomy and response to therapy, ultimately improving 
treatment outcomes and minimizing complications. 
Table 8 summarizes key studies that have investigated the impact of spectral CT and related 
technologies on improving image quality and artifact reduction in internal radiotherapy, 
demonstrating the potential application of PCCT in this domain.

9. CT Dose Reduction 
One of the most notable advantages of PCCT over conventional EICT is its potential for significant 
radiation dose reduction, which is particularly relevant in RT settings. In treatments such as 
proton therapy, frequent scans are necessary to verify patient setup or adapt to anatomical 
changes. PCCT’s lower-dose imaging capability, while maintaining or enhancing image quality, 
supports these needs without adding significant radiation burden. This aligns with the growing 
efforts in clinical care to reduce exposure, particularly as CT scan utilization has dramatically 
increased, where approximately 80 million scans are performed annually in the United States, 
(Patel et al 2017). Despite advances in dose-reduction techniques, such as iterative 
reconstruction, automatic exposure control, and electrocardiography-triggered imaging, 
radiation exposure remains a significant concern. These techniques, while effective, have not fully 
addressed the cumulative risk associated with repeated imaging, particularly in vulnerable 
populations such as pediatric and oncology patients. 
PCCT addresses these concerns by minimizing electronic noise and enabling x-ray photon energy 
weighting. This allows for reduced image noise at the same x-ray exposure compared to 
conventional CT scanners, leading to an overall reduction in radiation dose. Krauss et al (Krauss 
et al 2015)  highlighted tin filtration’s ability to improve dose efficiency in DECT, while Zeng et al 
(Zeng et al 2016) demonstrated advanced denoising filters reducing noise and allowing dose 
reductions. Gao et al (Gao et al 2016) showed an 11% radiation dose reduction in CT angiography 
with PCCT, while Symons et al (Symons et al 2017a, 2017b, 2017c) presented up to 10% dose 
savings in lung cancer screening and low-dose chest CT, with reduced noise and improved image 
quality. 
Apfaltrer et al (Apfaltrer et al 2020) achieved a 25% dose reduction in urolithiasis imaging, with 
Naveed et al (Naveed et al 2021) showing PCCT could differentiate blood from contrast in 
embolization, reducing the need for follow-up imaging. Graafen et al (Graafen et al 2022) and 
Woeltjen et al (Woeltjen et al 2022) confirmed significant dose reductions in lung imaging, with 
Graafen showing a 50% reduction. Jungblut et al (Jungblut et al 2022) reported a 66% dose 
reduction for systemic sclerosis imaging, while Donuru et al (Donuru et al 2023) saw a nearly 40% 
lower dose in non-contrast chest CT. Dirrichs et al (Dirrichs et al 2023) highlighted superior 
pediatric cardiovascular imaging at comparable doses, and Dettmer et al (Dettmer et al 2024) 
achieved a chest CT dose similar to a chest x-ray with PCCT. 
Milos et al (Milos et al 2024) reported a tenfold reduction in radiation dose for lung transplant 
patients, maintaining diagnostic accuracy for lung abnormalities, while Huflage et al (Huflage et 
al 2024) showed ultra-high-resolution PCCT maintained superior image quality at no dose 
disadvantage, benefiting repeated scans for high-risk patients. 
Table 9 summarizes several studies comparing the radiation dose and image quality between 
PCCT and conventional EICT. Taken together, these findings consistently highlight PCCT's ability to 
reduce radiation doses by 30% to 60%, depending on the clinical application, while maintaining 
or even enhancing image quality. This makes PCCT a highly promising tool for improving patient 
safety across a wide range of imaging tasks, particularly in fields like oncology, pediatrics, and 
long-term follow-up scenarios where dose reduction is paramount.

10.  Discussion 
PCCT represents a major advancement in imaging technology, offering significant advantages over 
traditional EID systems. PCCT’s ability to count individual photons and classify them by energy 
vastly improves spatial and contrast resolution, reduces radiation dose, and enables superior 
spectral imaging. These enhancements position PCCT as a transformative tool across various 
clinical applications, including radiotherapy, internal radiotherapy such as brachytherapy and RPT, 
and deep learning-based image analysis. Moreover, PCCT’s advanced multi-energy capabilities 
and MAR techniques contribute to improved image clarity, particularly in complex anatomical 
regions with metal implants, making it an invaluable asset in medical imaging. 
In the context of radiotherapy, PCCT offers numerous benefits by enhancing tumor targeting and 
treatment planning. Its ability to produce high-resolution, multi-energy images improves 
segmentation accuracy for both tumors and OARs, leading to more precise dose calculations and 
reduced radiation exposure to healthy tissues, ultimately improving treatment outcomes. PCCT 
also offers more precise proton SPR estimations, which are critical for proton therapy. By reducing 
uncertainties in SPR estimates, PCCT ensures that the prescribed dose is delivered accurately, 
minimizing the risk of underdosing or overdosing the tumor. 
PCCT also has the potential to revolutionize internal radiotherapy modalities like brachytherapy 
and RPT. In brachytherapy, PCCT’s ability to reduce metal artifacts enhances visibility around 
implanted radioactive seeds, allowing for more accurate treatment planning. Similarly, in RPT, 
PCCT improves the tracking and quantification of radiopharmaceuticals, enabling more precise 
dosimetry calculations. These enhancements ensure that the correct radiation dose is delivered 
to the tumor while minimizing exposure to healthy tissues, thereby improving the overall 
effectiveness of internal radiotherapy. 
The evolving field of ART stands to benefit greatly from PCCT’s superior imaging capabilities. 
PCCT’s high-resolution images are essential for detecting small anatomical changes during 
treatment, which is critical for accurate deformable registration and real-time treatment 
adjustments. This level of precision ensures that the radiation dose remains optimally targeted at 
the tumor, enhancing the overall effectiveness of ART and contributing to better patient 
outcomes. 
Bader et al (Bader et al 2020) demonstrated the feasibility of designing a photon-counting cone-
beam CT (PCCBCT) system for improved imaging quality using a small detector area. Their 
benchtop system used step-and-shoot acquisition with a user-friendly control interface and 
iterative optimization for better geometrical parameter estimation. The success of this lab-based 
system underscores the significant potential of PCCT in clinical applications where higher spatial 
resolution and enhanced spectral imaging are crucial. Future applications could include 
leveraging this system design to optimize ART workflows, where precise imaging for deformable 
registration and motion tracking is essential for delivering accurate doses. 
As shown in Figure 1 and supported by the results discussed, limited studies exist regarding the 
direct application of PCCT in radiotherapy. To provide a more comprehensive review, we 
considered studies related to spectral CTs such as DECT, DLCT, and MECT. The comparisons and 
findings in Sections 3 and 4 demonstrate the clear advantage PCCT holds over these spectral CT 
methods in terms of spatial resolution, contrast resolution, and overall imaging quality. If the 
radiotherapy workflow can benefit from the improvements offered by spectral CTs, it will most 
certainly improve by utilizing PCCT, as PCCT provides superior results.  
Furthermore, the distribution of studies involving PCCT, and other CT types (Table 10) discussed 
in this paper illustrates the current focus areas of research in RT with PCCT, highlighting the need 
for more in-depth investigation in critical areas such as image segmentation, proton SPR 
estimation, and tumor response assessment. These studies reveal that while PCCT is advancing 
in specific areas like dose reduction, more comprehensive reviews and applications, particularly 
in proton SPR estimation, are present in studies focusing on other CT modalities.

Radiomics and deep learning are two rapidly growing fields that could further capitalize on PCCT’s 
advanced imaging capabilities. Radiomics extracts quantitative imaging features to develop 
predictive models for treatment outcomes, while deep learning algorithms can automate image 
segmentation and tumor response evaluation. PCCT’s ability to capture multi-energy, high-
resolution images provides a wealth of data for radiomics and deep learning models, enhancing 
their predictive power and enabling more personalized treatment planning. Compared to 
conventional CT, PCCT-based radiomic features demonstrate greater accuracy in tumor 
stratification and treatment response evaluation, while deep learning models trained on PCCT 
data improve tumor delineation and segmentation for radiotherapy. 
Quantitative imaging, facilitated by PCCT, plays a pivotal role in evaluating tumor response and 
guiding adaptive treatment strategies in radiotherapy. By providing detailed data on tumor 
morphology, density, and perfusion, PCCT enables clinicians to monitor tumor response during 
and after treatment. Predictive models built from PCCT-derived biomarkers can guide dose 
escalation or de-escalation strategies, optimizing treatment efficacy while minimizing the risk of 
overtreatment or undertreatment. 
One of PCCT’s most notable advantages is its ability to reduce radiation dose by 30-60%, while 
maintaining or even improving image quality. This dose reduction is particularly valuable in 
radiotherapy, where repeated imaging is required for treatment monitoring. Studies such as those 
by Donuru et al (Donuru et al 2023) and Jungblut et al (Jungblut et al 2022) have consistently 
shown that PCCT achieves significant dose reductions without compromising diagnostic accuracy.  
One significant limitation remains the limited availability of clinical trials that assess its efficacy in 
radiotherapy settings. While many studies have explored PCCT’s advantages in diagnostic 
imaging, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish its full impact in RT. 
Increased clinical trial data is essential to validate the safety, efficacy, and clinical workflow 
integration of PCCT in radiotherapy. As we gain more insights from these trials, we can better 
define its role in treatment protocols, ensuring its broader adoption and optimizing patient 
outcomes. 
However, despite its remarkable benefits, PCCT faces certain limitations that hinder its broader 
clinical adoption. The higher cost of PCCT systems, driven by the sophisticated detector materials 
like cadmium telluride (CdTe) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT), poses a significant challenge. 
Many medical institutions, particularly in low-resource settings, struggle to afford this technology, 
limiting its global accessibility. Furthermore, while PCCT is being integrated into radiology, many 
of its software packages are not fully optimized for radiotherapy, lacking essential tools like 
motion tracking, quality assurance (QA), and image guidance. This gap prevents radiotherapy 
departments from utilizing PCCT to its full potential. 
To address these limitations, innovative solutions are necessary. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a 
promising approach to reducing costs and increasing global accessibility. AI algorithms, including 
Diffusion models, CycleGANs, and other generative models, could be trained to synthesize PCCT 
images from conventional EICT data. This would reduce reliance on expensive PCDs by providing 
institutions with EICT systems the ability to access PCCT-quality images. Additionally, AI could 
streamline processes like image registration, dose recalculation, and segmentation, reducing 
operational costs and improving efficiency in radiotherapy departments. AI-driven adaptive 
radiotherapy, utilizing real-time PCCT images, could further enhance treatment precision by 
adjusting radiation dose based on changes in patient anatomy. 
A critical factor in making PCCT more practical for radiotherapy is the development of specialized 
software by vendors. Currently, most PCCT software is designed for radiology, leaving radiation 
oncology departments without essential tools for QA, motion tracking, and image guidance. 
Vendors must collaborate with radiation oncology departments to create software that fully 
integrates PCCT’s advanced features, including multi-energy image reconstruction, metal artifact 
reduction, and advanced dose calculation algorithms. These tools would enhance the precision 
of radiotherapy treatments, enabling real-time adjustments and improving patient outcomes. 
Exploring alternative detector technologies could also help reduce the cost of PCCT systems. 
Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based detectors, as explored by (van der Sar et al 2021) offer a 
promising alternative to CdTe and CZT detectors. These detectors can achieve similar energy 
resolution and rate capability while potentially reducing system costs, making PCCT more 
accessible for radiotherapy applications. 
Monte Carlo simulations offer another solution for optimizing PCCT-based radiotherapy 
protocols. As discussed by Wang et al (Wang et al 2020, 2024) and Li et al (Li et al 2024a), these 
simulations provide detailed modeling of photon transport and tissue interactions, which can be 
used to validate new PCCT protocols before clinical implementation. Monte Carlo studies play a 
crucial role in developing PCCT for complex treatment scenarios like proton therapy, where 
accurate dose calculations are critical. 
In pediatric radiotherapy, where precise dose calculations are vital, PCCT’s ability to improve 
imaging accuracy is particularly valuable. Proton therapy is increasingly recommended for 
pediatric patients due to its reduced radiation exposure to healthy tissues. PCCT’s ability to 
accurately differentiate tissue types and calculate proton stopping power ratios can help minimize 
dose uncertainties, ensuring safer and more effective treatments for children. 
In conclusion, PCCT offers numerous advantages over conventional EICT systems, but addressing 
its limitations is essential for broader adoption in radiotherapy. AI-driven solutions, specialized 
software development, alternative detector technologies, and Monte Carlo simulations all have 
the potential to make PCCT a more accessible and integrated tool in cancer treatment. PCCT’s 
ability to revolutionize radiotherapy—from enhancing tumor targeting to enabling adaptive 
treatments—positions it as a key technology in the future of cancer diagnosis and treatment.
