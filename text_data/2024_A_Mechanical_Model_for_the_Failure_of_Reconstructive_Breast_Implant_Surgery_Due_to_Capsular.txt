Abstract
Capsular contracture is a pathological response to implant-based reconstructive breast surgery, where the “cap-
sule” (tissue surrounding an implant) painfully thickens, contracts and deforms. It is known to affect breast-
cancer survivors at higher rates than healthy women opting for cosmetic cosmetic breast augmentation with
implants. We model the early stages of capsular contracture based on stress-dependent recruitment of contrac-
tile and mechanosensitive cells to the implant site. We derive a one-dimensional continuum spatial model for
the spatio-temporal evolution of cells and collagen densities away from the implant surface. Various mechanistic
assumptions are investigated for linear versus saturating mechanical cell responses and cell traction forces. Our
results point to specific risk factors for capsular contracture, and indicate how physiological parameters, as well
as initial states (such as inflammation after surgery) contribute to patient susceptibility.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a common life-threatening disease that necessitates surgery with the possible addition of radia-
tion and chemotherapy. Following surgical removal of cancerous tissue with a mastectomy, breast reconstruction
is offered to restore a sense of normalcy and improve quality of life in survivorship. In implant-based breast
reconstruction, a prosthetic implant is used to restore the breast mound. In normal healing, new scar tissue
defined as the “capsule” forms around the implant surface, consisting of cells and extracellular matrix com-
ponents A pathological result, capsular contracture (CC) may develop in 15-40% of cases with a higher rate
of occurrence for breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy [1]. The pathological capsule contracts and
exerts pressure on the implant, within the span of months to years, resulting in chronic pain and deformity.
CC usually mandates further surgery to remove the implant, a highly undesirable outcome. Our aim is to
understand the causes and risk factors leading to this pathology.
Normal healing involves a cascade of cell recruitment, chemical signaling, cell contraction, remodeling of the
extracellular matrix, and eventual resolution of the inflammatory response. There are reasons to believe that
in CC, pathological tissue capsules develop as a result of abnormal healing with run-away or abnormal immune
responses or abnormal fibrosis [2]. Our purpose here is to explore the cellular-level root causes, with particular
emphasis on cell mechanosensitivity.
The precise mechanism underlying the development of capsular contracture remains elusive, but a few key
observations have been made. First, the extent of the initial immune response varies from patient to patient,
meaning that different surgical practices and clinical environment may lead to different outcomes. Distinct
outcomes can also occur in the same patient (e.g., left vs right breast). Second, the time span of CC development
ranges from months to years after a breast implant surgery, with many patients only developing symptoms years
later. It has been suggested that this delayed response could result from sudden immune insults, such as bacterial
infection [3]; micro-tears of the implant due rupture [4]; or even a COVID-19 vaccination [5], leading to the
activation of immune cells in the proximity to the implant.
It is challenging to study CC etiology, as histological and mechanical data are typically only collected when
1

pathological capsules are extracted in follow-up surgery. Clinical experiments are costly and can be difficult
to conduct, as monitoring the early stages requires invasive measurement techniques. Therefore, mathematical
modeling is a cost efficient way to test hypotheses and advance our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms
responsible for CC.
In a preliminary mathematical model of CC from this group [6], we described and simplified the complex
cellular interactions in CC to interactions of several cell types that produce the extracellular matrix (ECM)
collagen. Collagen density was used as a surrogate for tissue “stiffness”, assumed to create feedback amplifying
the inflammatory cycle. The model neglected the deformation, stress, and cellular mechanosensitivity, factors
that have been recognized as important determinants of cellular dynamics. Our aim in this paper is to derive
and investigate a mechanochemical model that takes these factors into account.
Mechanical models of living tissue were proposed in [7], and used in [8] to study wound healing.
Villa et
al. [9] use similar ideas to investigate patterns of cell and stress distribution that arise from distinct constitutive
relations for tissue mechanical properties. Such mechanical considerations were neglected in our earlier model
of CC [6]. Here, we build upon that model to include interactions and spatial distributions of cells, collagen,
and stress. We derive a minimal partial differential equation (PDE) model, estimate its parameters from the
literature, and examine its behavior.
We address the following questions: (1) What are the mechanochemical factors and interaction at the cellular
level that drive the development of CC? (2) What patient factors influence the risks and severity of CC outcomes?
(3) What are potential treatment strategies targeting these risk factors?

Model derivation
It is known that the insertion of an implant triggers a foreign body response (FBR) (See [6, 2] for a review.) At
early stages of FBR, macrophages and fibroblasts are recruited to the site [10]. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts
produce collagen [11, 12], one of the most abundant fibrous protein in human breast tissue [13]. High collagen
density found in pathological capsules is often linked to more severe cases of contracture [14]. Collagen is part
of the ECM, providing structural scaffold for for cell movement and cell forces. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts
are contractile cells that can pull on and create tension along ECM fibers. It has been found that stress due to
contracting fibroblasts can recruit remote macrophages [15].
To highlight the role of mechanical feedback, we consider here a simple model with a single force-producing
cell type, collagen production, and mechanosensitive cell recruitment. This feedback mechanism is depicted in
Figure 1. In an effort to investigate the role of this feedback mechanism in CC formation, we model different
assumptions about (1) stress-dependent cell recruitment; (2) cell traction forces.
Figure 1: Schematic diagram for the model, adapted from [6]. Cells (density n(x, t)) produce collagen fibers
(density ρ(x, t)) and create stress (σ(x, t)) by exerting traction forces (τ(n, ρ)) on those fibers. Stress (based on
Kelvin-Voight constitutive relation) amplifies further recruitment of cells, resulting in positive feedback that we
hypothesize could act as a driver of capsular contracture.
Many biomechanical models of tissue are posed in 2D or 3D geometry, in order to account for full shape
2
deformation. But here, our main interest resides in the cell-level mechanisms, and we do so in the simplified
1D geometry shown in Figure 2. In our 1D domain, the spatial dimension represents the distance away from
the implant. While it is clear that the stress field is a three-dimensional field that needs to be specified in the
full geometry, our interest here is to identify the effect of longitudinal contraction away from the capsule, which
justifies our choice.
Figure 2: Left: schematic diagrams of normal capsule and CC, depicting thickening of the capsule and defor-
mation in the latter. Right: A simplified 1D model geometry. We consider a thin 1D tube of capsule tissue
along the x-axis, where x is the distance of tissue from the implant site, 0 ≤x ≤L.
In the following derivations, we let n(x, t), ρ(x, t) be densities of cells and collagen, and we denote by u(x, t), v(x, t), σ(x, t)
the displacement of tissue from its original unstrained location, the rate of change of displacement (i.e. velocity),
and the axial stress, at distance x from the implant site at time t, respectively.
2.1
Dynamics of cells
We assume that cells have a basal recruitment rate an, a turnover rate proportional to cell density dnn, and
a random motility coefficient Dn. Importantly, we examine the hypothesis that cells are recruited by stress at
some rate, f(σ), where
f(σ) = a0σ + a1
σk1
σk1
0 + σk1 .
(1)
We will consider the cases where (i) there is no stress-related recruitment of cells (a0 = a1 = 0), (ii) cells are
recruited by stress at a rate linearly proportional to stress (a0 ̸= 0, a1 = 0), and (iii) cells are recruited by
stress at a nonlinear, saturating rate (a Hill function; a0 = 0, a1 ̸= 0, with σ0 ≥0 a constant depicting the
level of stress associated with 50% of the maximal stress-induced recruitment rate; the Hill coefficient k1 > 0
governs the steepness of the response - for large k1 the stress response switches abruptly to its full intensity as
soon as stress is above the threshold level σ0). The terms a0, a1 here could also represent stress-dependent cell
activation, turning quiescent cells into actively contractile cells [16].
Mass conservation for cells on the 1D domain results in the PDE,
∂n
∂t = ∂
∂x(Dn
∂n
∂x −nv) + an + f(σ) −dnn,
(2)
where v = ut is the rate of deformation. This term is analogous to a transport velocity, as it results in a net
rate of displacement of the tissue, which carries cells and collagen with it.
2.2
Dynamics of collagen
We assume a collagen production rate by cells bnn, a collagen decay rate dρρ, a random reorganization rate Dρ,
and a transport flux due to the distortion of tissues, similar to cells. Putting these elements together, we arrive
at the equation for the evolution of collagen,
∂ρ
∂t = ∂
∂x(Dρ
∂ρ
∂x −ρv) + bnn −dρρ.

2.3
Force equation for the cell-collagen system
Following Murray et al. [17], we consider the breast tissue as a linear viscoelastic material with low Reynolds
number (negligible inertial force), and we assume the tissue to be in mechanical equilibrium. In contrast to
Murray et al. [7], where a layer of cells adheres to a substrate, our 1D tissue has no significant adhesion forces
that act as external body forces. Adhesion to the implant is represented by our boundary conditions (BC’s) at
x = 0. Then the total stress on the tissue σ(x, t), satisfies the 1D force-balance equation
∂σ
∂x = 0.
(4)
This assumption implies that stress is spatially uniform in the 1D tissue domain. This stress can be decomposed
into σcells, the stress contributed by cells, and σECM, the stress contributed by the collagenous ECM:
σ = σcells + σECM.
(5)
We assume that cells generate stress by pulling on collagen fibers, in the form
σcells = g(n, ρ) = τ1nρ + τ2
nk2
nk2
0 + nk2 ρ.
Here the g(n, ρ) is the traction force as a function of cell and collagen density. We will consider two cases where:
(i) the traction force is linearly proportional to both cell and collagen density (τ1 ̸= 0, τ2 = 0); (ii) the traction
force is linearly proportional to collagen density, and is a nonlinear saturating function of cell density, taken
to be a Hill function (τ1 = 0, τ2 ̸= 0). The case of k2 > 1 represents cell cooperativity, that is, the switch to
greater pulling activity when cell density exceeds some critical level n0 > 0. Such effects is associated with local
cell signaling and mechanosensitivity.
To close the system, we need to make some constitutive assumption about how tissue deformation results from
mechanical forces. Living tissue can be modelled as a viscoelastic material. A constitutive relation is used
to describe the stress-strain relationships of viscoelastic material such as the ECM. In [9], six variants of the
constitutive relations were investigated. Here we adopt the Kelvin-Voigt case, a common and well-supported
assumption for tissue [18, 19]. The corresponding stress-strain constitutive equation is
σECM = Eϵ + ηϵt,
where E and η denotes the Young’s modulus and the viscosity coefficient of the collagenous ECM, respectively,
and ϵ is the strain, given simply in 1D by
ϵ = ux,
so that, we have
σECM = Eux + ηutx.
With these assumptions, we can combine equations (4) and (5), to obtain
Euxx + ηutxx + g(n, ρ)x = 0.
This single PDE links derivatives of the displacement to the traction forces created by cells contracting and
pulling on collagen.

2.5
Unstressed homogeneous steady state
Consider the case of unstressed tissue where σ = 0 everywhere. Then (6) has a homogeneous steady state (HSS)
where cells and collagen are at the levels
nSS = an/dn,
ρSS = nSS(bn/dρ) = anbn/dndρ.
(7)
We anticipate that far away from the implant, the cell and collagen density would be given by these unstressed
steady state levels, leading to our boundary conditions.
2.6
Boundary conditions
We use the following boundary conditions for the mechano-CCl model. We assume that the implant is imper-
meable to cells and collagen, implying no flux of cells and collagen at x = 0. We also assumed that cell and
collagen densities drop to their normal unstressed HSS level far away from the implant (x = L). We assume
that the displacement of tissue is zero at both boundaries.

4. We will also explore the possible effect of other BCs for u later.

Scaling and approximating the model

Dimensional analysis
We scale space, time, cell density, collagen density, and stress,
x∗= x
L,
t∗= t
T ,
n∗= n
N ,
ρ∗= ρ
ϱ,
u∗= u
L,
σ∗= σ
S .
We choose to scale time by the cell residence time T = 1/dn, space by the distance of random cell motion over this
characteristic time, L = √DnT. Cell density is scaled by its unstressed homogeneous steady state,N = nSS.
Collagen density is scaled by its unstressed HSS multiplied by the ratio of turnover rate of collagen to cells
ϱ = ρSS · (dρ/dn). The resulting choices for scales is then
T = 1

Note that we did not choose to scale x by the domain length since this can vary greatly between patients.
Additionally, cho
Transforming the variables and simplifying the PDEs leads (after dropping the *’s) to the dimensionless model
nt = nxx −(nv)x + 1 + f(σ) −n,

The dimensionless parameters have the following interpretations: a is a fold-multiple for the stress-induced
amplification of basal cell recruitment. D2 is a ratio of random rearrangement/dispersal of collagen to cells. N0
is a scaled threshold cell density at which cooperative cell traction forces are switched on (expressed as a fold-
multiple of the unstressed HSS cell density). d2 is the ratio of collagen to cell turnover rates. The mechanical
parameters are all scaled by a reference stress level that is model dependent. Hence, E1, η1 are scaled elastic
modulus and viscosity. τ ′
1 is the ratio of two stresses: traction force produced at the low (unstressed HSS) cell
and collagen densities relative to the reference stress. Similarly, τ ′
2 is a ratio of maximal traction force (at high
cell densities and HSS collagen) to the reference stress level.
3.2
Approximating an analytic solution
In this section, we consider the following version of our model (9) by setting a0 = 0, τ ′
1 = 0. The model (9) is
nonlinear and not analytically tractable as is, but a few approximations can be made to reveal its basic behavior.
First, we look for steady state solutions, satisfying nt = ρt = ut = 0, leading to
nxx + 1 + a

(10d)
We consider the case of a sharp response, namely when the Hill coefficient, k1, is large enough so that the Hill
function can be approximated by a switch-like (Heaviside) function
σk1
1 + σk1 = Heaviside(σ −1) =

0
for σ < 1,
1

(11)
In this case, the model can be solved explicitly, resulting in the cell density distribution

1 + a + nSS−1−a

(12)
We can plot these solutions and compare them against the numerical results produced by a MATLAB BVP
solver (detailed in Appendix B).

Parameter estimation
In many cases, the estimation of parameters is restricted by the availability of data in existing literature. We
collected quantitative information for various cell types known to be implicated in CC, including macrophages,
fibroblasts and myofibroblasts to create a composite cell parameter regime. Many species, sources and types
of studies were used to gain some preliminary estimates. From such studies, we assembled the values for key
parameters.
Some preliminary parameters in the full model (8) are important for our dimensionless model (9). Because we
are interested in cell-scale events, we converted all quantities to units of µm, and seconds. We summarize the
values for these parameters in Table 1 and explain briefly how they are estimated. Fuller details are available
in Appendix C.

Cell densities and dynamics: Our model (6) contains a single cell type that depicts a composite of the
properties of various cells implicated in CC. Actual cells that participate in the process of healing include
7
macrophages, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts. We used data for each, where available, to estimate “cell param-
eters”. Quantification of macrophage density, recruitment, and turnover was obtained from modeling studies of
immunological responses in tuberculosis [20], and from non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [24]. Some data was
also available in [23] for cell response to skin injury. Recruitment of myofibroblast in response to macrophages
was obtained from [22]. We found values for myofibroblast dynamics in cardiac injury in [26].
Collagen density and dynamics: We found sources for typical collagen density in murine mammary tissues
in [21]. Collagen production by dermal fibroblasts was given in [27], from which we could estimate a typical
rate of collagen secretion by cells. The timescale of collagen turnover is based on recovery from cardiac injury
data in [28].
Tissue properties and forces: The elastic modulus for normal and cancerous breast tissue and tissue phan-
toms was available from [30]. Cell traction forces were estimated based on corneal fibroblasts studied by [31].
Further details about the derivation of dimensionless parameters, and selection of appropriate initial conditions
are explained in Appendix D.

Numerical simulation
Following the approach of Villa et al [9], we discretize the equations with respect to the spatial variable x
using finite differences, and solve the model as a system of ODEs with respect to time (method of lines). We
use the implicit MATLAB ODE solver ODE15i to solve the resultant system of ODEs. The final outcomes
are compared with approximate analytic solutions and numerical approximation of BVP results. To remove
numerical instabilities, a small regularizing term is added to the collagen equation.
With this adjustment,
detailed in Appendix A, the method is stable and accurate over a large range of parameters.

Simulation results

The notation
“Hill(n)ρ” means a Hill function in cell density n, and proportional to collagen density ρ. The figures corre-
sponding to the above variants are indicated.
We run the two variants with no stress-related cell recruitment (v-NL and v-NH) with various initial conditions
for cells, representing various initial immune response severity. Figure 4, shows the time progression of cells,
collagen, and displacement vs distance from the implant. (Grey arrows depict time progression.) Simulation
results were consistent across a range of initial conditions over these two model variants, and over a range of
reasonable values for τ ′
1 and τ ′
2. The final outcomes of these models consistently shows a spatially uniform cell
and collagen density profile. We characterize these results as “healthy outcomes” in Table 2 since neither cells
nor collagen is elevated. These model variants do not account for progression to CC. While cells can contract
and cause traction forces and stressed tissue, that stress does not amplify cell recruitment in v-NL and v-NH.

and collagen densities, and displacement in model variant v-NL. Note that the collagen density and displacement
at t = 1 overlaps with the solution at t = 1000, and is therefore not visible on the graph. All variables resolve
to a spatially homogeneous steady state (HSS). Parameters and initial conditions given in (17).
5.1.1
Only pathological outcomes observed in the absence of multiple cooperative feedback
mechanisms
Next, we explore the model variants with stress-related cell recruitment proportional to stress, for both types
of traction force assumptions (v-LL and v-LH). Figure 5 displays the results for variant v-LL. In the range of
parameters of interest, we find that the model always leads to a pathological outcome with elevated cells and
collagen, regardless of initial conditions (close to the HSS). This suggests that a linear feedback relationship
between cell-induced tissue stress and cell recruitment to the tissue is too extreme, leading to a bias towards
the CC outcome. The same results are observed in the time behavior of variants v-LH and v-HL (not shown).

sion of cells and collagen densities, and displacement in model v-LL. Parameters and initial conditions given in
(18).
In Figure 6, we observe that higher values of τ ′
1 lead to higher steady state concentrations of cells and collagen
near the implant site.

Figure 6: More severe pathological outcome with increased traction parameter in model v-LL.
Steady state profile of cell and collagen concentration in model v-LL. We see that an elevated cell concentration
is always formed at the implant site, and higher values of the dimensionless parameter τ ′
1 lead to higher cell
and collagen concentration. Initial conditions and parameter values in (18), with τ ′
1 values in the figure legend.
Model v-LH (stress-related cell recruitment proportional to stress, traction force a Hill function of cell density)
leads to the same qualitative result as v-LL, with low ICs still leading to pathological outcomes. In Figure 7,
we observe that higher τ ′
2 leads to higher steady state concentrations.
Figure 7: More severe pathological outcome with increased traction parameter in model v-LH. As
in Figure 6, but for model v-LH. We see that an elevated cell concentration is always formed at the implant
site, and higher values of the dimensionless traction parameter τ ′
2 lead to higher cell and collagen concentration.
Initial conditions and parameter values (19), with τ ′
2 values in the figure legend.
Model v-HL (stress-related cell recruitment a Hill function of stress, traction force proportional to cell density)
also leads to only pathological steady state results. Changing the values of τ ′
1 and the initial conditions has
no effect on the final steady state profile. However, as shown in Figure 8, higher values of a will lead to a
higher final cell and collagen concentration at the implant site. This indicates that an elevated stress-related
cell recruitment during an immune response will increase the severity of outcomes.

implant site, and higher values of a lead to higher cell and collagen densities. Initial conditions and parameter
values in (20), with a values in the figure legend.
5.1.2
Bistable behavior observed with multiple cooperative feedback mechanisms
With model v-HH (stress-related cell recruitment described by a Hill function of stress, traction force given by a
Hill function w.r.t. cell density), we can classify patients into three distinct categories. (1) Healthy patients:
these are simulated with a set of parameters that will only lead to a spatially uniform SS profile; (2) CC
patients: these are simulated with a set of parameters that will only lead to elevated cell and collagen density
profiles near the implant site; (3) Susceptible patients: these are bistable cases where the result depends on
ICs. This is the first model where we observe bistable behavior, likely due to the incorporation of multiple Hill
function assumptions.
Figure 9 shows two side-by-side panels of initial and steady state cell density for a healthy patient and a CC
patient. A healthy patient will always present with healthy outcome, despite the severity of their initial immune
cell recruitment, while a CC patient will always develop CC, due to their highly elevated immune response.
Figure 9: Cell traction and recruitment parameters affect outcome in model v-HH. Initial conditions
(blue) and predicted final cell densities (red) in model v-HH for patients with distinct physiological parameters.
Left: patient type (1) with low values of traction and recruitment parameters, τ ′
2 = 1, a = 1 recovers to
a uniformly low “normal” cell density (with uniform collagen and no tissue deformation, not shown); right:
patient type (2) with high values, τ ′
2 = 20, a = 5 develops elevated cell density, and collagen and displacement
profiles (not shown) corresponding to CC. Other parameters in (21).
Importantly, susceptible patients may have a healthy or CC outcome depending on the initial immune insult.
We here characterize a pathological CC outcome with
n(0, tend) > 1.1nSS,
11
as immune cell density at the implant site is significantly elevated compared to the steady state value. In Figure
10 and Figure 11, the same set of parameters is used to generate outcomes for a single patient, experiencing
distinct levels of initial immune insult or inflammation. Our results show that bistability can be observed in a
certain parameter regime.
Figure 10: Both normal or CC outcomes are possible in the same patient according to model v-HH.
Initial (blue) and final (red) cell density profiles in model v-HH with two different initial conditions representing
low (left) and high (right) initial inflammation. For low initial inflammation (low initial cell density, left) the
system resolves to a “normal” state with uniformly low cell density (as well as low collagen, and no tissue
displacement not shown). For high initial inflammation (high cell level, right) model v-HH predicts CC (final
steady state with elevated cell density (as well as elevated collagen and tissue displacement, not shown). This
dual prediction is termed bistability. Initial conditions and parameter values in (22).
Figure 11: Outcome depends on initial conditions in model v-HH. Time progression of cell density at
the implant site, n(0, t), predicted by model v-HH. Blue: low initial cell densities eventually resolve to a healthy
steady state value. Red: higher initial cell levels progress to a pathological CC outcome. The switching between
outcomes depends on model parameters in this bistable model variant. Parameters in (23).
The steady state predicted by model v-HH is governed by the scaled cell recruitment and traction parameters, a
and τ ′
2. Figure 12 shows how varying these parameters leads to healthy, bistable, or CC outcomes. It is evident
that larger values of a and τ ′
2 increase the risk of CC.
12
Figure 12: Risk and severity of CC is associated with two model parameters: Model v-HH simulations
predict healthy outcomes (green), bistable behavior (yellow) and CC pathology (red), in this two-parameter
plot with varying values of the dimensionless cell recruitment, a, and cell traction parameter τ ′
2. The size of each
circle is proportional to the final cell density at the implant site, and represents severity. As both parameters
increase, patients become more susceptible to CC with more severe outcomes.
Aside from the model simulations, we can also appreciate the roles of parameters from the way they appear
in the steady state equations, (10) and (12). From the latter equation for the approximate cell density, we
directly see that increasing the dimensionless stress recruitment parameter a will make the elevated cell density
more pronounced. Examining (10), we see that decreasing the collagen turnover rate d2 will increase collagen
density. As the tissue stress is always spatially constant (σx = 0) at steady state, we see from (10) (b) that
larger cell-collagen traction forces (obtained for large τ ′
2 or dense collagen and/or high cell crowding n ≫n0)
can only be satisfied if there is a large values of E1ux, which implies large gradients in tissue displacement (large
ux) and/or significant tissue stiffness (large E1). This provides additional insights into the interwoven roles of
parameters in the model.

Discussion
Some breast-cancer patients are susceptible to capsular contracture following implant-based post-mastectomy
breast reconstruction.
This means that whether they develop CC or not depends on external factors that
influence initial immune cell presence (“initial conditions”), setting the stage for interactions that our model
describes. In order to account for this clinical observation, any model must be able to produce bistable behavior
in some reasonable range of parameters. In such models, a low normal state can coexist with a pathological
state, and initial conditions determine which of the two states will “win”. As shown in this paper, based on the
requirement for bistability, we could rule out some simple model variants that only generate a single outcome
(a spatial uniform steady state). Variants v-NL and v-NH that lacked the stress-dependent recruitment term
were ruled out, implying that stress related cell recruitment is an important factor in our current model.
The requirement for bistability also restricts the type of nonlinear feedback responses. For example, if traction
force is simply proportional to the cell density, or if cell recruitment is proportional to tissue stress, the model
is not bistable.
Taken together, we have identified the key ingredients leading to bistability, namely: (a) cell cooperativity (b)
switch-like response to stress and (c) saturation in both responses to limit their maximal effect.
These responses were modeled by Hill functions of cell density and of stress, respectively. Model v-HH that has all
three of the above properties produces such bistable results. We believe that model variant v-HH can reasonably
represents different levels of susceptibility to CC for breast implant patients. This model has parameter ranges
that include the three classes of patients: those with no risk, with very high risk, and with medium risk that
depends on their initial state or later immune insult. Evidence for the assumption (b) includes pathological
fibrosis, where switch-like effects are common in relation to mechanical stress-mediated cell differentiation [32].
13
As demonstrated by the results in Fig. 12, modeling outcomes can suggest patient risk factors that influence
the likelihood and severity of CC. First, larger values of the stress-dependent cell recruitment rate a1 (relative
to basal rate an) increase both risk and severity. This is seen from the horizontal trend in the figure, where
predominantly greater susceptibility (yellow) and severity (size) of circles occur with increasing values of a (the
ratio of the above rates, i.e. a = a1/an).
From the same result, we found that increasing the maximal cell traction force τ2, which is equivalent to increas-
ing τ ′
2 in Fig. 12, also leads to greater risk for CC: healthy outcomes (green) are replaced by bistable (yellow)
and then inevitable CC (red) in this vertical progression. This implies that the increased cell contractility and
pulling forces leads to higher risks of CC. This progression could correlate with higher incidence of myofibrob-
lasts expressing α-smooth muscle actin or by stronger adhesion of contractile cells to the collagenous matrix,
aspects not explicitly considered in the current model.
Many other parameters can be seen to increase risk and/or severity of the capsular contracture. In hindsight,
these can be understood from the core interactions and positive feedback loop of Figure 1. We see that there is
a chain of events operating in the system. Cell recruitment increases local cell density, contributing to collagen
buildup and a switch to the high-contractility cell state. This creates the tissue stress that, past a threshold,
significantly amplifies cell recruitment. Increasing factors that contribute to that positive feedback would tend
to increase and exacerbate the risk.
Aside from the maximal cell traction force τ2, these include collagen
production rate bn, for example. Increasing the sensitivity of the responses (by decreasing the switching-points
σ0 and n0) also elevates the risk, as the vicious cycle kicks in at lower cell densities and stress. In the opposite
direction, increasing the turnover of cells or collagen (dn, dρ, respectively) is protective, as it reduces the factors
that contribute to that cycle.
The model is minimal, and its limitations should be recognized.
As a notable compromise between model
complexity (many equations with many unknown parameters) and tractability, we have erred on the side of
minimal core interactions, and a single cell type that produces and responds to stress. While this limits the direct
biological application of the results, and hence of clinical relevance, it helps in analysis of the interactions of key
parameters. A future extension of the model, given this initial insight, may include distinct cell populations,
such as macrophages (M1 versus M2), fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts, as they appear at different stages of
capsule formation and have distinct roles [33].
Our model treats cells as a population with no heterogeneity and ignores stochastic effects, typical of most
continuum PDE models. The estimation of parameters, though done by a rigorous search of the literature is
still a limitation of the work. Data specific to patient tissue samples (currently in a planning stage) or obtained
from relevant targeted experimental studies for related pathologies are desirable. Values of parameters related
to tissue stress and cell responses (σ0, n0, τ2, etc.) still need to be refined.
Here we focused on BCs (8). Implementing free or Neumann boundary conditions for displacement at x = L
gives distinct results (not shown). It would be of interest in the future to explore these differences.
While we took parameters to be spatially constant, in actual fact, they may depend on the environment in
proximity (or far from) the implant, and they may vary as the process of healing (or pathology) evolves with
time. There is evidence that cell traction forces increase with stiffness of the cell’s environment [34]. Hence the
parameters τi that represent the magnitudes of those traction forces (here taken as constant) may increase as
the tissue stiffens in early stages of CC, adding important nonlinear effects to consider.
Tissue properties also depend on cell density. Van Oosten et al. [35] showed that a tissue composed of cells
embedded in ECM becomes stiffer when it is compressed (essentially due to the fact that cells are volume-
conserving). This effect is cell-density dependent, so as cells are recruited to the implant, they also affect the
material properties of the tissue. Such nonlinear tissue rheology implies that the stiffness parameter E (assumed
constant in our model) changes as strain and cell density changes. It also suggests that including such nonlinear
rheology tissue properties could be important to take into account in future work.
The 1D geometry of the domain also restricts the applicability of the domain. Indeed, to classify cases into
“normal”, at medium risk, or at high risk of CC, our spatially 1-dimensional model suffices, and considerably
simplifies the solid-mechanics treatment. This is a geometric simplification that could be improved by consid-
ering 2D and 3D anisotropic tissue models, as in [9, 36]. The alignment of collagen fibers would then affect
anisotropic tissue properties that would be require suitable constitutive laws. More realistic geometry in 3D can
be accommodated but would required finite-element simulations. However our goal here was to identify the key
elements that are necessary for CC. We are now in a position to port these elements to more realistic settings.
14
Despite such model limitations, overall conclusions do not depend on specific parameter values, but rather on
the structure of the model and the types of feedback assumed between stress and cell recruitment.
Overall, beneficial treatment strategies to reduce CC risk can be suggested, even in this minimal model inves-
tigation. Briefly, treatments that prevent initial inflammation (anti-inflammatory agents) can protect a patient
against the dangerous “initial conditions” that lead to CC. Local regulation of cell contractility at the im-
plant site could decrease the parameter τ2 whose high values correlate with high risk (Figure 12). Inhibitors
of Rho/ROCK that suppress myosin contraction have such properties. Drugs that locally regulate collagen
deposition could be beneficial (Smad 2/3/4). Local inhibitors of TGF-β (whose downstream effects include
both ROCK and Smad upregulation) may also be relevant [37]. Future models that include more details of
such underlying biochemical signalling could be useful. While current literature identifies the over-expression of
TGF-β as an important indicator of abnormal wound healing, its role in CC is yet to be explored in experimental
and modeling studies.

Conversion factors
Some parameters are given in units of mL and days. We translate all values to time and size scale of cells,
namely µm and s.
1mL = 1012µm3.
1 day = 8.6 × 104s ≈105s.
Density units: We find a variety of units in the literature. For example, in [20], density is given as cells/ml.
To convert to cells/µm3, we use
1cell/ml = 10−12cells/µm3.
17
Density in 2D vs 3D: Many papers provide cell density per unit area in microscopy slides. To convert this
to 3D we make a simple assumption of uniform density throughout a tissue. (See Fig. 13.) Hence if we observe
N cells per unit area, then it implies that the cell inside the whole volume would be approximated as
N 3/2cells per unit volume.
Figure 13: Based on samples viewed in 2D microscopy slides, researchers often estimate the number of cells per
unit area. We here assume that this reflects a view if what is an underlying uniform distribution of cells in the
tissue volume. To convert to density per unit volume we make the simple assumption: if N cells are observed
per unit area in a thin 2D section, then it implies there are N 3/2 per unit volume.
C.3
Literature Support
Since our population of “cells” is a composite of various cell types, we used information about cell types im-
plicated in CC, under comparable contexts, to estimate appropriate parameter ranges. Data for macrophage
density in normal tissue, the macrophage death rate, and recruitment rate in normal tissue and in tuberculosis
(TB) is available from the Kirschner lab, e.g., [20]. Here, the authors estimate normal macrophage density as
105 cells/mL, which equates to our value nSS ≈10−7 cells/µm3. They use these values to estimate the basal
macrophage recruitment rate to be around 330-440 cells /(mL · day), which is equivalent to 3.82-5.1×10−15
cells/(µm3· s). Macrophage-induced myofibroblast recruitment rate can be up to 2-10 times the basal recruit-
ment of myofibroblasts in uninjured tissues [22]. Therefore, we estimate an ≈0.76-5.2×10−14cells/(µm3· s).
The time-course of monocyte/macrophage populations over a few days of wound-healing (right after a skin
injury) is quantified in [23] Table 2 and Figure 2, based on data from rats. The observed cell count in 2D
sections increases from low levels (around 2) to high levels (around 40), i.e. a 20 fold increase, over a period of
1-3 days. If we correct this to account for the cells in a volume, then the increase is ≈203/2 ≈90. From the
rate of decay they measured, we can also estimate a half-life of approximately 10 days, which implies a decay
rate of ≈0.1/day = 10−6/s. In the models of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), [24] suggests a turnover
rate of 0.1-1×10−5/s for macrophages. In a more recent round of papers, with a focus on the effect of cytokines
such as TNF on macrophage recruitment, macrophage death rates are given as 4-6 ×10−3/day, which is in the
range of 4-6 ×10−8/s (Denise Kirschner, table of parameters, personal communication Oct 23, 2023). Once
an immune response is triggered, there are cytokines that inactivate macrophages, which tends to increase the
turnover rates (i.e. rates of inactivation of activated macrophages) by a factor of 10-20. This brings the range of
turnover rate to 0.4-1.2 ×10−6/s. According to [25] which cites [26], myofibroblasts peak 1-2 weeks after cardiac
injury, and decay 21-28 days afterwards. This suggests a turnover rate of ≈1/28 = 0.035/day ≈3.5 × 10−7/s.
From all the sources above, we obtain dn ≈0.35-10 × 10−6/s.
Typical collagen density in mice mammary tissues is in the range of 1.3-3 × 10−12mg/µm3 according to [21]. In
[27], collagen production by control group dermal fibroblasts is 29.8-82.84 pmoles hydroxyproline (OHpro)/105
cells/hour. Hyproxyproline accounts for 15-22% of amino acid in collagen, with collagen having a molar mass of
3×105 g/mol. We estimate a normal rate of collagen production by fibroblasts at bn ≈0.5 - 1.4×10−11mg/cells/s.
In [28], we get some information about the timescale of collagen turnover in the context of cardiac injury (in
rats). There are various collagen types that are more (Types I) or less (Type III) resistant to degradation.
Collagen breakdown starts hours after injury and continues for 3-4 days. According to [28], collagenase activity
is already increased by day 2 (by 4.5-fold) and is highest at day 7 (6.5-fold). This suggests that we can use a
collagen decay timescale of roughly 1 week in the context of healing, so dρ ≈1.6 × 10−6/s.
The elastic modulus for normal breast tissues found in literature ranges from E ≈2.34-4.16 kPa, while in
fibrocystic and cancerous breast tissues it can increase to roughly 5-10 times its normal value.[29]. In phantom
tissues, η/E is approximately 7 ms [30]. We can use this to estimate η ≈16.4-29.1 N· s/m2.
In [31], individual cell traction forces were detected at 100-300 Pa for fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, on a
collagen gel with density 100µg/mL. If we assume that at each point in our 1D domain, traction force is
18
generated by 1 cell, then τ1n ≈τ2f(n) ≈1-3×1015Pa/(mg/µm3).
From here we get the estimates τ1 ≈
1-3×1022Pa/(cells/µm3)/(mg/µm3) and τ2 ≈1-3×1015Pa/(mg/µm3).

Table 4: Table of dimensionless parameters. Some can be estimated from literature data given in Appendix C.
Other parameters are a range of estimated fold-multiples of the basal rates that stem from the effect of injury,
surgery, immune response etc.
Many of these estimates are based on modifications of the preliminary parameter estimates that are also suitable
for stability of the numerical simulation.
In what follows, we use the notation * to denote dimensionless
quantities. In the text of the paper, we later drop the *’s for notational convenience.
Homogeneous steady state cell density, nSS: A typical steady state cell density is nSS ≈10−7 cells/µm3.
We chose this as the reference cell density, that is we define
N = nSS = an
dn
= 10−7cells/µm3.
(After scaling, the dimensionless HSS cell density is n∗
SS = nSS/N = 1).
The above typical cell density, and other information is consistent with typical recruitment and turnover pa-
rameter values an = 5 × 10−14 cells/(µm3· s) and dn = 5 × 10−7/s.
Initial immune cell density at the implant site, n(0, 0): According to [38], in keloid scars, activated
macrophage density is 2.3 times its density in uninjured tissue.
In chronic nerve compression injuries, the
ratio of macrophage density in injured tissues to normal tissues is 10-12 times [39]. We therefore estimate
n(0, 0) =1-10×nSS. A similar factor applies to the scaled cell densities.
Basal steady state collagen density, ρSS: We use a typical collagen density, ρSS = 2 × 10−12mg/µm3 for
the basal collagen steady state. We keep the same choices of values for an, bn, and choose bn = 10−11mg/cells/s.
For the collagen reference value, we hence use
ϱ = anbn
d2n
≈2 × 10−12mg/µm3,
The scaled collagen HSS is then ρ∗
SS = ρSS/ϱ = 1.
Scaled cell recruitment rate, a: The dimensionless parameter a represents the ratio of stress-related cell
recruitment rate to basal recruitment rate. There is no supporting literature on which to base specific estimates,
19
so we assume that 1 ≤a ≤5. In this way, the effect of stress is at least to double cell recruitment (when a = 1)
or increase it significantly (for a ≈5).
Diffusion rates, D2: D2 represents a ratio of random collagen rearrangement, Dρ, to the rate of random cell
motility, Dn. Collagen does not “diffuse” on the timescale of cell random motility, though it gets reorganized
and randomly redistributed through cell activity. We mainly need to consider Dρ in the model to regularizing
the numerical method. We found that D2 = 0.1 suffices for that purpose.
Turnover rate, d2: This dimensionless parameter is the ratio of collagen to cell turnover rates. To fit the
desired model behaviour (uniform steady state collagen density in healthy cases), we took d2 ≈1. This implies
that at early stages, cells turnover and collagen turnover operate on a similar timescale, as cells transit in and
out of the injured area and actively remodel (secrete and degrade) collagen.
Reference stress level S: Typically stress in human tissue is measured in the unit of kPa (ranges observed
≈0.1-2.4 kPa), values that guide some choices we made.
However, as there are three model cases considered, we select three appropriate choices of the dimensionless
parameter S as a reference scale.
For v-LL, v-LH, we can assume that a0σ ≈5-10an for an elevated effect of stress-related cell recruitment rate
compared to the basal rate. Typically stresses in human tissues is measured in the unit of kPa (ranges observes
≈0.1-2.4 kPa), therefore we can assume S = an
a0 ≈0.01-0.48 × 103 Pa. For v-HL, v-HH, we may assume that
the rate of activation for stress-related cell recruitment, σ0, falls into the same order of magnitude as an
a0 , due
to the lack of support literature on this value.
v-NL, v-NH: We identify S = E ≈2.34-3.16 · 103 Pa. We select
S = E ≈3 · 103 Pa.
Then
E1 = E
S ≈1, η1 = ηdn
S
≈10−8, τ ′
1 = τ1a2
nbn
Sd3n
≈10−6-10−2, τ ′
2 = τ2anbn
Sd2n
≈10−4-0.1.
v-LL, v-LH, v-HL, v-HH: For v-LL, v-LH, we assume that a0σ ≈5-10an for the stress-related amplification
of cell recruitment (relative to the basal rate).
Based on the typically stress in human tissue, we assume
S = an/a0 ≈0.01-0.48 × 103 Pa. v-HL, v-HH share these parameter values as discussed. Hence, we pick
S ≈an
a0
≈σ0 ≈30 Pa.
Then
E1 ≈100, η1 ≈10−6, τ ′
1 ≈10−4-1, τ ′
2 ≈10−2-30.
Hill function coefficients: In order to simulate a smooth switch-like mechanism, we set k1 = k2 = 5.
Additionally, we set N0 = 2 based on previous arguments for elevated cell recruitment.
