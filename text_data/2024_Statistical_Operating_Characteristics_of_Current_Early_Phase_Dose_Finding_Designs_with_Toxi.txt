Abstract: Traditional phase I dose finding cancer clinical trial designs aim to deter-
mine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the investigational cytotoxic agent based on
a single toxicity outcome, assuming a monotone dose-response relationship. However, this
assumption might not always hold for newly emerging therapies such as immuno-oncology
therapies and molecularly targeted therapies, making conventional dose finding trial designs
based on toxicity no longer appropriate. To tackle this issue, numerous early phase dose
finding clinical trial designs have been developed to identify the optimal biological dose
(OBD), which takes both toxicity and efficacy outcomes into account. In this article, we
review the current model-assisted dose finding designs, BOIN-ET, BOIN12, UBI, TEPI-2,

PRINTE, STEIN, and uTPI to identify the OBD and compare their operating character-
istics. Extensive simulation studies and a case study using a CAR T-cell therapy phase I
trial have been conducted to compare the performance of the aforementioned designs under
different possible dose-response relationship scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate
that the performance of different designs varies depending on the particular dose-response
relationship and the specific metric considered. Based on our simulation results and practical
considerations, STEIN, PRINTE, and BOIN12 outperform the other designs from different
perspectives.

Introduction
Finding the right dose is crucial in early phase cancer clinical trials due to the safety concerns
of adverse events induced by any oncology drug under investigation. There are numerous
real world examples where the dose on the label of an approved oncology drug is not the
dose administered in practice17;18. This implies that early phase dose finding oncology trials
need to be carefully designed to determine the optimal dose of the investigational agent that
can be used in late phase trials and the target population. In this regard, many early phase
oncology dose finding methods have been proposed in the past few years.
The current existing dose finding methods can be categorized into algorithmic or rule-
based, model-assisted, and model-based designs36. The 3+3 design is an example of a rule-
based design, which is commonly used because of its simplicity and ease of implementation.
However, due to the limitations of the 3+3 design1, many model-assisted and model-based
designs were proposed to address them. For example, some popular model-assisted dose
finding designs include the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design8, the mTPI-2
design9;34;20, and the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design16;35. Commonly used model-
based dose finding designs include the continual reassessment method (CRM) design7, the
escalation with overdose control (EWOC) design2, and the Bayesian logistic regression model
(BLRM) design19. All these designs only consider the toxicity of the drug to estimate the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD). This works well for chemotherapies where both the efficacy
and toxicity of these agents increase with dose.
However, traditional dose finding designs based on a single toxicity outcome may not be
appropriate for immuno-oncology drugs and molecularly targeted therapies. For these novel
anticancer agents, although the toxicity of the drug increases with dose, the efficacy of the
drug may not always increase with dose. Additionally, in many immunotherapies, toxicities
are usually low or moderate grade, preventing the observation of a dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT). Also, severe toxicities are rare and often delayed in subsequent treatment cycles,
which may prevent the MTD from being reached21;32. Hence, it is important to identify
3

the dose of such an oncology drug that is efficacious as well as tolerable, which is referred
to as the optimal biological dose (OBD). Recognizing the importance of selecting the right
dose, the FDA has recently launched the initiative Project Optimus4 to reform the dose
optimization and dose selection paradigm in oncology drug development. There has been
an ongoing effort to develop early phase clinical trial designs incorporating both toxicity
and efficacy outcomes to determine the OBD. Model-based dose finding designs aimed at
OBD detection include the Eff-Tox design31, the local logistic model (L-logistic) design37,
the change-point logistic (CP-logistic) model design23, and the Bayesian dynamic model (B-
dynamic) design15. Eff-Tox31 is an adaptive model-based design based on trade-offs between
the treatment efficacy and toxicity probabilities. It is particularly sensitive to the efficacy-
toxicity trade-off contour.
The L-logistic design37 utilizes Bayesian logistic regression to
model the dose-response curve. The CP-logistic method23 introduces a change-point logistic
model to account for the correlation between efficacy and toxicity outcomes. The B-dynamic
method15 leverages a flexible Bayesian dynamic model that considers both toxicity and
efficacy and borrows information across different dose levels. However, a limitation of the
B-dynamic method is that it considers only monotone dose-response relationships.
Furthermore, an increasing number of model-assisted designs extend BOIN and mTPI
by accounting for efficacy outcomes in the dose finding procedures. Some popular extensions
of the BOIN design are BOIN-ET27, BOIN1213, UBI10, and STEIN12, while extensions of
the mTPI design include TEPI9, TEPI-210, PRINTE14, and uTPI24.
BOIN-ET derives
optimal probability intervals for efficacy and toxicity by minimizing the joint probabilities
of incorrect dosing decisions to determine the OBD. UBI, BOIN12, and uTPI use utility
functions to assess the toxicity-efficacy trade-off and select the dose with the highest utility
as the OBD. Unlike UBI, which bases dosing decisions on data from the current dose, BOIN12
and uTPI adaptively compare multiple doses to choose the optimal dose for the next group
of patients. TEPI, TEPI-2, and UBI designs rely on pre-specified decision tables that map
two-dimensional toxicity and efficacy probability intervals to a set of dosing decisions. On
4

the other hand, uTPI proposes a chessboard design that utilizes a two-dimensional square
grid of toxicity and desirability to guide dosing decisions.
Multiple model-assisted designs mentioned above, such as BOIN-ET, BOIN12, and
PRINTE, demonstrated that they are more robust than the Eff-Tox design as they do
not make any model assumptions regarding the dose toxicity and efficacy curves. BOIN-
ET was shown a higher OBD selection probability than CP-logistic27.
Lin & Yin12 ob-
served that STEIN outperforms both L-logistic and B-dynamic in OBD selection percent-
age. TEPI-2, UBI, PRINTE, BOIN-ET, and STEIN demonstrated superior performance
compared to TEPI in terms of OBD selection probability and patient allocation at the op-
timal doses10;14;33. Yamaguchi et al.33 presented evidence that BOIN-ET and STEIN have
similar OBD selection probabilities. Li et al.11 found that BOIN-ET performs better than
BOIN12 in more than half of the scenarios. Shi et al.25 compared BOIN-ET, BOIN12, TEPI,
PRINTE, Joint3+3, STEIN, uTPI, and Eff-Tox by applying the same utility score approach
for OBD selection across all designs. They revealed that BOIN12 and uTPI outperformed
other designs in OBD selection accuracy and minimizing poor dose allocation. Additionally,
STEIN demonstrated the most effective overdose control. However, as discussed by Shi et
al., the designs, except for BOIN12 and uTPI, can underperform when the OBD is defined
based on the utility score method25. Furthermore, they did not consider scenarios where the
true OBD does not exist.
In this article, we compare seven model-assisted early phase dose finding oncology de-
signs: BOIN-ET, BOIN12, TEPI-2, UBI, PRINTE, STEIN, and uTPI. Several model-based
designs, including Eff-Tox, L-logistic, CP-logistic, and B-dynamic, as well as the model-
assisted design TEPI, are not discussed in this article because their performance has been
revealed to be less competitive compared to one or more of the aforementioned model-assisted
designs. To the best of our knowledge, the performance of the selected seven designs, using
their original dose exploration algorithms and OBD estimation approaches, has not been
fully examined in the literature. The goal of our article is to provide comprehensive guid-

ance on selecting an appropriate early phase design under different scenarios in practice and
to offer user-friendly, interactive software that can be used to implement these designs.
This article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some basic design parameters,
OBD definitions, and safety and futility rules. Key concepts of different early phase dose
finding designs are described in Section 3.
Extensive simulation studies and sensitivity
analyses are presented in Section 4, and a case study is featured in Section 5. Section 6
provides the design guidance and software information. Further discussion is provided in
Section 7.

Notations
Consider an early phase trial with binary toxicity and efficacy outcomes and a total of D dose
levels. The true toxicity probability and efficacy probability for the d-th dose level are defined
as pd and qd, respectively, d = 1, . . . , D, where pd and qd are assumed to be independent. The
toxicity probabilities are assumed to be strictly increasing, i.e. p1 < . . . < pD. However, the
efficacy probabilities are assumed to have an unknown dose-response relationship. From Lin
et al.13, the combination of a binary toxicity outcome and a binary efficacy outcome consists
of four different outcomes: 1 = (no toxicity, efficacy); 2 = (no toxicity, no efficacy); 3 =
(toxicity, efficacy); 4 = (toxicity, no efficacy). The number of patients of the i-th outcome
under dose level d is denoted by yd,i, i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Let yd,T = yd,3 + yd,4 and yd,E = yd,1 + yd,3
be the number of patients experiencing a DLT and efficacy response under dose level d,
respectively, and nd = P4
i yd,i be the total number of patients assigned to dose level d. We
further define πd,i and ˆπd,i = yd,i/nd as the true probability and the observed probability of
the i-th outcome, ˆpd as the observed toxicity rate, and ˆqd as the observed efficacy rate at
dose level d. Then, pd = πd,3 + πd,4, qd = πd,1 + πd,3, ˆpd = yd,T/nd, and ˆqd = yd,E/nd. Assume
that the maximum number of cohorts in the trial is CM, where each cohort represents a
group of patients joining the trial over a certain period. Let the sample size of each cohort
be nc, so that the maximum total sample size of the trial can be expressed as N = CMnc.

2.1
Optimal Biological Dose
The maximum acceptable toxicity probability and the minimum acceptable efficacy proba-
bility are defined as pT and qE, respectively. The MTD is the dose level dMTD which has the
largest toxicity probability not greater than pT, i.e. dMTD = arg maxd pdI(pd ≤pT), which
can be any dose level among the D available dose levels. The MTD may not exist if all dose
levels have a toxicity rate greater than pT. Compared to the MTD, the OBD can be defined
using one of three different methods:
(1) Utility Score: The utility score approach, employed by BOIN12 and uTPI, defines
the OBD by assigning different utility values, {ui}4
i=1, to the combinations of toxicity and
efficacy outcomes, as shown in Table 1. This method offers flexibility and can be extended
to ordinal toxicity and efficacy outcomes. The OBD is defined as the dose yielding the high-
est expected utility calculated as EUd = P4
i=1 πd,iui, with acceptable toxicity and efficacy
probabilities, i.e.
dUS
OBD = arg max
d
EUdI(pd ≤pT, qd ≥qE).
(2) Utility Function: The utility function approach involves a predefined utility func-
tion U(pd, qd) based on toxicity and efficacy probabilities. This method is widely adopted in
designs such as STEIN, TEPI-2, UBI, and PRINTE, although the specific utility functions
may vary. The OBD is the dose level that maximizes this function with acceptable toxicity
and efficacy probabilities, i.e.
dUF
OBD = arg max
d
U(pd, qd)I(pd ≤pT, qd ≥qE).
(3) Maximum Efficacy: The maximum efficacy approach, adopted in BOIN-ET, selects
the dose with the highest efficacy probability and acceptable toxicity probability given by
dME
OBD = arg max
d
qdI(pd ≤pT, qd ≥qE).
When multiple doses share the highest utility value or efficacy probability, the OBD is
the one with the lowest toxicity rate. If no dose level satisfies the criterion of having both
acceptable toxicity and efficacy probabilities, specifically pd ≤pT and qd ≥qE, then the
7

8
true OBD does not exist.
The maximum efficacy approach represents a specific case of
both the utility score and utility function approaches. In the utility score approach, by
setting u2 = u4 = 0 and u1 = u3 > 0, the expected utility simplifies to EUd = u1qd,
thereby designating the OBD as the dose level with the highest efficacy probability. Besides,
in the utility function method, if the utility function, U(qd), depends only on the efficacy
probability, then the OBD is the dose with the highest efficacy probability.
With the true toxicity and efficacy probabilities, each design has its own suggested OBD,
which is the true OBD defined by each specific design, given its pre-specified design param-
eters. We adopted the same OBD definition approach as applied in the original paper for
each design to ensure that the suggested OBD in our paper was consistent with the one
defined in its original paper. In our simulation, we also ensured that the randomly chosen
true OBD aligned with the suggested OBD of each design at the start of each replication. If
a design had a different suggested OBD, we repeated the generation of true toxicity and effi-
cacy probabilities until the alignment was achieved across all designs. A detailed discussion
is provided in the supplementary document.
2.2
Safety and Futility Rules
A dose level d is considered admissible if the observed data indicate that dose level d is
reasonably safe and efficacious, i.e. pd ≤pT and qd ≥qE. After assigning each cohort of
patients to a specific dose level, we check the following safety and futility rules:
(Safety)
if Pr(pd > ϕT | yd,T, nd) > η, eliminate the current and all above doses from the
dose list;
(Futility) if Pr(qd < ϕE | yd,E, nd) > ξ, eliminate the current dose from the dose list.
Only admissible doses can be used to treat patients. If there are no admissible doses to assign
the next cohort of patients to, then the trial will be terminated. Different dose finding designs
use different values for the parameters {ϕT, ϕE, η, ξ}. Specifically, {ϕT, ϕE, η, ξ} equals to
{0.35, 0.25, 0.95, 0.9} for BOIN12, {0.4, 0.2, 0.9, 0.9} for BOIN-ET, {0.33, 0.3, 0.95, 0.98} for

STEIN, {0.3, 0.25, 0.95, 0.9} for uTPI, and {0.4, 0.2, 0.9, 0.7} for TEPI-2, UBI, and PRINTE.
In this paper, we set {ϕT, ϕE, η, ξ} = {0.35, 0.25, 0.95, 0.8} across all the designs to ensure a
fair comparison among all designs.

Methods
3.1
BOIN-ET
BOIN-ET directly extends the idea of BOIN by utilizing both binary toxicity and efficacy
outcomes27.
In BOIN-ET, there are two cut points on the toxicity interval, λ1 and λ2,
and one cut point, η1, on the efficacy interval, which slices the combination of toxicity and
efficacy intervals into 6 regions as illustrated in Table 2. BOIN-ET determines the optimal
values for (λ1, λ2, η1) under the restriction ϕ1 < λ1 < ϕp < λ2 < ϕ2 and δ1 < η1 < δE,
where ϕp and δE denote the target toxicity probability and efficacy probability, respectively,
where ϕ1 = 0.1pT, ϕ2 = 1.4pT, and δ1 = 0.6δE. Takeda et al.27 developed 6 composite
hypotheses and the following decision table as shown in Table 2. The values of these cut
points are selected through a grid search to minimize the joint probability of incorrect dosing
decisions. When 0 ≤ˆpd ≤λ1 and η1 < ˆqd ≤1 are observed, the next cohort of the patients
will be dosed at the current dose level using BOIN-ET, while BOIN chooses a higher dose
level to dose the next cohort. In BOIN-ET, if λ1 < ˆpd < λ2 and 0 ≤ˆqd ≤η1, escalation,
staying at the same dose, and de-escalation are all possible choices due to the unknown dose-
response relationship. On the contrary, BOIN only considers staying at the current dose if
λ1 < ˆpd < λ2. Let c = 1 denote the initial cohort and d = 1 the pre-specified initial dose
level. The dose finding algorithm of BOIN-ET follows:
1.
Treat the cohort c at the dose level d.
2.
Calculate ˆpd = yd,T/nd and ˆqd = yd,E/nd at the current dose level d and follow the deci-
sion table in Table 2 to make the decision of escalation/stay/de-escalation. Specifically,
if λ1 < ˆpd < λ2 and 0 ≤ˆqd ≤η1, define the admissible dose set Ad = {d −1, d, d + 1}
9
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
10
and consider the following cases:
(a)
if dose level d + 1 has never been used before, escalate to d + 1;
(b)
if (a) is not applicable, choose the admissible dose that has the maximum proba-
bility of efficacy according to ˆqd−1, ˆqd, and ˆqd+1;
(c)
if (a) and (b) are not applicable because at least 2 doses have the same maximum
probability of efficacy, randomly choose 1 dose among the doses that exhibit the
maximum probability of efficacy.
3.
Set c = c + 1 and update d based on the decision in Step 2.
4.
Repeat Steps 1 - 3 until the maximum total sample size is reached.
BOIN-ET first applies isotonic regression on {ˆpd}D
d=1 to determine the MTD. For efficacy,
BOIN-ET applies fractional polynomial regression with 2 degrees of freedom to estimate the
efficacy probabilities which allows a non-monotonic dose-response relationship. The model
deviance is used to select the best-fitting model containing 2 powers (k1, k2) from the set
{−2, −1, −0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3}.
Among the tolerable doses, the OBD is determined by the
best-fitting polynomial model.
3.2
BOIN12
BOIN12 is a flexible model-assisted design to find the OBD that optimizes the risk-benefit
trade-off13. BOIN12 defines a utility ui for each outcome i as shown in Table 1. The best
outcome (no toxicity, efficacy) and the worst outcome (toxicity, no efficacy) have the utility
values u1 = 100 and u4 = 0, respectively. The other two outcomes have utility values u2 and
u3 within the range [0, 100]. As specified in Section 2, BOIN12 utilizes the expected utility
to select the OBD, which is the dose level d with the largest mean utility ud = P4
i=1 uiπd,i.
When u2 + u3 = 100, ud = u2(1 −pd) + u3qd. Moreover, if u2 = 0 and u3 = 100, then
ud = 100qd. In this special case, the OBD is the most efficacious dose level. We assume
u2 = 40 and u3 = 60 as recommended by the authors to balance the risk-benefit trade-off.
Lin et al.13 introduced a rank-based desirability score (RDS) for the decisions during the
trial. The standardized desirability of d is defined as u∗
d = 100−1 P4
i=1 uiπd,i ∈[0, 1], which
10
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
11
can be considered as a weighted average of {πd,i}4
i=1. Then suppose xd = 100−1 P4
i=1 uiyd,i
which can be interpreted as the number of events observed from nd patients with event
probability u∗
d. Under the Bayesian framework, assigning u∗
d a Beta(α, β) prior leads to the
posterior distribution of u∗
d given the data to be u∗
d | nd, xd ∼Beta(α + xd, β + nd −xd).
The RDS is the rank of the posterior probabilities of Pr(u∗
d > ub | nd, xd) for all possible
situations, where the benchmark ub for comparison is a constant within the range [0, 1]. In
other words, the next dose level is selected based on the posterior probabilities of the dose
levels in the admissible set. Table 3 of Lin et al.13 is an example of an RDS Table. Let c = 1
denote the initial cohort and d = 1 the pre-specified initial dose level. The dose finding
algorithm of BOIN12 follows from Figure 1 of Lin et al.13:
1.
Treat the cohort c at the dose level d.
2.
Calculate the observed DLT rate ˆpd = yd,T/nd at the current dose level d and compare
it with two constants 0 < λe < λd < 1, where λe and λd are from BOIN16.
(a)
if ˆpd ≥λd, de-escalate to the next lower dose level d −1;
(b)
if λe < ˆpd < λd: (i) when nd ≥6, select the dose from {d −1, d} with larger RDS;
(ii) when nd < 6, select the dose from {d −1, d, d + 1} with the largest RDS;
(c)
if ˆpd ≤λe, select the dose from {d −1, d, d + 1} with the largest RDS.
3.
Set c = c + 1 and update d based on the decision in Step 2.
4.
Repeat Steps 1 - 3 until the maximum total sample size is reached.
To prevent the dose finding process from getting stuck at a locally optimal dose, BOIN12
has an additional dose exploration rule: if ˆpd < λd and nd ≥9 for the current dose, and the
next higher dose level has not been used, escalate to the next higher dose level d + 1. To
select the OBD, there are two following steps: (1) determine the MTD by applying isotonic
regression to the observed toxicity rates {ˆpd}D
d=1 and choosing the dose level with the closest
isotonically estimated toxicity rate to pT; (2) select the dose level with the highest estimated
utility as the OBD among the doses with acceptable estimated toxicity probabilities.

UBI
Li et al.10 developed UBI by combining BOIN with a utility function U(ˆpd, ˆqd) = fE(ˆqd) −
θfT(ˆpd) to incorporate efficacy with toxicity, where

,
λe and λd are the same parameters defined in BOIN and {θ, θEff, θTox} = {2, 0.66, 0.15} are
the three design parameters defined in UBI. Specifically, when θ = 2, the toxicity utility is
considered to be twice as important as the efficacy utility. Let c = 1 denote the initial cohort
and d = 1 be the pre-specified initial dose level. The dose finding algorithm of UBI is as
follows:
1.
Treat the cohort c at the dose level d.
2.
Based on the observed data, calculate ˆpd = yd,T/nd and ˆqd = yd,E/nd, and the utility
function U(ˆpd, ˆqd) at the current dose level d.
(a)
if U ≥0, escalate to the next higher dose;
(b)
if U < −1/3, de-escalate to the next lower dose;
(c)
otherwise, if −1/3 ≤U < 0, stay at the current dose.
3.
Set c = c + 1 and update d based on the decision in Step 2.
4.
Repeat Steps 1 - 3 until the maximum total sample size is reached.
At the end of the trial, the OBD is selected as the dose with the highest utility score
with a utility function defined as U(˜pd, ˆqd) = gE(ˆqd) −θgT(˜pd), where ˜pd is the isotonically
transformed estimate of the toxicity probability from the observed toxicity probability ˆpd,
gE(ˆqd) and gT(˜pd) are truncated functions given by

3.4
TEPI-2
Guo et al.6 proposed an extension of the mTPI design8, called the mTPI-2 design, by
dividing the toxicity interval into subintervals of equal length. This modification aims to
mitigate undesirable decisions that may arise from the mTPI design. Li et al.9 developed
TEPI that extends the idea of the mTPI design by incorporating efficacy into the dose
finding model. Similar to mTPI-2, TEPI-2 improves TEPI by dividing both the toxicity
and efficacy intervals into subintervals with equal lengths, respectively10. TEPI-2 partitions
the toxicity unit into 4 subintervals, {Low, Moderate, High, Unacceptable}, and the efficacy
unit into 4 subintervals,{Low, Moderate, High, Superb}. The TEPI-2 decision table needs
to be pre-determined in consultation with physicians. In the example TEPI-2 decision table
shown in Table 3, the lengths of the toxicity subintervals and efficacy subintervals are 0.08
and 0.2, respectively. Each interval rectangle constructed by a pair of toxicity and efficacy
subintervals is assigned a decision. Unlike BOIN-ET, TEPI-2 escalates to a higher dose level
with low toxicity but superb efficacy. With the observed data, TEPI-2 computes the joint
utility probability mass (JUPM) for each interval rectangle, (a1, b1) × (a2, b2) as
JUPM (a2,b2)
(a1,b1) = Pr(pd ∈(a1, b1), qd ∈(a2, b2) | nd, yd,T, yd,E)
(b1 −a1) × (b2 −a2)
,
0 < a1 < b1 < 1, 0 < a2 < b2 < 1.
The dosing decision for the next cohort is based on which interval rectangle has the largest
JUPM. Let c = 1 denote the initial cohort and d = 1 the pre-specified initial dose level. The
dose finding algorithm of TEPI-2 is as follows:
1.
Treat the cohort c at the dose level d.
13
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
14
2.
Based on the observed data, calculate the JUPMs for all interval rectangles and select
the rectangle (a1, b1) × (a2, b2) with the largest JUPM. The dosing decision of the next
cohort is based on what is given in the PRINTE decision table corresponding to the
rectangle with the largest JUMP.
3.
Set c = c + 1 and update d based on the decision in Step 2.
4.
Repeat Steps 1 - 3 until the maximum total sample size is reached.
At the end of the trial, the OBD is selected as the dose with the highest estimated posterior
expected utility. The utility score function is defined as U(p, q) = f1(p)f2(q), where both
f1(p) and f2(q) are truncated functions, given by

3.5
PRINTE
Similar to TEPI-2, PRINTE is an extension of TEPI and divides the efficacy and toxicity
intervals into subintervals with equal lengths, respectively. Unlike TEPI-2, the decision table
of PRINTE is pre-specified based on the values of the target toxicity rate pT, target efficacy
rate pE, and a small fraction value ϵ. Per the PRINTE decision table, the dose needs to be
de-escalated if pd is greater than pT + ϵ. If pd is not greater than pT + ϵ, the next cohort of
patients is dosed at the current dose d if qd ≥pd or at the next higher dose if qd < pd. An
example PRINTE decision table is presented in Table 4. Let c = 1 denote the initial cohort
and d = 1 the pre-specified initial dose level. The dose finding algorithm of PRINTE is as
14
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
15
follows:
1.
Treat the cohort c at the dose level d.
2.
Based on the observed data, calculate the JUPMs for all interval rectangles and select
the rectangle (a1, b1)×(a2, b2) with the largest JUPM. The decision for the next cohort
is the decision of the rectangle with the largest JUPM from the PRINTE decision
table.
3.
Set c = c + 1 and update d based on the decision in Step 2.
4.
Repeat Steps 1 - 3 until the maximum total sample size is reached.
Once the maximum total sample size is attained, PRINTE determines the optimal dose
by selecting the one with the highest estimated posterior expected utility. Let A(p, q) =
{(p, q) | p ∈(0, pT], q ∈[qE + δ, 1)} be a graduate region and pin = Pr(U(ˆpt
d, ˆqt
d) ∈B), where
B is the corresponding graduate utility region for (p, q) ∈A(p, q). The optimal dose will be
selected as the OBD if pin ≥pgraduate where pgraduate denotes a threshold value. Otherwise,
the optimal dose will be rejected and the OBD will be considered as non-existent.
3.6
STEIN
STEIN12 is another extension of BOIN, which utilizes a frequentist model averaging approach
to estimate the efficacy probabilities. Similar to BOIN-ET, STEIN also has two cut points,
ψL and ψU, on the toxicity intervals, and one cut point, ϕ, on the efficacy interval. Unlike
BOIN-ET, which utilizes a grid search to estimate these cut points, STEIN can directly
calculate these cut points using the same approach as BOIN35. When ˆpd < ψU and ˆqd < ψ,
STEIN also constructs an admissible set for the dosing decision of the next cohort. Let
c = 1 denote the initial cohort and d = 1 the pre-specified initial dose level. The dose
finding algorithm of STEIN is as follows:
1.
Treat the cohort c at the dose level d.
2.
Calculate ˆpd = yd,T/nd and ˆqd = yd,E/nd at the current dose level d.
(a) if ˆpd ≥ψU, escalate to d + 1;
15
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
16
(b) if ˆpd < ψL and ˆqd ≥ϕ, stay at the current dose d;
(c) if ˆpd ≤ψL and ˆqd < ϕ, define the admissible set Ad = {d−1, d, d+1} and select the
dose dNext for the next cohort with dNext = arg maxd′∈Ad Pr(qd′ > ψ | nd′, yd′,E);
(d) if ψL < ˆpd < ψU and ˆqd < ϕ, define the admissible set Ad = {d−1, d} and select the
dose dNext for the next cohort with dNext = arg maxd′∈Ad Pr(qd′ > ψ | nd′, yd′,E).
3.
Set c = c + 1 and update d based on the decision in Step 2.
4.
Repeat Steps 1 - 3 until the maximum total sample size is reached.
At the end of the trial, STEIN uses isotonic regression on {ˆpd}D
d=1 to obtain the isotonically
transformed values {˜pd}D
d=1. For the efficacy outcomes, STEIN performs D unimodal isotonic
regressions on {ˆqd}D
d=1 by enumerating all possible models in the dose-efficacy curve. In the
d′th model, d′ = 1, . . . , D, the dose level d′ attains the highest efficacy probability. With
unimodal isotonic transformations, the transformed efficacy probabilities, {˜qd′d}D
d=1, have
˜qd′1 ≤· · · ≤˜qd′d′ ≥· · · ≥˜qd′D. The pseudo-likelihood based on the d′th unimodal isotonic
regression is given by

The final model averaging estimate of qd is given by ˜qd = PD
d′=1 πd′ ˜qd′d, where πd′ =
˜Ld′/ PD
d=1 ˜Ld. The OBD is the dose level with the highest utility, as defined by the util-
ity function U(˜pd, ˜qd) = ˜qd −w1˜pd −w2˜pdI(˜pd > pT)15, where w1 = 0.33 and w2 = 1.09, as
recommended in the original paper12.
3.7
uTPI
uTPI combines the ideas of modeling dose desirability and the chessboard design method
for dose finding24. Similar to BOIN12, uTPI defines the expected utility or desirability as
EUd = P4
i=1 uiπd,i/100 and the observed utility value as OUd = P4
i=1 uiyd,i/100, where ui is
the utility score of outcome i in Table 1. uTPI assumes that the numerical utility outcome
has a pseudo binomial distribution so that the quasi-likelihood for EUd is L(OUd | EUd) =
16
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
17
EU OUd
d
(1 −EUd)nd−OUd. By assigning a noninformative beta prior EUd ∼Beta(1, 1), the
posterior distribution of EUd is EUd | Data ∼Beta(1 + OUd, 1 + nd −OUd). Unlike the
previous designs, uTPI constructs a two-dimensional chessboard by dividing the joint square
of toxicity probability and desirability into equally sized squares. The toxicity interval and
desirability interval are divided into subinverals, {Ik,T}10
k=1 and {Ik,U}10
k=1, where Ik,T =
Ik,U = [0.1(k −1), 0.1k) for k = 1, . . . , 9 and I10,T = I10,U = [0.9, 1]. The strongest toxicity
interval and the strongest desirability interval are defined as kT
d = arg maxk Pr(pd ∈Ik,T |
Data) and kU
d = arg maxk Pr(EUd ∈Ik,U | Data), respectively. Let k∗denote the index of
the toxicity subinterval such that pT ∈Ik∗,T. Let c = 1 denote the initial cohort and d = 1
the pre-specified initial dose level. The dose finding algorithm of uTPI is as follows:
1.
Treat the cohort c at the dose level d.
2.
Identify the strongest toxicity interval index kT
d and strongest desirability interval index
kU
d for all the dose levels.
(a) if kT
d > k∗, de-escalate to dose level d −1;
(b) if kT
d < k∗, choose dose level d′ from the admissible set {d −1, d, d + 1} that has
the largest kU
d ;
(c) if kT
d = k∗, choose dose level d′ from the admissible set {d−1, d, d+1} if nd < N∗
or from the admissible set {d −1, d} if nd ≥N∗that has the largest kU
d .
3.
Set c = c + 1 and update d based on the decision in Step 2.
4.
Repeat Steps 1 - 3 until the maximum total sample size is reached.
In Step 2, if there is a tie, uTPI selects the dose level d′ with the maximum Pr(OUd′ >
¯IkU
d′,U | Data), where ¯IkU
d′,U denotes the upper boundary of the kU
d′th desirability subinterval.
At the end of the trial, uTPI also applies an isotonic regression on {ˆpd}D
d=1 to identify
dMTD, which is the dose level with the estimated toxicity rate ˜pd closest to pT. The OBD
is selected as the dose level that has the maximum posterior mean of EUd, i.e. dOBD =
arg maxd≤dMT D d
EU d.

Simulation Studies
4.1
Simulation Settings
We conducted simulation studies to compare the operating characteristics of the seven de-
signs introduced in Section 3. The toxicity probabilities are assumed to increase monoton-
ically with dose levels. For efficacy probabilities, we introduce four different dose-response
relationships as follows:
Increasing (I): efficacy probabilities increase monotonically with dose levels, i.e. q1 < · · · < qD;
Constant (C): efficacy probabilities are the same across all dose levels, i.e. q1 = · · · = qD;
Unimodal (U): efficacy probabilities increase monotonically until a certain dose level dU < D,
after which they decrease monotonically, i.e. q1 < · · · < qdU and qdU > · · · > qD;
Increasing-Plateau (IP): efficacy probabilities increase monotonically until a certain dose level 1 < dIP < D,
after which they remain constant, i.e. q1 < · · · < qdIP = · · · = qD.
In the unimodal case, we assumed that dU < D to exclude the increasing case. Note that
the efficacy curve decreases monotonically when dU = 1. In the increasing-plateau case, we
set dIP /∈{1, D} to differentiate this relationship from the constant and increasing cases.
Both dU and dIP were determined based only on the efficacy probabilities. Example toxicity
and efficiency probability curves for all dose-response relationships are given in Figure 1.
Four dose levels were considered for all simulation studies, i.e., D = 4. The maximum
number of cohorts was set to CM = 10 with a cohort size of nc = 3, yielding a maximum total
sample size of N = 30. The maximum acceptable toxicity probability was set to pT = 0.35
and the minimum acceptable efficacy probability was set to qE = 0.25. Common design
parameters were consistently applied across all designs to enable fair comparisons. Specif-
ically, for the BOIN-based designs, BOIN12, BOIN-ET, UBI, and STEIN, it was assumed
that λe = 0.276 and λd = 0.419, given pT = 0.35. For BOIN12 and uTPI, u2 = 40, and
u3 = 60. Each trial, regardless of the design, continued until it reached the maximum total
sample size or was terminated early due to the elimination of all dose levels during the trial.
18
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
19
We adopted the values provided in the original papers for design parameters specific to
each design, such as those in each utility function. However, because our pT and qE differed
from those values used in BOIN-ET, TEPI-2, and PRINTE, some of the design parameters
were adjusted as follows: (1) we set {p∗
1, p∗
2, q∗
1, q∗
2} = {0.2, 0.35, 0.25, 0.6} for TEPI-2 and
PRINTE, which are design parameters in the truncated functions f1(p) and f2(q) for OBD
selection as presented in Sections 3.4 and 3.5; (2) we modified TEPI-2’s decision table to
fit our simulation studies as presented in Table S1 because the length of the toxicity and
efficacy subintervals in the decision table depends on pT and qE; (3) ϕp was adjusted from
0.3 to 0.35 for BOIN-ET, which yields new optimal values of (λ1, λ2, η1) = (0.17, 0.44, 0.48)
through a grid search. Note that “Table Si” denotes the i-th table in the supplementary
document.
4.2
Generating Random Toxicity and Efficacy Probabilities
A total of 80,000 independent replications were carried out for each dose-response relation-
ship, where 40,000 replications included the true OBD, while the remaining 40,000 did not.
As outlined in Section 2.1, the OBD exists only if a dose d meets the criteria of pd ≤0.35
and qd ≥0.25. To ensure that we generated realistic toxicity and efficacy probabilities in our
simulation, we assumed that pd ≤pmax = 0.7 and qd ≤qmax = 0.9 for all dose levels. In every
replication where the true OBD existed, we generated the toxicity and efficacy probabilities
as follows:
1. We first randomly selected one dose level, d∗, as the OBD (among those dose levels that
qualify to be the OBD) with equal probability, and then generated pd∗∼Unif(0, pT),
and qd∗∼Unif(qE, qmax).
2. Let dH be the dose level with the highest efficacy probability, where qd∗≤qdH. If
more than one dose level has the highest efficacy probability, such as in the constant
scenario, dH is the lowest one among these dose levels. Given d∗, we selected dH through
a random process with equal probability among those qualified dose levels. If dH = d∗,
we set pdH = pd∗and qdH = qd∗; if dH ̸= d∗, we generated qdH ∼Unif(qd∗, qmax).
19
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
20
3. After d∗and dH were selected, we generated the remaining probabilities of toxicity and
efficacy by following the procedures outlined in Table 5.
Note that d∗and dH can be different dose levels. For instance, in the increasing scenario
of Figure 1, d∗= 3 and dH = 4. However, d∗cannot exceed dH, because if d∗> dH, we would
have pd∗> pdH under the assumption of monotonically increasing toxicity probabilities. This
contradicts the definition of d∗. Besides, not all dose levels qualify as d∗or dH. For example,
only dose level 1 can be d∗and dH in the constant scenario. Table S3 presents all the eligible
combinations of (d∗, dH) for each dose-response relationship. Additionally, Figure S1 shows
example toxicity and efficacy probability curves for each combination. We also presented
the algorithm for generating random probabilities of toxicity and efficacy in the replications
where no OBD exists in Table S4.
For a fair comparison, it is crucial that the suggested OBD determined based on the
given toxicity and efficacy probabilities is consistent across all designs. Therefore, in every
replication, the process of generating these probabilities was repeated until they satisfied this
requirement. Table S5 provides a breakdown of the frequency with which each dose level was
chosen as the true OBD under each dose-response relationship. The table demonstrates that
each dose level that qualifies to be the true OBD has an equal probability of being selected
as the true OBD.
4.3
Results
We evaluated seven dose finding designs using seven distinct performance metrics:
-
pOBD: the proportion of trials that successfully select the OBD given the OBD exists;
-
nOBD: the average number of patients assigned to the OBD given the OBD exists;
-
nover: the average number of patients assigned to dose levels with toxicity probabilities
greater than pT + 0.1 given the OBD exists.
-
ppoor: the proportion of trials that assign less than 20% of patients to the OBD given
the OBD exists;
20
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
21
-
pno: the proportion of trials that successfully do not select any dose level when the
OBD does not exist;
-
nno,over: the average number of patients assigned to dose levels with toxicity probabil-
ities greater than pT + 0.1 when the OBD does not exist;
-
nno: the average number of treated patients when the OBD does not exist.
The first four metrics are applicable when the OBD exists, while the last three are used
when the OBD does not exist. For each metric under each dose-response relationship, the
value corresponding to the best-performing design is highlighted in bold in Table 6. The
results indicate that no single design consistently outperforms the others across all metrics
and scenarios.
When the OBD exists, in scenario I (Increasing), STEIN exhibits the highest value of
pOBD, whereas uTPI has the second highest pOBD. In scenario C (Constant), UBI leads with
the highest probability of accurately identifying the OBD, with PRINTE closely following
UBI. When the dose-response relationship follows a unimodal (U) or increasing-plateau (IP)
pattern, STEIN has the highest pOBD. Overall, STEIN has the best performance in terms
of pOBD. We compared the selected OBD from each design to the true OBD, averaging the
results across all replications for each scenario. When the selected OBD deviates from the
true OBD, Table S6 shows that, on average, the percentage of cases where the selected OBD
was lower than the true OBD is around 37% for BOIN-ET, 53% for BOIN12, 60% for both
uTPI and STEIN, and is as high as 80% for UBI, TEPI-2, and PRINTE. This result indicates
that UBI, TEPI-2, and PRINTE are more conservative compared to the other designs, and
tend to select lower dose levels as the OBD.
Regarding the metrics, {nOBD, nover, ppoor}, we found that: (1) PRINTE has the highest
nOBD in scenarios I, U, and, IP, while uTPI has the highest nOBD in scenario C. (2) STEIN
has the lowest nover in scenarios C, U, and IP, while uTPI has the lowest nover in scenario
I. (3) In terms of ppoor, BOIN-ET performs the best in scenario I, while STEIN is the best
design in scenarios C and IP, and BOIN12 is the best design in scenario U. (4) In terms of
21
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
22
these metrics, TEPI-2 and UBI underperform compared to the other designs. For example,
in scenario C, while UBI and TEPI-2 have high pOBD values, they also have notably low
nOBD values and high ppoor values. This is because both TEPI and UBI escalate to the next
dose level if the current dose has a low observed toxicity probability and a high observed
efficacy probability, as demonstrated in Table 3 and Table 3 of Li et al.10.
When the true OBD does not exist, PRINTE consistently exhibits the highest accuracy
in not choosing any dose level as the OBD, represented by pno.
TEPI-2 and UBI have
smaller pno values than PRINTE, but they perform better than the other four designs.
While BOIN-ET and STEIN have high pOBD values, they have much lower pno values than
the other remaining designs. For nno,over, STEIN is the best-performing design across all
scenarios, followed by TEPI-2 and UBI. TEPI-2 and UBI have a smaller nno compared to
other designs across all scenarios.
4.4
Sensitivity Analysis
To evaluate the robustness of our simulation findings, we performed five independent sensi-
tivity analyses by changing the following:
(SA1) the number of dose levels to D = 5;
(SA2) the maximum number of cohorts to CM = 15;
(SA3) the correlation between the toxicity and efficacy outcomes to ρ1 = 0.2;
(SA4) the correlation between the toxicity and efficacy outcomes at ρ2 = 0.4;
(SA5) the initial dose level at the beginning of the trial to dose level 2.
In summary, the results of the first four sensitivity analyses, which used the first dose level as
the initial dose, confirm the reliability and robustness of our findings in Section 4.3. However,
in SA5 which sets a different initial dose level of dose level 2, all designs had a decrease in
pOBD and an increase in ppoor, which is particularly noticeable in the case of BOIN-ET.
Detailed results of these analyses are provided in Section 7 of the supplementary document.

Case Study
Another simulation study was conducted using the CAR T-cell therapy phase I clinical trial
example as illustrated in Li et al.10 and Raje et al.22. The patients with relapsed or refractory
multiple myeloma (RRMM) were administered a single infusion at four distinct doses during
the dose escalation phase: 50 × 106, 150 × 106, 450 × 106, and 800 × 106 CAR-positive
(CAR+) T cells. The four doses were defined as dose level 1 through dose level 4. In the
dose escalation phase, 21 patients were assigned using the 3+3 design, with the number of
patients at each dose level n1 = 3, n2 = 6, n3 = 9, and n4 = 3. Based on the observed
DLTs at each dose level, the calculated DLT rates, {ˆpd}4
d=1, were 0%, 17%, 33%, and 67%.
The efficacy outcome was assessed using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma. The responders included complete response,
very good partial response, and partial response. The reported response rates, {ˆqd}4
d=1, were
33%, 75%, 95%, and 100%10. The 150 × 106 and 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells were selected for
the dose expansion phase. We assumed pT = 0.35 and qE = 0.25. Due to the high values
of ˆp4 and ˆq4, we set both pmax and qmax to be 1. The values of the other design parameters
were the same as those specified in Section 4.1.
A random simulation was conducted by generating toxicity and efficacy probabilities
based on their observed rates. It was assumed that all the toxicity and efficacy probabilities
have the same uninformative prior Beta(1, 1).
The posterior distributions are given by
Beta(1 + ndˆpd, 1 + nd(1 −ˆpd)) for toxicity and Beta(1 + ndˆqd, 1 + nd(1 −ˆqd)) for efficacy.
We assumed that the true toxicity rates follow a monotonically increasing curve, while the
true efficacy rates exhibit either an increasing (I) or an increasing-plateau (IP) pattern, with
q3 = q4. We assumed that the OBD exists, given the toxicity and efficacy data of dose levels
2 and 3. Based on the observed toxicity and efficacy rates, dose level 3 is the suggested
OBD for all designs. However, dose level 2 had a much lower observed toxicity probability
than dose level 3. It had a high observed efficacy probability, resulting in a high observed
utility score and a high observed utility function value. Due to the small sample size, dose
23
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
24
level 2 can potentially be the true OBD, as the actual toxicity and efficacy probabilities are
unknown. Therefore, the true OBD was assumed to be either dose level 2 or 3. For each
combination of the dose-response relationship (I or IP) and the dose level as the true OBD
(dose levels 2 or 3), we conducted a simulation study with 10,000 independent replications
for each of the four combinations. The approach for generating random toxicity and efficacy
probabilities in this case study is detailed in Section 6 of the supplementary document.
Table 7 presents the percentage of times that each dose level is identified as the OBD in
scenarios I and IP. When dose level 2 is the true OBD, all designs show a higher selection
rate for dose level 2 as the OBD, compared to the selection rate of dose level 3 when it is the
true OBD. When dose level 2 is the true OBD, STEIN has the highest values of pOBD in both
scenarios, followed by BOIN-ET. However, when the true OBD is dose level 3, BOIN-ET
and BOIN12 identify the OBD more accurately than the other designs. In all scenarios, UBI,
TEPI-2, and PRINTE select dose level 1 as the OBD around 20% of the time, which aligns
with the conservative nature of these designs as discussed in Section 4. However, dose level 1
is evidently not an optimal choice for the OBD, given its lower efficacy rate of 33% compared
to 75% at dose level 2. Our results regarding TEPI-2 and UBI align with those from Li et
al.10, who conducted a fixed simulation study based on the observed toxicity and efficacy
rates.
Table 8 shows that BOIN-ET, BOIN12, STEIN, and uTPI outperform the other
three designs in terms of pOBD. All designs exhibit similar nOBD, with BOIN-ET having
the highest nOBD. BOIN-ET, PRINTE, STEIN, and uTPI have lower npoor but higher ppoor
values than BOIN-12, UBI, and TEPI-2. Overall, STEIN has the best performance among
all the designs for this case study.

Practical Implementation
Based on our findings in Sections 4 and 5, no single design consistently outperforms the
others across all performance metrics in every scenario. However, we identified three designs,
STEIN, PRINTE, and BOIN12, that demonstrate strong performance under specific metrics
24
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
25
across all scenarios, serving as our guidance for practical users:
(1) STEIN: It has the highest probability of identifying the true OBD and a low likelihood
of poor allocation to the OBD when the true OBD exists. STEIN provides the best
overdose control, regardless of the existence of the true OBD. Based on previous trials
or other prior knowledge, STEIN can be used when there is at least one admissible
dose level among the doses being considered. However, STEIN is not competitive when
the true OBD does not exist.
(2) PRINTE: It allocates a large number of patients to the OBD and few patients to toxic
doses when the true OBD exists. In addition, PRINTE can terminate a trial without
selecting any dose as the OBD with a high probability, if no dose level is admissible.
This minimizes the risk of mistakenly advancing an unsuitable dose to the next trial
phase. However, as a trade-off, PRINTE may expose more patients to toxic doses
compared to other designs when the true OBD does not exist.
(3) BOIN12: It is widely used as an extension of BOIN, which has been acknowledged as
a ”fit-for-purpose” design by the FDA. The software for implementing BOIN12 is pub-
licly available at www.trialdesign.org, which features an interactive and user-friendly
interface. The software also offers pre-defined language for the protocol and the statis-
tical analysis plan, specifically tailored to the BOIN12 design. BOIN12 adopts intuitive
utility scores and an RDS table for OBD selection, which can be easily implemented
by practical users.
The other designs we have examined exhibit various limitations. For instance, BOIN-ET
has a low probability of terminating the trial when the true OBD does not exist.
Ad-
ditionally, its performance can be affected by the choice of the initial dose level. TEPI-
2 and UBI underperform compared to other designs across all four performance metrics,
{pOBD, nOBD, nover, ppoor}, when the OBD exists under scenarios I, U, and IP. uTPI applies
the utility score method, similar to BOIN12, but uTPI has more design parameters and is
more complicated to implement than BOIN12.

Discussion
In this article, we compared seven current innovative early phase dose finding designs, namely
BOIN-ET, BOIN12, TEPI-2, UBI, PRINTE, STEIN, and uTPI. BOIN-ET serves as the
most direct extension of the original BOIN design. Similar to BOIN-ET, STEIN divides the
toxicity-efficacy square into six distinct regions for dosing decisions, but it utilizes unimodal
isotonic regression models for OBD selection. BOIN12 is another BOIN-based design that
applies different utility scores for each combination of toxicity and efficacy outcomes. uTPI
merges the concepts of modeling dose desirability with the chessboard design method. These
four designs formulate an admissible set for dosing decisions when the current dose has an
acceptable observed toxicity rate and a less-than-superb observed efficacy rate. UBI, TEPI-
2, and PRINTE only incorporate data from the current dose level to make dosing decisions,
with the assistance of the corresponding decision tables. UBI uses a utility function that
depends on a complex set of design parameters. TEPI-2 is characterized by a simple dose
finding algorithm, although the procedure for specifying its decision table is subjective.
PRINTE is superior in identifying situations where the OBD is absent, given its integration
of an OBD double-validation criterion.
Our simulation results indicate that no single design consistently outperforms the other
designs for all performance metrics across various dose-response relationships. To account for
complex dose-response relationships, we examined four distinct dose-efficacy curves. When
the OBD existed, STEIN was the best design in terms of accurately selecting the OBD in
scenarios I, U, and IP while UBI had the best performance in scenario C. BOIN-ET, BOIN12,
26
Characteristics of Early Phase Dose Finding Designs
27
and STEIN had low probabilities of poor allocation to the OBD. STEIN consistently assigned
fewer patients to toxic dose levels, regardless of the existence of the true OBD. Furthermore,
PRINTE had the highest probability of not selecting any dose level as the OBD when the true
OBD did not exist, across all scenarios. These findings are consistent with those presented
by Yamaguchi et al.33 and Li et al.11.
Although the list of designs we evaluated overlaps with that evaluated in Shi et al.25, there
are some key differences. Shi et al. only considered the unimodal and increasing-plateau
relationships, whereas we also considered increasing and constant relationships. Additionally,
they conducted simulations only under the assumption that the true OBD exists. In contrast,
we conducted additional simulation studies to compare the designs where the true OBD does
not exist. Furthermore, Shi et al. focused on comparing the dose exploration algorithms
of the designs and applied the same utility score approach for OBD estimation across all
designs. On the other hand, we used the OBD selection approach specific to each design,
as outlined in the original papers. Note that only BOIN12 and uTPI directly adopt the
utility score approach for both dose exploration and OBD estimation. Other designs can
underperform when using this approach for OBD estimation. For example, UBI applies a
utility function for both dose exploration and OBD selection. It is not consistent to change
UBI’s original OBD selection method to the utility score method without adjusting its dose
finding algorithm. Shi et al. showed that with the utility score approach, BOIN12 excels in
OBD selection accuracy and minimizing poor dose allocation, closely followed by uTPI25.
However, we found that STEIN had a higher probability of identifying the true OBD than
BOIN12 with its original OBD estimation approach.
Both Shi et al.
and our findings
conclude that STEIN has better overdose control compared to other designs.
Since the true toxicity and efficacy rates are unknown in real clinical studies, we imple-
mented an objective random simulation approach that generates values from the assumed
distributions of the toxicity and efficacy probabilities, rather than subjectively choosing po-
tentially biased values as the true fixed rates. These distributions of toxicity and efficacy
27

probabilities take into account the inherent uncertainty in these probabilities. In our case
study with the CAR-T example, we extended our random toxicity and efficacy probability
generation procedure by incorporating prior information. In the CAR-T example, we exam-
ined scenarios with either dose levels 2 or 3 as the true OBD, considering both Increasing
and Increasing-Plateau dose-efficacy relationships, of which only one scenario was analyzed
through the fixed simulation studies conducted by Li et al.10.
The early phase designs investigated in this article have several limitations.
Firstly,
BOIN-ET, TEPI-2, UBI, PRINTE, STEIN, and uTPI assume that the safety and efficacy
outcomes are independent, while the true relationship between safety and efficacy may be
complex. However, it has been demonstrated that this independence assumption has neg-
ligible efficacy loss3;5. We analyzed this issue via sensitivity analyses, where we considered
the correlation between efficacy and toxicity probabilities, and reached the same conclusion.
Secondly, designs other than BOIN12 do not consider ordinal outcomes. To the best of our
understanding, gBOIN-ET29 and TITE-gBOIN-ET30 are the two model-assisted designs for
handling both ordinal toxicity and efficacy outcomes. Additionally, all designs assume that
both toxicity and efficacy outcomes will be observed quickly enough to inform the dosing
decisions for the subsequent patient cohort. Implementing these designs may be challenging
in certain immunotherapy trials, particularly those with late-onset or pending toxicity and
efficacy responses or those experiencing rapid patient accrual. To address these challenges,
time-to-event (TITE) designs, such as TITE-BOIN1238 and TITE-BOIN-ET28, have been
developed. Finally, none of the seven designs incorporate pharmacokinetic (PK) or phar-
macodynamic (PD) parameters, nor do they include biomarker data in their dose finding
algorithms. For instance, PKBOIN-12 is an innovative model-assisted dose finding design
that integrates PK, toxicity, and efficacy to optimize dose selection26. In future work, we
will examine the performance of existing designs that incorporate these factors or consider
developing a new design that enhances current methodologies. Clearly, the unique challenges
of oncology drug development call for more integrated dose finding approaches. These should
28

encompass innovative study designs, advanced statistical methods, and cross-functional col-
laborations.

Toxicity:
generate an ascending vector of toxicity probabilities from
Unif(0, pd∗) for dose levels {1, . . . , d∗−1} and another ascending vector of
toxicity probabilities from Unif(pT, pmax) for dose levels {d∗+ 1, . . . , D}.
Efficacy: generate an ascending vector of efficacy probabilities from Unif(0, qd∗)
for dose levels {1, . . . , d∗−1} and another ascending vector of efficacy proba-
bilities from Unif(qd∗, qmax) for dose levels {d∗+ 1, . . . , D}.
Constant
Toxicity:
generate an ascending vector of toxicity probabilities from
Unif(pd∗, pmax) for dose levels {2, . . . , D} where d∗= 1.

(a) generate an ascending vector of toxicity probabilities from Unif(0, pd∗)
for dose levels {1, . . . , d∗−1};
(b1) if d∗= dH, generate another ascending vector of toxicity probabilities
from Unif(pd∗, pmax) for dose levels {d∗+ 1, . . . , D};
(b2) if d∗̸= dH, generate another ascending vector of toxicity probabilities
from Unif(pT, pmax) for dose levels {d∗+ 1, . . . , D}.
Efficacy:
(a) generate an ascending vector of efficacy probabilities from Unif(0, qd∗)
for dose levels {1, . . . , d∗−1};
(b1) if d∗= dH, generate a decreasing vector of efficacy probabilities from
Unif(0, qd∗) for dose levels {d∗+ 1, . . . , D};
(b2) if d∗̸= dH, generate an ascending vector of efficacy probabilities from
