Abstract 
Breast cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with prognosis and 
treatment decisions largely dependent on clinical characteristics. Accurate pre-
diction of patient outcomes is crucial for personalized treatment strategies. 
This study employs survival analysis techniques, including Cox proportional 
hazards and parametric survival models, to enhance the prediction of the log 
odds of survival in breast cancer patients. Clinical variables such as tumor size, 
hormone receptor status, HER2 status, age, and treatment history were ana-
lyzed to assess their impact on survival outcomes. Data from 1557 breast cancer 
patients were obtained from a publicly available dataset provided by the Uni-
versity College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. This dataset was preprocessed and 
analyzed using both univariate and multivariate approaches to evaluate sur-
vival outcomes. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated to visualize sur-
vival probabilities, while the Cox proportional hazards model identified key 
risk factors influencing mortality. The results showed that older age, larger tu-
mor size, and HER2-positive status were significantly associated with an in-
creased risk of mortality. In contrast, estrogen receptor positivity and breast-
conserving surgery were linked to better survival outcomes. The findings sug-
gest that integrating these clinical variables into predictive models improves

may benefit from more aggressive interventions. This study demonstrates the 
potential of survival analysis in optimizing breast cancer care, particularly in

1. Introduction 
Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent and impactful cancers worldwide, 
accounting for significant morbidity and mortality among women. It is widely 
recognized as the most common cancer affecting women, and its prevalence has 
increased substantially over the past few decades due to various risk factors, in-
cluding genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors [1]. Approximately one in 
eight women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer during their lifetime, 
making it a public health priority [2]. 
In the context of survival analysis, log odds is a statistical measure used to 
express the probability of an event, such as survival, in a continuous form. This 
transformation is often employed in logistic regression models and facilitates a 
more nuanced understanding of complex relationships between variables [3]. 
Specifically, the log odds is the natural logarithm of the odds ratio, calculated as  
log 1

, where p represents the probability of survival. By converting survival  
probabilities into a continuous scale, the log odds method enhances the flexibility 
of survival models, allowing researchers to assess how clinical factors, such as tu-
mor size or HER2 status, influence survival. This technique is precious in breast 
cancer research, where small changes in variables can significantly impact prog-
nosis. Incorporating log odds into predictive models helps refine survival predic-
tions, enabling more personalized treatment decisions [4]. 
Despite advancements in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment, predicting 
the prognosis of breast cancer patients remains a significant challenge. Conven-
tional prognosis models such as the TNM classification (Tumor size, Node in-
volvement, and Metastasis) are often limited in their ability to capture the heter-
ogeneity of the disease, leading to suboptimal treatment decisions and patient out-
comes [5]. The TNM system, though widely used, is primarily descriptive and 
cannot integrate various clinical and molecular data points into a cohesive risk 
assessment model [6]. This limitation underscores the need for more advanced

statistical models capable of incorporating a wider range of clinical variables to 
provide more accurate prognoses for individual patients. 
Breast cancer is not a homogenous disease but consists of multiple subtypes, 
each with distinct genetic, molecular, and clinical characteristics. These subtypes 
respond differently to treatment and have varying prognoses, complicating efforts 
to establish a universal prognostic model. For instance, hormone receptor-posi-
tive (HR+) and HER2-positive breast cancers differ significantly in their biology 
and treatment responses, thus requiring tailored therapeutic approaches [6]. Ad-
ditionally, patient age, tumor size, and receptor status (estrogen, progesterone, 
and HER2) significantly affect the prognosis of breast cancer patients [7]. 
Given this complexity, survival analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for 
modeling the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Survival analysis is a statistical 
technique used to estimate the time until a specific event occurs, such as death, 
recurrence, or relapse. Unlike traditional statistical models, survival analysis ac-
commodates censored data, which is common in medical studies where patients 
may be lost to follow-up or remain event-free at the time of analysis [8]. This 
characteristic makes it particularly suitable for breast cancer prognosis, where patient 
outcomes are influenced by multiple factors and often occur over extended periods. 
The Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier estimator, and parametric 
survival models are among the most commonly used methods in survival analysis. 
These models allow researchers to estimate the probability of survival over time 
and identify significant predictors of survival [9]. By integrating clinical variables 
such as tumor size, receptor status, treatment history, and patient demographics, 
survival analysis provides a more nuanced understanding of patient outcomes. 
The Cox proportional hazards model, for instance, is widely used to evaluate the 
effect of multiple covariates on survival time, making it an essential tool in the 
prognosis of breast cancer patients [10]. 
The use of survival analysis in breast cancer research has led to the development 
of predictive models that offer more personalized treatment strategies. For exam-
ple, the incorporation of molecular data, such as hormone receptor and HER2 
status, into survival models has improved the ability to predict patient outcomes 
and guide treatment decisions. In addition, parametric survival models, such as 
the Weibull and log-logistic models, provide flexibility in modeling survival times, 
particularly when the hazard function changes over time [11]. These models can 
handle varying survival patterns and are particularly useful in breast cancer prog-
nosis, where the risk of recurrence or death may fluctuate depending on the stage 
of the disease and treatment modalities. 
This study aims to build on these advancements by focusing on the log odds of 
survival, a transformation that converts probabilities into a continuous scale for 
more sophisticated statistical analysis. The log odds transformation is often used 
in logistic regression to model binary outcomes, such as survival versus death, and 
provides a more refined approach to predicting the likelihood of survival in breast 
cancer patients [12]. By employing survival analysis techniques, this study seeks to

evaluate how key clinical variables—such as tumor size, hormone receptor status, 
HER2 status, and treatment history—affect the log odds of survival in breast can-
cer patients. 
The dataset used in this study includes 1557 breast cancer patients, each with 
detailed clinical and demographic information. Survival analysis techniques, in-
cluding the Cox proportional hazards model and parametric models, will be ap-
plied to assess the impact of clinical variables on survival outcomes. The Kaplan-
Meier estimator will be used to visualize survival probabilities, while the log odds 
of survival will be computed to provide a more nuanced understanding of how 
these variables interact to influence patient prognosis [13] [14]. 
This research is particularly important because accurate prognostic models can 
significantly impact treatment decisions. Breast cancer treatment often involves a 
combination of surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and radiotherapy, and 
the choice of treatment depends heavily on the patient’s prognosis. By improving 
the accuracy of prognostic models, clinicians can better tailor treatments to indi-
vidual patients, reducing the risk of overtreatment or undertreatment [15]. For 
instance, patients identified as high-risk through survival analysis may benefit 
from more aggressive treatment, while those with favorable prognoses may avoid 
unnecessary interventions that could lead to adverse side effects [16]. 
Furthermore, survival analysis has the potential to improve healthcare resource 
allocation, particularly in settings where access to advanced treatments is limited. 
By identifying patients at higher risk, healthcare providers can ensure that re-
sources are directed where they are most needed, ultimately improving patient 
outcomes and reducing healthcare costs [16]. This is particularly relevant in low-
resource settings, where the efficient use of medical resources is crucial to max-
imizing patient care. 
In conclusion, this study will use survival analysis techniques to predict the log 
odds of survival in breast cancer patients, focusing on key clinical variables such 
as tumor size, hormone receptor status, and HER2 status. By improving the accu-
racy of prognostic models, this research aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts 
to personalize breast cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes. 
2. Review of Previous Study 
The use of survival analysis in breast cancer research has gained traction due to 
its ability to model time-to-event data, providing valuable insights into factors in-
fluencing patient prognosis. Historically, the TNM classification system, which 
assesses tumor size, node involvement, and metastasis, has been the cornerstone 
of breast cancer prognosis. However, its limitations in accounting for disease het-
erogeneity have led to the development of more advanced statistical models like 
survival analysis [17]. 
One of the most frequently employed techniques in survival analysis is the Cox 
proportional hazards model. This model allows researchers to estimate the effect 
of various covariates on survival time without making specific assumptions about 
A. O. Sheu et al.

the baseline hazard function [18]. In breast cancer research, studies have shown 
that clinical factors such as age, tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and 
HER2 status are significant predictors of survival. For instance, larger tumor sizes 
and HER2 positivity are associated with increased mortality risks, while positive 
ER status is linked to better outcomes [19]. 
Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier estimator is widely used to estimate survival 
probabilities over time. It graphically represents survival data and provides an in-
tuitive way to compare survival curves between different patient groups. This tool 
is particularly useful in understanding the impact of treatment variables, such as 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, on survival outcomes [20]. Several studies have 
demonstrated that chemotherapy, while improving survival rates in high-risk pa-
tients, may be associated with higher mortality risks in certain populations, de-
pending on clinical characteristics [21]. 
Despite its widespread use, traditional survival models like the Cox model are 
limited by their inability to account for unobserved heterogeneity among patients. 
This has led to the adoption of frailty models, which introduce random effects to 
capture the influence of unmeasured variables. By doing so, researchers can gain 
a more comprehensive understanding of patient survival trajectories and reduce 
bias in their estimates [22]. Frailty models have been particularly beneficial in 
breast cancer research, where patient responses to treatment often vary widely 
based on unmeasured genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors [23]. 
More recent innovations in breast cancer prognosis have focused on the use of 
log odds transformations in survival analysis. This approach, commonly used in 
logistic regression, transforms survival probabilities into a continuous scale, facil-
itating more refined statistical analysis. Log odds models are particularly valuable 
in predicting binary outcomes like survival versus death, providing insights into 
the likelihood of survival based on specific clinical variables [23]. 
Parametric models, such as the Weibull and log-logistic models, have also be-
come more popular in breast cancer research due to their flexibility in modeling 
hazard functions that change over time. These models are especially useful for 
long-term survival predictions, where the risk of recurrence or death may not remain 
constant throughout the follow-up period [24] [25]. For example, the log-logistic dis-
tribution is ideal for modeling survival data with initially increasing and then de-
creasing hazard rates—a pattern commonly observed in cancer patients [26]. 
In summary, survival analysis has proven to be an invaluable tool in breast can-
cer research, enabling more personalized treatment approaches. By integrating 
clinical variables such as tumor size, hormone receptor status, and treatment his-
tory into survival models, researchers can better predict patient outcomes and 
guide treatment decisions. However, as the complexity of breast cancer contin-
ues to evolve, so too must the statistical techniques used to model its prognosis. 
Future research should focus on incorporating genetic markers, lifestyle fac-
tors, and real-world clinical data into survival models to further refine their 
predictive power.

3. Method 
3.1. Data Collection and Preparation 
This study leverages a dataset from the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Ni-
geria, which includes detailed clinical information for 1557 breast cancer patients. 
The dataset was publicly accessible and provided comprehensive data on variables 
such as age, tumor size, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and treatment his-
tory. Before analysis, the data were preprocessed to remove irrelevant or missing 
variables, ensuring accuracy in the survival analysis. 
Key clinical variables were chosen for their relevance to breast cancer prognosis. 
These include age, tumor size, type of surgery, chemotherapy, ER status, HER2 
status, and hormone therapy. The primary outcome of interest was the overall 
survival time, measured from diagnosis to either the event of death or censoring. 
This ensures that the study focuses on predicting survival probabilities with the 
chosen clinical factors. 
3.2. Survival Analysis Techniques 
 Cox Proportional Hazards Model 
The Cox proportional hazards model is a semi-parametric model commonly 
used for survival analysis. It is particularly useful because it does not assume a 
specific baseline hazard function, allowing for flexibility when handling diverse 
datasets like breast cancer patient records. The model estimates the hazard of 
death, which is a function of time and various covariates (age, tumor size, ER sta-
tus, etc.). The hazard function

accommodates both censored data (patients who are alive or lost to follow-up) 
and continuous variables like age and tumor size. 
 Kaplan-Meier Estimator 
The use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator allowed for the visualization of the sur-
vival probability with time. The estimation of survival probability and the creation 
of survival curves are made possible by this non-parametric approach. The fol-
lowing represents the Kaplan-Meier estimator:

tients at risk at a time 
it . Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for various sub-
groups (e.g., patients with HER2-positive vs. HER2-negative status) to assess how 
different clinical factors impact survival. 
 Parametric Models 
For robustness, parametric survival models, including the log-logistic distribution,

were applied to the data. Parametric models assume that the survival times follow a 
specific distribution, allowing for more precise modeling of hazard rates. The log-
logistic survival function is given by:

where λ is the scale parameter, and γ is the shape parameter. This model is useful 
when the hazard rate initially increases and then decreases, a pattern observed in 
many cancer patients. 
 Model Evaluation and Selection 
 AIC and BIC Criteria 
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Crite-
rion (BIC) were applied to determine which model suited the data the best. Com-
plexity models are penalized by both criteria; lower values suggest a better trade-
off between fit and parsimony. Here’s how these criteria are calculated:

L  
(5) 
where k  is the number of parameters, Lis the likelihood, and n is the sample 
size. Models with the lowest AIC and BIC were considered optimal for survival 
prediction. 
 Goodness-of-Fit Tests 
The goodness-of-fit for each model was tested using the likelihood ratio test, 
Wald test, and score (log-rank) test. These tests assess whether the covariates sig-
nificantly impact survival times. The log-rank test, for instance, evaluates whether 
the observed survival curves differ significantly between groups (e.g., ER-positive 
vs. ER-negative patients). 
 Concordance Index (C-Index) 
The predictive accuracy of each model was further evaluated using the concord-
ance index (C-index), which measures how well the model can discriminate be-
tween patients with different survival times. A C-index value closer to 1 indicates 
higher predictive accuracy. Models with higher C-index values were preferred for 
further analysis. 
 Log Odds Transformation 
In this study, the log odds of survival were calculated as a transformation of 
survival probabilities, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of patient risk. 
The log odds function is:

as survival versus death, which is particularly useful for clinical decision-making. 
This methodology integrates survival analysis techniques such as the Cox pro-
portional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier estimator, and parametric models to pre-
dict the log odds of survival in breast cancer patients. These methods, combined 
with rigorous model selection criteria (AIC, BIC) and evaluation techniques (C-
index, log-rank test), provide a robust framework for predicting patient outcomes 
based on key clinical variables such as tumor size, ER status, and treatment his-
tory. The resulting models can help clinicians tailor treatment strategies, particu-
larly in resource-limited settings where precision is critical. 
4. Result and Finding 
The dataset included 1557 breast cancer patients, and their clinical characteristics 
are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 highlights several significant clinical differ-
ences among breast cancer patients based on their survival outcomes. Notably, 
patients who died from breast cancer had a median tumor size of 25 mm, which 
was significantly larger than the 20 mm observed in those still alive (p < 0.001). 
This finding underscores the critical role that tumor size plays in survival out-
comes, as larger tumors are often associated with a higher risk of mortality. Simi-
larly, age was a key factor, with patients who died from breast cancer being 
younger (median age 62) compared to those who died from other causes (median 
age 71), indicating that younger patients with aggressive disease may face a higher 
mortality risk. 
Additionally, the data reveal that 69% of patients who died from breast cancer 
underwent mastectomy, compared to 49% of survivors. This suggests that more 
aggressive surgical treatments, such as mastectomy, are often performed in pa-
tients with higher-risk disease, yet these interventions may not always be sufficient 
to improve survival in advanced cases. The higher chemotherapy rate in patients 
who died from breast cancer (30%) compared to survivors (23%) further supports 
this association with more aggressive treatment protocols for high-risk patients. 
These findings emphasize the importance of early detection and personalized 
treatment strategies, particularly for patients with larger tumors or requiring ag-
gressive surgical interventions.

 Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis 
Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to estimate the survival probabilities of 
patients based on age, tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and HER2 status. 
Figure 1 presents the survival curves for patients younger than 60 years versus 
those aged 60 years or older. The curve indicates that younger patients had signif-
icantly higher survival probabilities throughout the observation period (p < 
0.0001). At the 5-year mark, 60% of patients under 60 were alive, compared to 
42% of those over 60.

Similarly, survival probabilities based on tumor size showed that patients with 
smaller tumors (≤ 20 mm) had significantly better outcomes than those with 
larger tumors (> 20 mm) (p < 0.0001). By the 5-year mark, patients with smaller 
tumors had an 80% survival rate, while those with larger tumors had a 55% sur-
vival rate. 
The Kaplan-Meier analysis also revealed minimal differences in survival between

ER-positive and ER-negative patients (p = 0.19), though ER-positive patients 
tended to have slightly better survival outcomes. HER2 status, however, was a 
strong predictor of survival, with HER2-positive patients experiencing worse 
outcomes compared to HER2-negative patients (p < 0.001). At 5 years, 65% of 
HER2-positive patients had survived, compared to 78% of HER2-negative pa-
tients. 
 Cox Proportional Hazards Model 
The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the impact of various 
clinical variables on survival. Table 2 presents the hazard ratios for age, tumor 
size, ER status, HER2 status, hormone therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and 
type of surgery.

The results show that older age and larger tumor size significantly increased the 
hazard of mortality. Specifically, for each additional year of age, the hazard of 
death increased by 4.7% (HR = 1.047, p < 0.001). Similarly, each millimeter in-
crease in tumor size raised the hazard by 1.1% (HR = 1.011, p < 0.001). HER2-
positive patients had a 59% higher risk of death compared to HER2-negative pa-
tients (HR = 1.591, p < 0.001). Chemotherapy was also associated with a signifi-
cant increase in mortality risk (HR = 1.786, p < 0.001), potentially reflecting its 
use in higher-risk patients. 
 Log Odds of Survival 
The log odds of survival were calculated to assess the likelihood of survival ver-
sus death based on the clinical variables. Figure 2 presents the distribution of log 
odds, which follows a normal distribution, centered around zero. Most patients 
had log odds close to zero, indicating an approximately even likelihood of survival. 
However, patients with large tumors and HER2-positive status had negative log 
odds, reflecting a higher probability of death.

This model shows that age, tumor size, and HER2 status are significant predic-

worse outcomes. Each one-unit increase in tumor size results in a 12% increase in 
the odds of death. 
 Survival by Treatment Modality 
Survival probabilities based on different treatment modalities were also ana-
lyzed. Figure 3 presents Kaplan-Meier survival curves for patients who underwent 
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. 
Radiotherapy was associated with improved survival outcomes, with patients 
receiving radiotherapy showing a significantly higher survival probability (p < 
0.001). At 5 years, 70% of patients who received radiotherapy were still alive, 
compared to 55% of those who did not. Hormone therapy also significantly 
improved survival, particularly in ER-positive patients. Chemotherapy, while 
associated with increased mortality risk in the Cox model, showed improved 
outcomes in lower-risk patients who did not require more aggressive interven-
tions.

the most significant predictors of survival in breast cancer patients. Survival anal-
ysis using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards model re-
vealed critical insights into how these clinical factors impact patient outcomes. 
The findings underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches, 
particularly for high-risk patients with large tumors or HER2-positive disease. 
5. Conclusions 
This study explored the survival probabilities of breast cancer patients by employ-
ing survival analysis techniques such as the Cox proportional hazards model and 
Kaplan-Meier estimator, focusing on clinical variables like age, tumor size, hor-
mone receptor status (ER), HER2 status, and treatment history. The research 
aimed to refine the prediction of survival outcomes by assessing the impact of 
these factors on the log odds of survival, thereby contributing to more personal-
ized treatment strategies for breast cancer patients. 
The findings from the Cox proportional hazards model revealed that older age, 
larger tumor size, and HER2-positive status were significant predictors of in-
creased mortality. Each additional year of age and millimeter of tumor size in-
creased the hazard of death, underscoring the importance of early detection and 
timely treatment. HER2-positive patients faced a 59% higher risk of mortality, 
highlighting the need for targeted therapies for this subset of patients. In contrast, 
ER-positive status and hormone therapy were associated with slightly improved 
survival outcomes, though the effect was less pronounced than other variables. 
The Kaplan-Meier survival curves further illustrated the survival differences 
among various patient groups. Younger patients, those with smaller tumors, and 
HER2-negative patients demonstrated significantly higher survival probabilities. 
These curves visually reinforced the statistical findings from the Cox model and 
provided a clear picture of how clinical variables influence survival trajectories. 
Additionally, treatment modalities like radiotherapy and hormone therapy were 
shown to improve survival, particularly in lower-risk patients, while chemother-
apy, though associated with higher risk in the Cox model, still offered benefits in 
selected groups. 
The distribution of log odds of survival further emphasized the varying risks 
among patients. Those with negative log odds—indicating a higher probability of 
death—were typically older, had larger tumors, or were HER2-positive. This 
transformation enabled a more nuanced understanding of survival probabilities 
and allowed for more precise predictions of patient outcomes based on their clin-
ical profiles. 
The implications of these findings are significant for clinical practice. By incor-
porating age, tumor size, and HER2 status into survival prediction models, clini-
cians can better identify high-risk patients who may benefit from more aggressive 
interventions. Conversely, patients with favorable profiles, such as smaller tumors 
and HER2-negative status, may avoid overtreatment and its associated side effects. 
This personalized approach ensures that treatment plans are tailored to individual

patient risks, improving both outcomes and quality of life. 
Moreover, the ability to accurately predict survival outcomes has broader im-
plications for healthcare resource allocation, particularly in settings where access 
to advanced treatments is limited. By identifying patients who are most likely to 
benefit from specific interventions, healthcare providers can ensure that resources 
are used efficiently, leading to improved patient management and cost-effective 
care delivery. 
In conclusion, this study demonstrated the value of survival analysis in predict-
ing breast cancer outcomes. The integration of clinical variables like age, tumor 
size, and HER2 status into survival models significantly enhances prognostic ac-
curacy, enabling personalized treatment strategies. These insights are crucial for 
improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare delivery, particularly for 
high-risk populations. Future research should explore the integration of genetic 
markers and real-world data to further refine these predictive models and support 
the ongoing efforts to personalize breast cancer care.
