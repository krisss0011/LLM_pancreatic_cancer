Abstract
The development of mathematical models of cancer informed by time-resolved measurements
has enabled personalised predictions of tumour growth and treatment response. However,
frequent cancer monitoring is rare, and many tumours are treated soon after diagnosis with
limited data. To improve the predictive capabilities of cancer models, we investigate the
problem of recovering earlier tumour states from a single spatial measurement at a later
time. Focusing on prostate cancer, we describe tumour dynamics using a phase-field model
coupled with two reaction-diffusion equations for a nutrient and the local prostate-specific
antigen. We generate synthetic data using a discretisation based on Isogeometric Analysis.
Then, building on our previous analytical work, [5], we propose an iterative reconstruction
algorithm based on the Landweber scheme, showing local convergence with quantitative rates
and exploring an adaptive step size that leads to faster reconstruction algorithms. Finally,
we run simulations demonstrating high-quality reconstructions even with long time horizons
and noisy data.

Introduction
Mathematical modelling of cancer dynamics during growth and treatment contributes to gaining
insight into the biophysical mechanisms underlying these phenomena [38,45,69]. Some of these
models have also been shown to enable the calculation of personalised tumour forecasts that
can assist physicians in clinical decision-making [30, 44, 45, 63, 64].
Towards this end, these
models employ the clinical and imaging data that are regularly collected from patients according
to cancer management protocols in order to inform diagnosis, prognosis, patient triaging, and

treatment selection [30,38,44,45,50,64]. In particular, personalised tumour forecasting requires
data at several time points to initialise the model, calibrate its parameters, and then produce the
patient-specific prediction [30, 44, 45, 63, 64]. In some clinical scenarios, these longitudinal data
are available because they are currently used to assess tumour changes that correlate with clinical
endpoints of interest (e.g., progression to higher-risk disease, treatment failure, survival) [25,59].
For example, longitudinal tumour measurements are leveraged to identify progression to more
malignant stages of newly diagnosed untreated prostate cancer during active surveillance [44],
as well as to assess therapeutic response during neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer [64]
and chemoradiation of high-grade glioma [30].
Despite the increased information on tumour dynamics provided by longitudinal cancer moni-
toring, follow-up strategies may not include sufficiently frequent tests to accurately assess changes
in tumour status and inform mathematical models [10, 38, 44, 45]. Additionally, some tumours
are only diagnosed once they have developed sufficiently to produce symptoms or enable detec-
tion with standard-of-care screening methods [10,38,44,45]. In these situations, the estimation
of recent patient-specific tumour dynamics from a single dataset could provide physicians with
more accurate estimations of prognosis to guide clinical decision-making. This highly-coveted
computational capability could further contribute to reduce treatment excesses and deficiencies,
which can respectively affect the patients’ quality of life and life expectancy [26,51,70]. Despite
the inherent difficulty in estimating previous tumour dynamics from a single dataset, model-
constrained reconstruction algorithms are a viable methodology to address this computational
challenge and crucial clinical demand [5,58]. For example, following the collection of a medical
imaging measurement to characterise the tumour morphology (e.g., at diagnosis, after treat-
ment), a reconstruction algorithm based on an adequate mathematical model can identify the
tumour status at an earlier time [5,10,45,58]. The resulting reconstruction of tumour dynamics
can then be used to better estimate biomarkers of progression or therapeutic response, as well as
to locate the region of the host organ where the tumour originated. Indeed, the latter information
can have important relevance for some tumours, for instance, in the brain and the prostate [3,36].
Furthermore, the reconstruction of early tumour states is also useful in some preclinical scenarios,
for example, before the onset of experimental procedures or in sparse data collection regimens
with large changes in tumour dynamics in between consecutive measurements [38,40,67].
Here, we investigate model-constrained reconstruction algorithms informed by a single spatial
measurement (e.g., via medical imaging), and we apply them to the estimation of early stages
of newly diagnosed prostate cancer. The detection of these tumours relies on a multiparametric
magnetic resonance imaging scan, which is motivated by increasing values of the serum prostate-
specific antigen (PSA; the main blood biomarker of prostate cancer) and guides the ensuing
biopsy to confirm the disease histopathologically [44, 50]. The clinical management options for
newly diagnosed prostate cancer include active surveillance for lower-risk disease (i.e., monitoring
of indolent cases with longitudinal MRI, PSA, and biopsies until therapeutic intervention is
needed) and treatment for higher-risk tumours (e.g., surgery, radiotherapy) [50].
Therefore,
the accurate identification of the clinical risk of prostate cancer at diagnosis is fundamental to
guide the management of the disease, and reconstruction of earlier disease dynamics prior to
diagnosis can help in this crucial triaging step [5, 25, 44]. Towards this end, our reconstruction
algorithms employ a mathematical model of prostate cancer growth that relies on the phase-
field method, and that has been studied analytically and computationally in our previous works
[5,13,14]. Phase-field models constitute an established spatiotemporal continuous formulation of
the dynamics of the tumour geometry, which has also been used in the context of optimal control
problems [9,12,20–23,48]. Thus, our model relies on a continuous phase field φ, such that φ ≈0
in healthy prostatic tissue and φ ≈1 in the tumour. The tumour-healthy tissue interface exhibits
a smooth and steep profile, in which the tumour phase field rapidly varies between 0 and 1. Our
model further assumes that tumour growth is driven by a generic nutrient σ (e.g., oxygen or
glucose), whose concentration follows reaction-diffusion dynamics. Moreover, another reaction-
diffusion equation describes the local dynamics of tissue PSA p, which represents the PSA leaked

to the bloodstream per unit volume of prostatic tissue [48].
More specifically, the problem we want to address is a backward inverse problem for a nonlin-
ear system of parabolic equations. Following the notation used in [5], we call R : (φ0, σ0, p0) 7→
(φ(T), σ(T), p(T)) the nonlinear solution operator which associates to any initial data (φ0, σ0, p0)
the value of the solution at the final time (φ(T), σ(T), p(T)).
Then, given some measure-
ments (φmeas, σmeas, pmeas), we can formulate our inverse problem as that of finding initial data
(φ0, σ0, p0) such that the solution (φ, σ, p) to our model satisfies φ(T) = φmeas, σ(T) = σmeas
and p(T) = pmeas. For our theoretical discussion, we consider measurements of all three vari-
ables φmeas, σmeas and pmeas at the terminal time. However, in our simulations, we focus only
on φmeas as a specific case where the datum comes from the MRI at diagnosis. This would be
the most common use of this procedure in a practical scenario. We mention that, even in the
linear case, backward inverse problems of this kind, are well-known to be severely ill-posed, with
very weak conditional logarithmic stability from the data, see for example [28, 32, 39, 53]. As
such, while being interesting problems to study, due to the underlying ill-posedness, in the con-
text of tumour growth models the literature on backward inverse problems of this kind is quite
lacking. We mention for instance [34], where the authors also use a similar Landweber-type
method to recover the initial datum in a Fisher–Kolmogorov model for brain tumour growth.
Albeit getting some good reconstruction results in 3D, the authors do not address the analyt-
ical questions related to the inverse problem, as was done in [5], even if the model is simpler.
Another approach is followed in [57, 58], where the authors still consider a Fisher–Kolmogorov
model (with some additional couplings) and regularise the unknown initial data by assuming it is
representable by a sum of Gaussians centred in some points belonging to a lattice. They further
use a Tikhonov-like regularisation approach, by additionally enforcing sparsity, to reconstruct
not only the initial datum but also some model coefficients. With our contributions, we aim to
show that a good reconstruction can be guaranteed both theoretically and numerically without
assuming restrictive hypotheses on the initial data, even for more complex models.
As a preliminary step, it is of paramount importance to regularise the problem, by establishing
physically relevant a priori assumptions on the unknown initial data that lead to better, possibly
Lipschitz, dependence of the initial data on the measurements. Following similar ideas, in [5] the
authors applied this procedure to the above-introduced inverse problem, proving a quantitative
Lipschitz stability estimate for the reconstruction of the initial data. Starting from these results,
we now propose an iterative algorithm to solve the identification problem numerically. Such
reconstruction algorithm is based on the Landweber iteration scheme, a widely used method in
approximating and regularising solutions to inverse problems [18,27,37]. It is well-known that,
when good stability estimates are available, this kind of iterative scheme is locally convergent
and acts as a regularisation method in the presence of noise on the measurements [37]. Indeed, in
our case, we are able to prove local convergence of the Landweber algorithm (Theorem 4.5) both
with a constant step size and an adaptive one, based on the steepest descent. However, since the
problem is ill-posed and all stability constants depend exponentially on the final time, such step
size choices do not work well enough if T is too large. In such scenarios, we employ a different step
size recently introduced in [49], which, despite lacking a comprehensive theoretical guarantee, has
proven to be surprisingly accurate in the reconstruction. Hence, by using the Landweber scheme
with this new choice of the step size, we are even able to get good reconstruction results when the
terminal time T reaches one year within a low number of iterations. Under this setup, we conduct
various numerical experiments to validate the analytical results and explore the behaviour of the
reconstruction algorithm.
For the numerical discretisation, we employ Isogeometric Analysis
(IGA) in space [16] and the generalised α-method in time [11]. We then implement the above-
mentioned Landweber scheme with different step-size choices, depending on the chosen time
horizon. All our experiments are conducted considering a tumour growing in a square tissue patch
and using synthetic ground truth data generated by the forward phase-field model. In particular,
we focus only on the reconstruction of the tumour variable, even though reconstructions of the
other variables are also possible within our framework. Through our simulation study, we show
4
Beretta – Cavaterra – Fornoni – Lorenzo – Rocca
that, if T is relatively small (i.e., less than a month), the Landweber scheme with the steepest
descent adaptive step size produces high-quality reconstructions and matches the theoretical
results on the order of convergence. Noticing that the number of iterations quickly rises if T
grows larger, we switched to the adaptive step size introduced in [49] to conduct experiments for
longer time horizons (e.g., several months to a year). Thus, by applying some additional care in
the selection of the initial guess, we also were able to get good reconstructions even in this much
more challenging case. Moreover, we additionally assessed the performance of our algorithms in
the presence of Gaussian noise on the terminal data, getting faithful reconstructions also in this
case.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we thoroughly introduce our mathematical
model, by referring to [13]. Section 3 is devoted to the recollection of the theoretical results
obtained in [5] on the analysis of the inverse problem. Section 4 addresses the problem of the
approximation of the solution through the use of a Landweber iteration scheme, by also proving
some rigorous results on its convergence properties. In Section 5 we present our computational
methods and, then, in Section 6 we show and comment on some representative simulations.
Finally, in Section 7 we discuss our results, possible limitations, and future research directions.

Mathematical model
We leverage the phase-field model of prostate cancer growth that was presented and analysed
in Refs. [5, 13, 14].
The interested reader is referred to these previous works for a detailed
presentation of the biological phenomena included in the model. The only difference with respect
to the original formulation in [13] is that we have eliminated the terms describing cytotoxic and
antiangiogenic treatment effects. The rationale for this modification is that here we are interested
in reconstructing early stages of prostate cancer growth before diagnosis and, thus, before the
onset of treatments. In the following, we briefly present the main equations of the model and
outline their components.
Let Ω⊂RN, N = 2, 3, be an open and bounded domain with
C2 boundary and outward unit normal vector n. Let T > 0 be a time horizon, and denote
Qt := Ω× (0, t) and Σt = ∂Ω× (0, t) for any t ∈(0, T]. Then, the prostate cancer model can be
formulated as
∂tφ = λ∆φ −F ′(φ) + m(σ)h′(φ)
in QT ,
(2.1)
∂tσ = η∆σ + Sh(1 −φ) + Scφ −(γh(1 −φ) + γcφ) σ
in QT ,
(2.2)
∂tp = D∆p + αh(1 −φ) + αcφ −γpp
in QT ,
(2.3)
φ = 0,
∂nσ = 0,
∂np = 0
on ΣT ,
(2.4)
φ(0, x) = φ0,
σ(0, x) = σ0,
p(0, x) = p0
in Ω.
(2.5)
The differential operators in these equations are defined as follows: the subscript t denotes partial
differentiation with respect to time, ∆is the Laplace operator with respect to the space variables,
F ′ denotes the derivative of F, and the subscript n indicates the outward normal derivative to
the domain boundary ∂Ω.
In Eqs. (2.1)-(2.5), φ is a phase field that identifies the spatial regions occupied by healthy
tissue (φ ≈0) and the tumour (φ ≈1). In the context of cancer phase-field models, λ = Mℓ2
is the tumour cell diffusion coefficient, F(φ) = Mφ2(1 −φ)2 is a regular double-well potential,
h(φ) = Mφ2(3 −2φ) is an interpolation function, M is a positive constant associated with
tumour cell mobility, and ℓis a positive constant denoting the interface length scale [61, 66].
Additionally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the tumour phase field in Eq. (2.1) is driven by
a nutrient field σ via the tilting function m(σ), which represents net tumour cell proliferation.
This function is defined as
m(σ) = mref

,
(2.6)

where mref, ρ, and A are constants that respectively represent a positive scaling factor and two
non-dimensional indices associated with tumour cell proliferation and death. We further define
ρ = Kρ
Kρ and A = −KA
KA , where Kρ and KA are the tumour cell proliferation and death rates while
Kρ and KA are their corresponding scaling reference values. The constants Kρ, Kρ, KA, and KA
are all positive. Moreover, in Eq. (2.6), the positive constants σl and σr denote a reference and a
threshold value for the nutrient concentration in describing the dependence of the proliferation
activity of the tumour on the nutrient availability.
The nutrient follows reaction-diffusion dynamics according to Eq. (2.2), where η denotes the
nutrient diffusivity. The first two reaction terms in the right-hand side of Eq. (2.2) represent the
nutrient supply to healthy and cancerous tissue governed by the rates Sh and Sc. Similarly, the
last two reaction terms in this equation model nutrient consumption in healthy and cancerous
tissue mediated by the rates γh and γc. In Eq. (2.3), we also choose reaction-diffusion dynamics
for the tissue PSA p [48]. The tissue PSA diffusivity is denoted by D. The first two reaction terms
in the right-hand side of Eq. (2.3) describe the production of tissue PSA in healthy and cancerous
tissue at rates αh and αc, respectively. The last reaction term in this equation represents the
natural decay of tissue PSA with rate γp. Hence, to recover the serum PSA value Ps used in
clinical practice, it suffices to integrate the tissue PSA over the spatial domain (i.e., Ps =
R
Ωp dx).
Of note, all the parameters in Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) are positive and constant in this work.
Furthermore, for simplicity of exposition, we sometimes adopt the compact notation
γch := γc −γh,
Sch := Sc −Sh,
αch := αc −αh.
Finally, Eqs. (2.4) define the boundary conditions and Eqs. (2.5) provide the initial conditions
of the model. In particular, we choose no-flux boundary conditions for the nutrient and the
tissue PSA, while we define zero-valued Dirichlet boundary conditions for the tumour phase
field. Hence, we assume that the tumour is confined within the domain, which aligns with the
organ-confined stage of the majority of newly-diagnosed prostate cancer cases [50]. Additionally,
the functions φ0, σ0, and p0 are spatial maps at t = 0.

Analytical results
We first define the following spaces:
H = L2(Ω),
V0 = H1
0(Ω),
V ∗
0 = (H1
0(Ω))∗,
V = H1(Ω),
V ∗= (H1(Ω))∗,
W0 = H2(Ω) ∩H1
0(Ω),
W =

u ∈H2(Ω) | ∂nu = 0
	
.
By standard results, we know that, if H is identified with its dual, the following compact and
dense embeddings hold:
W0 ,→V0 ,→H ,→V ∗
0
and
W ,→V ,→H ,→V ∗.
Additionally, we recall that, by elliptic regularity, we can use the equivalent norms:
∥u∥2
W0 := ∥u∥2
H + ∥∆u∥2
H,
∥u∥2
W := ∥u∥2
H + ∥∆u∥2
H.
We further define the following spaces:
H = H × H × H,
V = V0 × V × V.
Regarding the parameters of the system, we assume the following hypotheses:
A1. λ, η, γh, γc, Sh, Sc, D, γp, αh, αc > 0.
A2. F(s) = Ms2(1 −s)2 and h(s) = Ms2(3 −2s), with M > 0, for any s ∈R. In particular,
we observe that F, h ∈C∞(R).

, with mref, ρ, A, σl, σr > 0.
In particular, we
observe that m and m′ are Lipschitz continuous on R and m, m′, m′′ ∈L∞(Ω).
In what follows, we use the symbol C > 0, which may also change from line to line, to denote
positive constants depending only on the fixed parameters of the system. In some cases, we will
use a subscript to highlight some particular dependence of these constants.
In this section, we briefly recall the main analytical results proved in [5].
We refer the
interested reader to the cited article for a more detailed exposition, as well as the proofs of the
corresponding results. We first introduce the set of admissible initial data as follows:
Iad =

(φ0, σ0, p0) ∈V | 0 ≤φ0 ≤1, 0 ≤σ0 ≤σmax,
0 ≤p0 ≤pmax and ∥(φ0, σ0, p0)∥V ≤C
	
,
(3.1)
where σmax, pmax ∈L∞(Ω) and C > 0 are given. Note that Iad is a closed and convex subset of
V∩L∞(Ω)3. Next, we consider the forward operator R : Iad →H which associates to any initial
data (φ0, σ0, p0) ∈Iad the corresponding solution (φ(T), σ(T), p(T)) to (2.1)–(2.5), evaluated at
the final time, that is
R : Iad →H,
R((φ0, σ0, p0)) = (φ(T), σ(T), p(T)).
(3.2)
By [13, Theorem 3.2] and [5, Proposition 2.3], we know that the forward map R is well-defined
and Lipschitz continuous.
Moreover, by [5, Theorem 2.5], R is also continuously Fréchet differentiable in an open subset
IR of V ∩L∞(Ω)3, containing Iad. In particular, its derivative can be fully characterised in the
following way. Indeed, we introduce the linearised system:
∂tY −λ∆Y + F ′′(φ)Y −m(σ)h′′(φ)Y −m′(σ)h′(φ)Z = 0
in QT ,
(3.3)
∂tZ −η∆Z + γhZ + (γc −γh)(σY + φZ) −(Sc −Sh)Y = 0
in QT ,
(3.4)
∂tP −D∆P + γpP = (αc −αh)Y
in QT ,
(3.5)
Y = 0,
∂nZ = ∂nP = 0
on ΣT ,
(3.6)
Y (0) = h,
Z(0) = k,
P(0) = w
in Ω,
(3.7)
where h, k, w ∈L2(Ω). It is shown in [5, Proposition 2.4] that the linearised system (3.3)–(3.7)
is well-posed, both in terms of weak and strong solutions.
Then, we can write the explicit expression of the Fréchet derivative of the operator R as follows:
DR(φ0, σ0, p0)[(h, k, w)] = (Y (T), Z(T), P(T)).
(3.8)
We stress that R being of class C1 means that the Fréchet derivative DR is Lipschitz continuous
as a function from IR to the space L(V ∩L∞(Ω)3, H). More precisely, the following estimate
holds:
∥DR((φ1
0, σ1
0, p1
0)) −DR((φ2
0, σ2
0, p2
0))∥2
L(V∩L∞(Ω)3,H) ≤C0∥(φ1
0, σ1
0, p1
0) −(φ2
0, σ2
0, p2
0)∥2
H,
(3.9)
for some constant C0 > 0 depending only on the parameters of the system.
The above regularity of the forward map opens the possibility to rigorously address the
inverse problem of reconstructing the initial data, given a measurement at the final time. Indeed,
through a logarithmic convexity approach, in [5] the authors proved two key stability results for
the inverse problem, which we recall below. Call M > 0 and M1 > 0 the minimal constants such
that
∥(φ, σ, p)∥C0([0,T];H) ≤M
and
∥(φ, σ, p)∥H1(0,T;H) ≤M1
(3.10)
uniformly for (φ0, σ0, p0) ∈Iad. We recall that such estimates hold due to the well-posedness
results in [13, Theorem 3.2]. Then, we have the following result.

Theorem 3.1. Assume hypotheses A1–A3. Let (φ1, σ1, p1) and (φ2, σ2, p2) be two solutions of

0, σi
0, pi
0) ∈Iad for i = 1, 2. Let M > 0,
M1 > 0 be as above. Moreover, let

where C1 = C1(T) > 0 is the constant appearing in the Hölder stability estimate of [5, Proposition
3.1]. Then, there exists a constant C2 > 0 such that

where γ > 0 is a constant depending only on the parameters of the system, but not on T.
Proof. See [5, Theorem 3.5 and Proposition 3.1].
We observe that this type of logarithmic estimate (3.11) can be impractical in applications, as
the error actually gets small only if the final data are very close to each other. Moreover, it
can be easily seen that the stability constant C2 deteriorates exponentially with the final time
T, making this stability estimate even more unreliable. Nevertheless, this is expected since we
are dealing with a backward problem for a parabolic system, which is known to be severely
ill-posed as T gets larger. However, in view of numerical applications, it is important to prove
quantitative Lipschitz stability estimates, possibly under additional a priori hypotheses on the
initial data. Indeed, this was achieved as the main result of [5], by assuming to be reconstructing
initial data lying in a finite-dimensional subspace of V, for instance, one of the discrete spaces
used in numerical approximations. We recall such a theorem below.
Theorem 3.2. Assume hypotheses A1–A3. Let Λ be a finite-dimensional subspace of V and
K ⊆Λ be a compact subset. Assume further that
(φ0, σ0, p0) ∈K ∩Iad.
Then, there exists a constant Cs > 0 such that for any choice of (φ1

where C0 is the Lipschitz constant of the Fréchet-derivative, given by (3.9), L > 0 is a uniform
bound on the solutions to the linearised system and Q2 > 0 is the logarithmic stability constant
for the linearised system (see [5, Theorem 3.8]).
8
Beretta – Cavaterra – Fornoni – Lorenzo – Rocca
Proof. See [5, Theorem 3.10].
We finally point out that the constant Cs blows up exponentially as the dimension of Λ goes to
infinity. Indeed, Cs has a direct exponential proportionality to the constant CΛ, which is finite
only if Λ has a finite dimension and blows up as it becomes higher. Additionally, one can also
notice that the dependence of Cs on the final time is even worse, namely Cs depends doubly
exponentially on T. This means that, even if we have some kind of Lipschitz stability, we have
to be very careful when designing numerical algorithms to approximate the solution.

Landweber iteration scheme
Given a measurement (φmeas, σmeas, pmeas) ∈H at the final time, assuming the existence of a
(unique) initial configuration (φ0, σ0, p0), we now address the problem of approximating this
solution. By Theorem 3.2, we know that we have a Lipschitz stability estimate if we restrict the
initial data in
K = {u ∈Λ | ∥u∥V ≤C},
(4.1)
where Λ is a finite-dimensional subspace of V. Therefore, it makes sense to consider the minimi-
sation problem:
arg min
(φ0,σ0,p0)∈K∩Iad
J ((φ0, σ0, p0))
=
arg min
(φ0,σ0,p0)∈K∩Iad
κ1
2 ∥φ(T) −φmeas∥2
H + κ2
2 ∥σ(T) −σmeas∥2
H + κ3
2 ∥p(T) −pmeas∥2
H,
(4.2)
where (φ(T), σ(T), p(T)) = R((φ0, σ0, p0)) is the solution to (2.1)–(2.5), evaluated at the time T.
Here κ1, κ2, κ3 are positive parameters that can be chosen depending on which target is the most
interesting in experiments and on the relative order of magnitude of the variables. Clearly, since
K ∩Iad is compact and J is continuous, (4.2) admits at least a solution in K ∩Iad. Moreover,
if a (unique) solution to the inverse problem exists in K ∩Iad, then it trivially minimises J .
We recall that the finite-dimensional set K can be chosen for instance as a closed and bounded
subset of a discrete space used for numerical methods, therefore what we propose can be easily
implemented.
Remark 4.1. From a practical point of view, it could not be entirely feasible to have a pointwise
value for the PSA concentration p, even if some ideas are given in [48]. Thus, a better term in
the minimisation functional could be κ3
 R
Ωp dx −Pmeas

, where Pmeas would be the global
measured PSA level, which is what can be usually measured in practice. Of course, one can also
consider this kind of term from a theoretical point of view and see that the minimisation of such
a functional would lead to some optimality conditions that can then be discretised (cf. [14]).
However, the corresponding iterative approximation method would not fit in the Landweber
framework any longer. Hence, we would not have at our disposal all the theoretical guarantees
that are shown below for the Landweber scheme.
For this reason, we stick to the proposed
functional J , also because in practice (cf. Sections 5 and 6) we put κ2 = κ3 = 0, as the most
important datum to reconstruct is the tumour phase field.
As previously anticipated, to find such a solution, we use a Landweber iteration method,
which is a common technique to approximate solutions to inverse problems.
A similar idea
was used for a simpler model of tumour growth in [34]. Indeed, starting from an initial guess
(φ0
0, σ0
0, p0
0) ∈K ∩Iad, we approximate the solution (φ0, σ0, p0) by using a gradient descent
algorithm of the following form:
ψj+1
0
= ψj
0 −µDR(ψj
0)∗[κ · (R(ψj
0) −ψmeas)],
(4.3)
Reconstructing early states of prostate cancer

where we used the compact notation ψj
0 = (φj
0, σj
0, pj
0), ψmeas = (φmeas, σmeas, pmeas), κ =
(κ1, κ2, κ3) and DR(·)∗[·] is the adjoint operator of the Fréchet-derivative of R. The parameter
µ, instead, is a step size that has to be chosen suitably.
In our case, it is easy to find the
adjoint system associated with the minimisation problem (4.2), for instance by using the formal
Lagrangian method. Indeed, by also looking at [14], the adjoint system associated to a generic
state ( ˜φ, ˜σ, ˜p) is:
−∂tq −λ∆q + F ′′( ˜φ)q −m(˜σ)h′′( ˜φ)q
+ (γc −γh)˜σz −(Sc −Sh)z −(αc −αh)r = 0
in QT ,
(4.4)
−∂tz −η∆z + γhz + (γc −γh) ˜φz −m′(˜σ)h′( ˜φ)q = 0
in QT ,
(4.5)
−∂tr −D∆r + γpr = 0
in QT ,
(4.6)
q = 0,
∂nz = ∂nr = 0
in ΣT ,
(4.7)
q(T) = κ1( ˜φ(T) −φmeas), z(T) = κ2(˜σ(T) −σmeas),
r(T) = κ3(˜p(T) −pmeas)
in Ω,
(4.8)
therefore we can say that
DR∗(ψj
0)[κ · (R(ψj
0) −ψmeas)] = (qj(0), zj(0), rj(0)),
where (qj, zj, rj) is the solution to the adjoint system (4.4)–(4.8) with ( ˜φ, ˜σ, ˜p) solution corre-
sponding to the initial data (φj
0, σj
0, pj
0). Regarding the well-posedness of the adjoint system, we
can state the following result.
Proposition 4.2. Assume hypotheses A1–A3 and let (φmeas, σmeas, pmeas) ∈H. Assume further
that ( ˜φ0, ˜σ0, ˜p0) ∈Iad and that ( ˜φ, ˜σ, ˜p) is the corresponding solution of (2.1)–(2.5). Then, (4.4)–
(4.8) admits a unique weak solution (q, z, r) ∈H1(0, T; V∗) ∩C0([0, T]; H) ∩L2(0, T; V), which
solves the system in variational formulation and satisfies the estimate:
∥(q, z, r)∥2

2∥˜σ(T) −σmeas∥2
H + κ2
3∥˜p(T) −pmeas∥2
H

,
with C > 0 depending only on the parameters of the system.
Proof. Using the transformation t 7→T −t, we can rewrite (4.4)–(4.8) as a linear parabolic
system with initial conditions in H, coefficients in L∞(QT ) (due to [13, Theorem 3.2]) and
without sources. Therefore, we can apply standard results on the existence of weak solutions of
linear parabolic systems to deduce the thesis.
We now establish convergence for the Landweber method and quantify its convergence rate, by
using a general result proved in [18, Theorem 3.2], which we recall below.
Lemma 4.3. Let X and Y be two Hilbert spaces and G : D(G) ⊆X →Y be a continuous and
locally Fréchet-differentiable operator. Let y ∈Y and assume that there exists x ∈D(G) such
that G(x) = y. Consider the Landweber iteration scheme
xj+1 = xj −µDG(xj)∗(G(xj) −y),
with starting point x0. Let ρ > 0 and assume that x ∈Bρ(x0) and B = Bρ′(x0) ⊆D(G) for some
ρ′ > ρ. Moreover, let the following conditions be satisfied:
(i) The Fréchet-derivative DG of G is Lipschitz continuous locally in B, i.e.
∥DG(x) −DG(˜x)∥L(X,Y ) ≤L∥x −˜x∥X
∀x, ˜x ∈B.
(ii) G is weakly sequentially closed.
10
Beretta – Cavaterra – Fornoni – Lorenzo – Rocca
(iii) The inversion has a uniform Lipschitz-type stability, i.e. there exists CG such that
∥x −˜x∥X ≤CG∥G(x) −G(˜x)∥Y
∀x, ˜x ∈B.
(iv) There exists ˆL > 0 such that ∥DG(x)∥L(X,Y ) ≤ˆL for any x ∈B.
(v) The step-size µ is such that
µ < 1
ˆL2
and
µ(1 −µˆL2) < 2C2
G.
Then, if
ρ = (2LˆLC2
G)−2
and
∥x0 −x∥2
X ≤ρ,
the iterates satisfy
∥xj −x∥2
X ≤ρ
∀xj ∈N
and
xj →x in X as j →+∞.
Moreover, if
c = 1
2µ(1 −µˆL2)C−2
G ,
0 < c < 1,
the convergence rate is given by
∥xj −x∥2
X ≤ρ(1 −c)j.
(4.9)
Remark 4.4. Observe that (4.9) means that at every step the error ∥xj −x∥X gets reduced by a
factor √1 −c. Then, the order of convergence of the Landweber scheme as an iterative method
is at most linear.
We can now apply Lemma 4.3 to our case, to prove convergence of the Landweber iteration (4.3).
This should guarantee a fine numerical reconstruction of the initial distribution of the tumour,
as long as the initial guess is chosen close enough to the actual solution.
Theorem 4.5. Assume hypotheses A1–A3. Assume also that there exists ψ0 ∈K ∩Iad such
that R(ψ0) = ψmeas. Then, there exist ρ > 0, 0 < c < 1 and µ∗> 0, which depend only on the
parameters of the system and can be determined as in Lemma 4.3, such that if ψ0
0 ∈H, κ ∈R3
and µ > 0 are chosen such that
∥ψ0
0 −ψ0∥2
H ≤ρ
and
µ|κ| < µ∗,
then the iterates {ψj
0}j∈N of (4.3) satisfy
∥ψj
0 −ψ0∥2
H ≤ρ(1 −c)j for any j ∈N and ψj
0 →ψ0 as j →+∞.
Proof. We just need to apply Lemma 4.3 with X = Λ, Y = H and G = R. Indeed, hypothesis
(i) on Lipschitz-continuity of the Fréchet-derivative DR is verified even globally by the Fréchet-
differentiability result in [5, Theorem 2.5]. Then, condition (ii) on weak sequential closedness
follows immediately by the well-posedness result in [13, Theorem 3.2], which implies continuity
of R, and by the fact that Λ is finite-dimensional, so weak and strong topologies coincide.
Moreover, hypothesis (iii) is exactly Theorem 3.2, giving Lipschitz stability of the inverse map,
and condition (iv) follows easily by [5, Proposition 2.4] on well-posedness of the linearised system.
Regarding the correspondence of the constants appearing in Lemma 4.3, we have that in our case
L = C0 given by (3.9), CG = Cs given by (3.12) and ˆL is related to the well-posedness of the
linearised system (3.3)–(3.7). In particular, ˆL should be such that
∥DR(φ0, σ0, p0)∥L(Λ,H) =
sup
∥(h,k,w)∥H=1
∥(Y (T), Z(T), P(T))∥H ≤ˆL,
Reconstructing early states of prostate cancer
11
for any choice of (φ0, σ0, p0) ∈Λ. Additionally, we recall that, in our formulation (4.3) of the
algorithm, we also added the weights κ, which can be also factored out of the adjoint operator,
since it is linear. This means that we actually have to impose a smallness condition like (v)
above on µ|κ|, i.e.
µ|κ| < 1
ˆL2
and
µ|κ|(1 −µ|κ|ˆL2) < 2C2
s.
Then µ∗can be deduced by the previous inequalities and we can define
ρ = (2C0 ˆLC2
s)−2
and
c = 1
2µ|κ|(1 −µ|κ|ˆL2)C−2
s .
Therefore Lemma 4.3 can be applied, and the proof is concluded.
Remark 4.6. Observe that, by Theorem 4.5, the scheme (4.3) converges if the initial guess ψ0
0
is chosen such that ∥ψ0
0 −ψ0∥2
H < ρ. However, theoretically, the Lipschitz stability estimate
(3.12) gives us an explicit condition to choose our starting guess. Indeed, by Theorem 3.2, we
know that, if we assume ψ0 ∈K ∩Iad, we can expect that
∥ψ0
0 −ψ0∥H ≤Cs∥R(ψ0
0) −ψmeas∥H,
where the term on the right-hand side is explicitely computable in practice. Then, with a similar
reasoning as in [2, Lemma 2], we just need to find ψ0
0 ∈K such that
∥R(ψ0
0) −ψmeas∥H ≤
√ρ
Cs
.
(4.10)
This would immediately imply that ∥ψ0
0 −ψ0∥2
H < ρ.
Since K is compact, (4.10) can be
guaranteed for example by covering K with a fine enough finite lattice or by random sampling
until one finds a starting point close enough. Clearly, this is not efficient and often unpractical
when working with high-dimensional discretisations and long final times T, since, by its definition,
the bound in (4.10) decays at least exponentially with both dimension and final time. Due to
these reasons, for our experiments in Section 6, we choose the initial guess through physical
considerations.
While being an interesting result in theory, Theorem 4.5 requires highly restrictive hypotheses
to be verified in practice. In particular, the convergence radius ρ becomes almost immediately
too small when increasing the final time or the dimension of the discrete spaces. Moreover, the
bound on the constant step-size µ is not easily computable. To overcome these issues, one usually
tries to set up an adaptive choice of the step-size, thus considering algorithms of the form:
ψj+1
0
= ψj
0 −µjDR(ψj
0)∗[κ · (R(ψj
0) −ψmeas)].
(4.11)
There are many possible choices of the adaptive step-size, due to the extensive literature on
general gradient descent methods. One of the most commonly used is the steepest descent, which
essentially amounts to choosing the step that gives the biggest reduction along the direction of
the gradient. Following [37, Section 3.4], in case of our Landweber iteration this choice becomes
µj|κ| =
∥DR(ψj
0)∗[κ · (R(ψj
0) −ψmeas)]∥2
H
∥DR(ψj
0)[DR(ψj
0)∗[κ · (R(ψj
0) −ψmeas)]]∥2
H
=
∥(qj(0), zj(0), rj(0))∥2
H
∥(Y j(T), Zj(T), P j(T))∥2
H
,
(4.12)
where (qj, zj, rj) is the solution to the adjoint system (4.4)–(4.8) with ( ˜φ, ˜σ, ˜p) = (φj, σj, pj)
solution corresponding to the initial data (φj
0, σj
0, pj
0) as before, and (Y, Z, P) is the solution to
12
Beretta – Cavaterra – Fornoni – Lorenzo – Rocca
the linearised system (3.3)–(3.7) with initial data (h, k, w) = (qj(0), zj(0), rj(0)) and (φ, σ, p) =
(φj, σj, pj) solution corresponding to the initial data (φj
0, σj
0, pj
0), namely
∂tY −λ∆Y + F ′′(φj)Y −m(σj)h′′(φj)Y −m′(σj)h′(φj)Z = 0
in QT ,
∂tZ −η∆Z + γhZ + (γc −γh)(σjY + φjZ) −(Sc −Sh)Y = 0
in QT ,
∂tP −D∆P + γpP = (αc −αh)Y
in QT ,
Y = 0,
∂nZ = ∂nP = 0
on ΣT ,
Y (0) = qj(0),
Z(0) = zj(0),
P(0) = rj(0)
in Ω.
It is shown in [37, Theorems 3.21 and 3.22] that this method converges to the exact solution
(φ0, σ0, p0), under the validity of the tangential cone condition on R and the choice of a suitable
stopping criterion for the number of iterations, via a discrepancy principle.
For the sake of
completeness, we recall that the operator R satisfies the tangential cone condition if there exist
r > 0 and η < 1
2 such that
∥R(ψ0) −R(eψ0) −DR(ψ0)[ψ0 −eψ0]∥H ≤η∥R(ψ0) −R(eψ0)∥H
∀ψ0, eψ0 ∈B2r(ψ0
0). (4.13)
In our case, since R is Fréchet-differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous derivative and the
stability estimate (3.12) holds, it is easy to see that this local condition holds.
Indeed, by
straight-forward computations, it follows that
∥R(ψ0) −R(eψ0) −DR(ψ0)[ψ0 −eψ0]∥H ≤C0∥ψ0 −eψ0∥2
H
= C0∥ψ0 −eψ0∥H∥ψ0 −eψ0∥H ≤C0Cs4r ∥R(ψ0) −R(eψ0)∥H,
where η = C0Cs4r <
1
2, if r > 0 is small enough.
As said above (cf. [37]), this condition
guarantees local convergence of the adaptive Landweber method (4.11). We further comment
that the Landweber method, both with the fixed step size and the steepest descent version, is
known to be a reliable regularisation method in the presence of noisy data (cf. [37]). Indeed,
if paired with a suitable stopping rule for the number of iterations, the method reconstructs
a regularised version of the initial data and converges to the exact solution if the noise level
goes to zero. The reason why the number of iterations has to be stopped accordingly in the
presence of noise is to avoid the amplification of errors, as the Landweber scheme shows a typical
semi-convergence behaviour. This will be clearer by looking at the simulation results in Section
6.
However, due to its slow convergence, the proposed Landweber schemes may still be not
enough to have convergence when the final time T is too large, since all the stability constants
blow up exponentially. For this reason, when doing numerical simulations, we are forced to adopt
more efficient adaptive step-size choices than those mentioned above. The literature on methods
for accelerating Landweber iterations or, more in general, gradient descent schemes is definitely
vast, we cite for example [4,19,31,52] and references therein. In particular, upon many trial and
error procedures, we especially mention [49], since the method proposed there proved particularly
useful to our situation. Indeed, they propose a new choice of the adaptive step size for a general
gradient descent method and they show its convergence, both theoretically and numerically, for
a convex function in Rn with locally Lipschitz gradient. Their proposed choice for the step size
is particularly easy to implement and in our case takes the following form
µj|κ| = min
(p
1 + θj−1 µj−1|κ|,
∥ψj
0 −ψj−1
0
∥H
2∥((qj −qj−1)(0), (zj −zj−1)(0), (rj −rj−1)(0))∥H
)
,
where θj =
µj
µj−1 for any j ∈N and µ0 > 0, θ0 = +∞are given as inputs.
(4.14)
Heuristically, the first term inside the minimum assures that some kind of discrete Lyapunov
energy associated to the scheme keeps decreasing, while the second one is an approximation of
Reconstructing early states of prostate cancer
13
the reciprocal of the Lipschitz constant of the descent direction. Despite the lack of analysis
in infinite-dimensional spaces with non-convex operators, this method still proved powerful in
tackling our problem. More details will be given when speaking about numerical results in the
next sections. To distinguish the two proposed variants of the choice of the adaptive step size,
in what follows we will denote (4.11) with the steepest descent choice (4.12) as the Landweber
scheme and (4.11) with the second choice (4.14) as the Adaptive Gradient Descent scheme. Keep
in mind, however, that both schemes fit into the Landweber framework, even if we call them
differently.

Numerical methods
5.1
Spatial discretisation
We use Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) to discretise in space the forward, linearised, and adjoint
problems. IGA is a recent, rapidly-growing technique that can be regarded as a generalisation of
the classical Finite Element Method [16]. In particular, we use a standard isogeometric Bubnov-
Galerkin method based on a C1-continuous quadratic B-spline space (see Ref. [16] for further
detail). Hence, our spatial discretisation requires the definition of the weak forms of the forward,
linearised, and adjoint problems. Let us first consider the forward problem in Eqs. (2.1)-(2.3),
whose weak form can be written as: find φ ∈V0, σ ∈V , and p ∈V such that
Bχ
1 (χ1, φ, σ, p) = 0

We also introduce the weak form of the linearised problem defined by Eqs. (3.3)-(3.5), which is
stated as: find Y ∈V0, Z ∈V , and P ∈V such that
Bζ
1(ζ1, Y, Z, P) = 0

Likewise, we express the weak form of the adjoint problem given by Eqs. (4.4)-(4.6) as follows:
find q ∈V0, z ∈V , and r ∈V such that
Bψ
1 (ψ1, q, z, r) = 0

(5.18)
The spatial discretisation of the weak forms defined above further relies on defining finite-
dimensional spaces V h ⊂V and V h
0 ⊂V0. We construct these discrete spaces leveraging the
aforementioned C1-continuous quadratic B-spline space [16]. For example, the space V h can be
defined in terms of a spline basis as V h = span {NA(x)}A=1,...,nf , where nf is the number of
basis functions (i.e., nf = dim(V h)) and NA(x) represents each multivariate spline basis func-
tion. We also utilise the superscript h to denote finite-dimensional approximations to the exact
solution of the forward, linearised, and adjoint problems. For instance, the finite-dimensional
approximation to the tumour phase field is given by φh(t, x) = Pnf
A=1 φA(t)NA(x), where the
time-dependent coefficients φA(t) are called control variables. The functions σh, ph, Y h, Zh, P h,
qh, zh, and rh are defined analogously. Importantly, the functions that belong to V h
0 will have
some control variables constrained to ensure that the Dirichlet boundary conditions are satisfied.
Furthermore, the Neumann boundary conditions that are relevant to the forward, linearised, and
adjoint problems are naturally enforced within the weak form. We finally mention that the space
Vh := V h
0 × V h × V h can then be considered as an example of the finite-dimensional subspace
Λ ⊆V in Theorem 3.2. Actually, in the following, we will tacitly assume Λ = Vh.
5.2
Time discretisation
We use the generalized-α method to integrate in time [11,16,33]. This method is applied to the
spatially-discretised version of the weak forms of the forward, linearised, and adjoint problems
introduced in Section 5.1.
Let us first consider the forward problem.
We define φ as the
global vector of control variables associated with the unknown field φh, i.e., φ = {φA}A=1,...,nf .
Similarly, we further define the vectors σ = {σA}A=1,...,nf and p = {pA}A=1,...,nf . We can now
introduce the residual vector of the forward problem as
ResF = {Rφ, Rσ, Rp}
(5.19)
where Rφ = {Rφ
A}A=1,...,nf , Rσ = {Rσ
A}A=1,...,nf , and Rp = {Rp
A}A=1,...,nf , such that

Let us further define U n = {φn, σn, pn} as the time-discrete approximation to the control
variables of the forward problem at time tn. Then, in the forward problem we calculate U n+1
Reconstructing early states of prostate cancer
15
from U n by enforcing the equation
ResF( ˙U n+αm, U n+αf ) = 0,
(5.23)
where
U n+1
= U n + (tn+1 −tn) ˙U n + γ(tn+1 −tn)( ˙U n+1 −˙U n),
(5.24)
˙U n+αm= ˙U n + αm( ˙U n+1 −˙U n),
(5.25)
U n+αf = U n + αf(U n+1 −U n).
(5.26)
In Eqs. (5.23)-(5.26), we define tn+1 −tn = ∆tn > 0 as the time step, while αm, αf and γ are
real-valued parameters that define the accuracy and stability of the time integration algorithm.
Similarly, for the linearised problem, we introduce the global vectors Y = {YA}A=1,...,nf ,
Z = {ZA}A=1,...,nf and P = {PA}A=1,...,nf corresponding to the discrete functions Y h, Zh, and
P h. We further define the residual vector for the linearised problem as
ResL = {RY , RZ, RP }
(5.27)
where RY = {RY
A}A=1,...,nf , RZ = {RZ
A}A=1,...,nf and RP = {RP
A}A=1,...,nf , such that
RY
A = Bζ

(5.28)
RZ
A = Bζ
2(NA, Y , Z, P ),
(5.29)
RP
A = Bζ
3(NA, Y , Z, P ).
(5.30)
Now, we can redefine U n = {Y n, Zn, P n} using the time-discrete approximation to the control
variables of the linearised problem at time tn.
Then, the time integration of the linearised
problem consists of calculating U n+1 from U n by requiring
ResL( ˙U n+αm, U n+αf ) = 0,
(5.31)
and using the expressions for U n+1, U n+αm, and U n+αf provided by Eqs. (5.24)-(5.26).
For the adjoint problem, we make the same initial definitions as we did for the forward and
linearised problem. Hence, we introduce the global vectors q = {qA}A=1,...,nf , z = {zA}A=1,...,nf
and r = {rA}A=1,...,nf , which correspond to the discrete functions qh, zh, and rh. Furthermore,
we define the residual vector for the adjoint problem as
ResA = {Rq, Rz, Rr}
(5.32)
where Rq = {Rq
A}A=1,...,nf , Rz = {Rz
A}A=1,...,nf , and Rr = {Rr
A}A=1,...,nf , such that
Rq
A = Bψ

A = Bψ
2 (NA, q, z, r),
(5.34)
Rr
A = Bψ
3 (NA, q, z, r).
(5.35)
Let us now redefine U n = {qn, zn, rn} using the time-discrete approximation to the control
variables of the adjoint problem at time tn. A fundamental difference of the adjoint problem
with respect to the forward and linearised problems is that the former is solved backwards in
time starting at t = T, so we need to redefine ∆tn = tn −tn+1 < 0. Then, the time integration
of the adjoint problem consists of computing U n from U n+1 by imposing
ResA( ˙U n+αm, U n+αf ) = 0,
(5.36)
16
Beretta – Cavaterra – Fornoni – Lorenzo – Rocca
where
U n
= U n+1 + (tn −tn+1) ˙U n+1 + γ(tn −tn+1)( ˙U n −˙U n+1),
(5.37)
˙U n+αm= ˙U n+1 + αm( ˙U n −˙U n+1),
(5.38)
U n+αf = U n+1 + αf(U n −U n+1).
(5.39)
Note that we have redefined U n+1, U n+αm, and U n+αf in Eqs. (5.37)-(5.39) with respect to their
former expressions used for the time integration of the forward and linearised problems provided
by Eqs. (5.24)-(5.26) in order to accommodate the backwards nature of the adjoint problem.
As shown in Ref. [33], A-stability and second-order accuracy can be obtained with the
generalized-α method if ρ∞∈[0, 1] and
αm = 1

(5.40)
All the simulations presented in this work were carried out by using ρ∞= 1/2 and leveraging
the definitions provided in Eq. (5.40). Additionally, we used the Newton-Raphson method [16]
to solve the algebraic systems given by Eqs. (5.23)-(5.26) for the forward problem, Eqs. (5.31)
and (5.24)-(5.26) for the linearised problem, and Eqs. (5.36)-(5.39) for the adjoint problem.
For each problem, the convergence criterion to advance from one time step to the next one
consists of reducing the individual residuals to εNR of its initial value (i.e., Rφ, Rσ, and Rp
for the forward problem; RY , RZ, and RP for the linearised problem; and Rq, Rz, and Rr for
the adjoint problem). Then, the linear systems that result after the application of the Newton-
Raphson method are solved using GMRES [54] with a diagonal preconditioner up to a predefined
tolerance εGMRES or a maximum number of iterations.
5.3
Iterative algorithms for the identification of initial data
In the simulation study conducted in this work (see Section 6), we will focus on reconstructing
the initial tumour phase field φ0. The rationale for this choice is that knowledge on the tumour
burden (e.g., volume, extension) is a central piece of information in clinical decision-making for
prostate cancer management [15,50]. Additionally, clinical imaging techniques that are currently
used to diagnose, monitor and plan treatments for prostate cancer patients could be leveraged
to obtain measurements of the spatial map of the tumour phase field (e.g., multiparametric
magnetic resonance imaging) [15, 44, 45, 50], including φmeas at time t = T for the purposes of
the present work. Then, given a reconstruction of φ0, for every step we can approximate the
initial data σ0 and p0 by using linear phenomenological laws, as already done in [13,14]:
σ0 = c0,σ + c1,σφ0,
p0 = c0,p + c1,pφ0,
(5.41)
where c0,σ, c1,σ, c0,p, c1,p ∈R are explicit coefficients. In this context, we set κ1 = 1, κ2 = κ3 = 0
in the general objective functional provided by Eq. (4.2), such that the minimisation problem
becomes
arg min
(φ0,σ0,p0)∈K∩Iad
J (φ(T)) =
arg min
(φ0,σ0,p0)∈K∩Iad

2∥φ(T) −φmeas∥2
H,
(5.42)
and such that σ0 and p0 are estimated from φ0 according to Eq. (5.41)
5.3.1
Short time horizon
For short time horizons (e.g. T = 10 days), we will use the Landweber iteration scheme (4.11)
with the steepest descent step size choice (4.12) presented in Section 4.
Thus, given a final
measurement φmeas, an initial guess φ0
0 and a maximum number of iterations j∗, for any j =
0, . . . , j∗we follow the following algorithm:

convergence criteria are not satisfied, then restart from the top in a new iteration.

5.3.2
Long time horizon
Unfortunately, the steepest descent step size (4.12) often becomes very small as the end-time T
grows larger, therefore it does not seem the best choice overall, even if we have a good theoretical
basis. In our case, this can be easily inferred from the results of the simulation study conducted
in the next Section 6. Thus, for longer time horizons (e.g. T = 100 days), we will use the
adaptive gradient descent choice proposed in (4.14) for the step size µj (see Algorithm 1 in [49]).
We recall that we are still dealing with a Landweber scheme, but with a different choice for the
step size. However, in the following we will refer to the algorithm below as the adaptive gradient
descent method, to differentiate it from the previous one. Hence, this method requires a final
measurement of the tumour phase field φmeas, an initial guess φ0
0, initial values for the internal
parameters µ0 and θ0, and a maximum number of iterations j∗. Then, for j = 0, . . . , j∗we
proceed as follows:
1. Given φj
0, set σj

0 and pj
0 = c0,p + c1,pφj
0.

σ(0) = σj

p(0) = pj

in Ω,
and call the corresponding solution (φj, σj, pj).
3. Run the adjoint system
−∂tq −λ∆q + F ′′(φj)q −m(σj)h′′(φj)q + γchσjz −Schz −αchr = 0
in QT ,
−∂tz −η∆z + γhz + γchφjz −m′(σj)h′(φj)q = 0
in QT ,
−∂tr −D∆r + γpr = 0
in QT ,
q = 0,
∂nz = ∂nr = 0
in ΣT ,
q(T) = φj(T) −φmeas,
z(T) = 0,
r(T) = 0
in Ω,
and call the corresponding solution (qj, zj, pj).
4. If j = 0, set µ0 = 0.2/qM where qM is calculated from the global maximum and minimum
control variables for qj

Simulation study
In this section, we perform a simulation study to explore the behaviour of the algorithms de-
scribed in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 to reconstruct the initial tumour phase field considering short
and long time horizons respectively. The simulations of the forward prostate cancer model, the
linearised problem, and the adjoint problem are carried out using the spatial and temporal dis-
cretisation schemes introduced in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. For simplicity of notation and unless
otherwise indicated, in the simulation results provided herein, we drop the superindex h that
was introduced in Section 5.1 to denote finite-dimensional approximations.
6.1
Computational scenario and setup
6.1.1
Model parameters
We consider an aggressive case of prostate cancer, as detailed in Refs. [13,14]. This scenario could
correspond to a tumour exhibiting an intermediate or high Gleason score, which is a fundamental
histopathological metric associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness [44,50]. In the clinic, it is
key to early identify these tumours to ensure adequate monitoring and treatment [24,25,44,50].
In the context of the reconstruction of the initial conditions of the cancer model considered
herein, the aggressive case is also the most interesting: this tumour scenario leads to geometric
changes of the tumour over time due to restricted access to the nutrients (see Ref. [13, 48]),
which pose a challenge for the estimation of the initial tumour phase-field map. We use the same
parameters of the model as in Ref. [14] for the simulations presented in this work, which are
based on previous studies in the literature [6,13,24,25,43,44,46,48,50,55,66].
6.1.2
Numerical implementation details
The numerical algorithms described in Section 5 to solve the forward, linearised, and adjoint
problems as well as to reconstruct the initial tumour phase field were implemented using our
in-house isogeometric codes to simulate prostate cancer growth [13, 14, 43, 46, 48]. These codes
were developed following the general directions and algorithms provided in Ref. [16].
The numerical simulations for the reconstruction algorithms considered in this work are
performed in a square tissue patch with side length Ld =3000 µm. This computational domain
is discretised using 256 C1-continuous quadratic B-spline elements per side. We further consider
a constant time step, which is set to ∆tn = 0.1 days for the forward and linearised problems. As
the adjoint problem runs backwards in time, we set ∆tn = −0.1 days for its time discretisation.
We set the tolerance of the Newton-Rapshon method to εNR = 10−3. The convergence of
the GMRES method is set to a tolerance of εGMRES = 10−3 and a maximum of 500 iterations.
The convergence of the Landweber iteration scheme and the adaptive gradient descent algorithm
used to reconstruct the initial tumour phase field is fixed at a tolerance of εSD = 10−4 and a
maximum of 500 iterations for both methods.

Beretta – Cavaterra – Fornoni – Lorenzo – Rocca
6.1.3
Ground truth
To assess the performance of the tumour phase field reconstruction methods described in Sec-
tions 5.3.1 and 5.3.2, we consider a reference simulation of the prostate cancer model. This in
silico ground truth is generated with a finer mesh within the same spline space defined above.
In particular, we use twice the number of elements along each spatial direction (i.e., 512 × 512
elements). We consider an initial phase field configuration consisting of an ellipsoidal tumour
placed in the centre of the computational domain (i.e., (xc, yc) = (Ld/2, Ld/2)) and with semi-
axes a =150 µm and b =200 µm parallel to the sides of the domain. We implement this initial
condition via the L2-projection of the hyperbolic tangent function
φ0(x1, x2) = 1

(6.1)
over the C1-continuous quadratic B-spline space supporting our spatial discretisation. This op-
eration provides the control variables φ0,A = φA(0), A = 1, . . . , nf, for the spline representation
of the phase-field initial condition, i.e., φh
0(x) = φh(0, x) = Pnf
A=1 φ0,ANA(x) (see Section 5.1).
In particular, this ground truth simulation also provides the terminal measurement φmeas. Ad-
ditionally, we analyse the performance of the reconstruction algorithms in the presence of noise.
Towards this end, we affected the tumour measurement at the time horizon φmeas with 10% Gaus-
sian noise, which was applied to the control variables φmeas,A > 0.001. This implementation fol-
lows the usual thresholding segmentation approaches used in the construction of tumour-defining
spatial maps from imaging data for their ensuing use in biophysical modelling [1,44].
6.1.4
Initial guess
To start the reconstruction algorithms, the initial guess φ0
0 consists of a small spherical tumour
implemented using Eq. (6.1) with radius a = b =100 µm and centre coordinates (xc, yc) matching
the centre of mass of the tumour phase field map φmeas measured at t = T, which is used to
define the objective functional of the minimisation problem (see Eq. (5.42)). The rationale for
this choice is having a sufficiently small tumour aligned with the observed tumour configuration
at t = T as a reasonable starting point to facilitate the iterative reconstruction of φ0
0.
6.1.5
Metrics to assess the reconstruction of the tumour phase field
We assess the tumour phase field at t = 0 and t = T in terms of a panel of four metrics that are
commonly used in the literature of mathematical models of cancer [30, 35, 44, 45, 63]. First, we
use the relative error in tumour volume Vφ. The latter is calculated via spatial integration of the
tumour phase field over the volume enclosed by the isosurface φ = 0.5, which we denote by Ωφ.
This isosurface implicitly tracks the interface between healthy and tumour tissue [13,14,46,48].
Thus, we calculate Vφ as
Vφ =
Z
Ωφ
dx,
and the relative error in tumour volume as
eV,t = eV (t) = V ref
φ
(t) −V rec
φ
(t)
V ref
φ
(t)
,
where V ref
φ
is the volume of the tumour calculated from the tumour phase field of the reference
(i.e., ground truth) simulation φref and V rec
φ
is the volume of the tumour calculated from the
reconstructed tumour phase field φrec. Second, we use the Sørensen-Dice similarity coefficient
(DSC) to assess whether the volume of the reconstructed tumour phase field matches the one
Reconstructing early states of prostate cancer

Figure 1: Reconstruction of the initial tumour phase field from a measurement at T = 15 days using the
Landweber iteration scheme. The first two columns compare the tumour phase field from the reference
simulation and the corresponding reconstruction at t = 0 and t = T. The plot in the last column provides
the values of the four metrics used to assess the reconstruction of the tumour phase field in each iteration
of the Landweber algorithm.
from the reference configuration at the same time [30,44,63]. Towards this end, we calculate the
DSC at time t as
DSCt = DSC(t) =
2V int
φ (t)
V rec
φ
(t) + V ref
φ
(t)
,
where V int
φ
is the volume of the intersection of the tumour phase fields from the ground truth
and resulting from the reconstruction procedure. The volumes to calculate the DSC are also cal-
culated with respect to the corresponding isosurfaces φ = 0.5 for the reference and reconstructed
tumour phase fields. Third, we use the relative L2 error of the reconstructed tumour phase field
with respect to its counterpart in the reference simulation. Hence, the L2 error is calculated as
eL2,t = eL2(t) = ∥φref(t) −φrec(t)∥L2(Ω)
∥φref(t)∥L2(Ω)
Finally, we also calculate the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) [30,35,41,44] to assess
the pointwise agreement between the reference and reconstructed tumour phase fields as
CCCt = CCC(t) =
2Cov(φref(t), φrec(t))
Var(φref(t)) + Var(φrec(t)) + (Mean(φref(t)) −Mean(φrec(t)))2 ,
where the covariance, variances, and means of the reference and reconstructed tumour phase
fields are calculated over the volume enclosed by the corresponding φ = 0.5 isosurfaces.
6.2
Reconstruction of the tumour phase field for short time horizons
We analyse the performance of the Landweber iteration scheme in a computational scenario with
a short time horizon of T = 15 days. Figure 1 provides the reconstruction of the tumour phase
field at t = 0 and at the time horizon t = T, as well as a comparison of these results to the
ground truth simulation at the same time points. Qualitatively, we observe that the Landweber
method yields a very good reconstruction of the tumour phase field at t = 0, and that this results
22

Figure 2: Convergence of the Landweber algorithm for T = 15 days. This figure provides the changes
of the relative L2 error of the reconstructed tumour phase field at t = 0 and t = T. For eL2,0, we also
plot a straight dotted line with the same slope as the linear portion of the trajectory of the relative L2
error. The value of this slope is -9.47·10−2, which corresponds to a value of parameter c of 1.96·10−1 in
Theorem 4.5. Thus, the convergence in all scenarios is infralinear, as it was found theoretically.
in an excellent match to the measurement of the tumour phase field from the ground truth at
t = T, which was used to drive the inverse problem. Figure 1 also provides the values of the
metrics used to assess the reconstruction of the tumour phase field at both t = 0 and t = T in
each iteration of the Landweber scheme until reaching convergence. These quantitative results
demonstrate that this method achieves an accurate reconstruction of the tumour phase field at
both t = 0 and t = T. Indeed, these quantitative results show a minimal error at t = T, thereby
confirming that the reconstruction algorithm yields a perfect match to the available measurement
of the tumour phase field at the time horizon. Furthermore, we also obtain a very small error
in the tumour volume and a high DSC for the reconstructed tumour phase field at t = 0, which
indicate an excellent reconstruction of the geometry of the initial tumour. While the CCC and
the L2 error at t = 0 reveal some mismatch between the reconstructed tumour and the ground
truth at t = 0, these results still represent a successful recovery of the tumour phase field as
compared with the corresponding values of these metrics obtained in the assessment of model
calibration and forecasting in the literature [30,44,63,64]. Moreover, the trajectory of the values
of all assessment metrics during the iterations plateaus towards the end of the reconstruction
procedure, which suggests the achievement of sufficient convergence for the chosen tolerance.
In Figure 2 we provide more detail of the convergence rate of the Landweber iteration scheme
according to the relative L2 error. In particular, the slope of the linear part of the trajectory
of the relative L2 error of the reconstructed initial tumour phase field along the Landweber
iterations is -9.47·10−2. This slope also corresponds to a value of parameter c in Theorem 4.5
of 1.96·10−1. Thus, Figure 2 shows that the convergence rate of the Landweber reconstruction
algorithm is infralinear in accordance with Theorem 4.5.
To further understand the reconstruction procedure with the Landweber iteration scheme,
Figure 3 shows the tumour phase field and its associated dual variable (q, which is used to update
the iterates of the initial tumour phase field) at t = 0 and t = T during several iterations of the
Landweber algorithm. The results depicted in Figure 3 show how this reconstruction method
progressively updates the starting guess of the initial tumour phase field to optimally match
the measurement of the tumour at the time horizon. We observe that the initial guess of the
tumour is first increased in size in all directions of space. Once the iterates of φ0 approach the
size of the smallest axis of the ellipsoidal tumour in the ground truth at t = 0, the algorithm
then continues enlarging φ0 in the direction of the longest axis. Then, as the reconstruction

procedure approaches convergence, the updates of the initial tumour phase field are increasingly
focused along the interface between tumour and healthy tissue. We note that these updates
are obtained by solving the dual problem, which is initialised using the mismatch between the
tumour phase field and its corresponding measurement at time t = T. Hence, the spatial map
of qT in the computational scenarios considered herein initially shows values between -1 and 0,
in which the negative values indicate regions that need to be occupied by the tumour. Towards
this end, solving the dual problem maps this mismatch at time t = T into precise updates of
the tumour phase field at t = 0. As the reconstruction method proceeds, the mismatch between
the tumour measurement and model reconstruction at the time horizon progressively diminishes,
which progressively reduces the range of values of qT towards zero. This results in a parallel
contraction of the value range and increased localisation of q0 to update the initial tumour phase

field. Additionally, the Landweber adaptive step size exhibits a median (range) of 3.53·10−2
(2.70·10−2, 9.09·10−2). Hence, the product of these step size values by the increasingly lower
values of q0 during the iterations of the Landweber algorithm results in a progressively smaller
update to the initial tumour phase field, which further translates into minimal changes to φT as
the algorithm approaches convergence.

Reconstruction of the tumour phase field for long time horizons
We study the performance of the adaptive gradient descent algorithm in two computational
scenarios with a long time horizon of T = 90 and 365 days. Figure 4 shows that this method can
reconstruct the earlier state of the tumour considering a time horizon of T = 90 days efficiently
and accurately. Additionally, the results in Figure 5 confirm that the adaptive gradient descent
method can reconstruct the tumour state a year before acquiring the spatial measurement (i.e.,
T = 365 days). Nevertheless, for this last scenario, we increased the tolerance εSD to 0.1 and we
had to change the initial guess from a small round tumour (as indicated in Section 6.1.4) to an
ellipsoidal tumour with larger vertical axis (a =100 µm, b =150 µm). The tolerance increment
is implemented based on the results of a first simulation with the original value indicated in
Section 6.1, which showed that it was too strict for this case. This issue could be motivated by
the drastic geometric changes of the tumour phase field at t = T, which may accumulate small
local reconstruction errors over a large tumour volume. The rationale for adapting the initial
guess is that the round tumour used in previous simulations led to a failure of the reconstruction
algorithm, whereby the size of φ0 progressively decreases in each iteration of the adaptive gradient
descent method until vanishing. We believe that this issue stems from a choice of an initial guess
that is too far from the ground truth in this computational scenario. Thus, we opted to change
the initial guess according to the known dynamics of the model. In particular, the simulations
of the model presented in [13] show that the horizontal tumour branches observed at t = T
come from an ellipsoidal tumour with a longer axis in the orthogonal direction to the branches
at time t = 0, as observed in the simulation used to generate the ground truth in this work.
After adjusting the initial guess to match this knowledge from the model dynamics, we observe

an excellent performance of the adaptive gradient descent. We would like to remark that the
logic leveraged to adjust the initial guess can also be followed in actual clinical scenarios: given
a spatial tumour measurement and a known model, one can choose the initial guess of the
early state of the tumour phase field that favours a model prediction of the tumour morphology
observed in the measurement.
Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that the adaptive gradient descent method achieves a high qual-
itative and quantitative agreement between the reconstructed tumour phase field and the ground
truth both at t = 0 and t = T in the two computational scenarios considered in this section. As
observed for the Landweber method, the reconstruction yields very good results at time t = T
according to all metrics. While the DSC and relative error in the tumour volume at t = 0 show
that the reconstructed tumour at t = 0 is practically identical to the ground truth, the CCC and
the relative L2 error suggest that there is a certain mismatch. Nevertheless, the values of these
metrics at time t = 0 still represent a successful reconstruction of the initial tumour morphol-
ogy, and they are also comparable to prediction errors obtained in the computational tumour
forecasting studies in the literature [30,44,63,64]. For the T = 90 day scenario, the plateauing
trend in all metrics at t = 0 and t = T suggests that the adaptive gradient descent method has
already reached convergence for the tolerance considered in the simulation. Thus, these results
further support the use of a larger tolerance to obtain equally acceptable reconstruction results
in these scenarios and, hence, facilitate convergence in more demanding cases. Indeed, this is the
case of the T = 365 day scenario, in which we observe a progressive improvement of the metrics
over the iterations of the adaptive gradient descent algorithm to satisfactory values according
to computational oncology literature [30,44,63,64]. In this computational scenario, only DSC0,
DSCT , CCC0, and eV,T start to reach a plateau towards the end of the simulation. The lack
of a generalised plateauing trend results from the earlier termination of the adaptive gradient
descent algorithm caused by the increase in convergence tolerance εSD.
Figures 6 and 7 further show the changes in the tumour phase field φ and the dual variable
q at times t = 0 and t = T obtained in four iterations of the reconstruction procedure in the
two computational scenarios in this section. The results for T = 90 days are similar to those

obtained with the Landweber method: the updates of the initial tumour phase field φ0 obtained
from q0 initially enlarge the tumour in both directions of space, then modify the tumour shape
in the direction with larger mismatch with respect to the ground truth (i.e., in the vertical
direction), and finally adjust the morphology of φ0 along the interface. In the T = 365 day
scenario, we observe that the initial ellipsoidal tumour progressively adjusts its shape while
increasing its size until the algorithm reaches convergence. Additionally, for both computational
scenarios in this section, we observe that the absolute values and range of the dual variable q
at both t = 0 and t = T decrease globally as the reconstruction advances and the mismatch
between the tumour reconstruction and the ground truth diminishes, as we had also observed
with the Landweber method. Figures 6 and 7 also show that the values of q0 increase as we
consider a higher time horizon T. To ensure a stable update of the initial tumour phase field,

Reconstruction of the tumour phase field using ground truth affected by
noise
In this section, we analyse the performance of the Landweber iteration scheme and the adaptive
gradient descent algorithm in the presence of noise.
Figure 8 shows the results for a time
horizon T = 15 days using the Landweber iteration scheme, including the tumour reconstruction
at t = 0 and t = T along with the evolution of the metrics to assess the quality of the tumour
reconstruction. Additionally, Figures 9 and 10 provide the corresponding results for time horizon

T = 90 and 365 days using the adaptive gradient descent algorithm. Similarly to the long-time
horizon results presented in Section 6.3, for the latter scenario we adjusted the initial guess to
an ellipsoid (a =100 µm, b =150 µm) and we further increased the tolerance εSD to 0.1 in order
to achieve convergence.
In Figures 8-10, the values of the metrics at t = T and t = 0 are
calculated with respect to the ground truth without noise to enable comparison with respect
to the results in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. Moreover, Figures 11, 12, and 13 show the changes in

the tumour phase field and the dual variable q at t = 0 and t = T during the initial tumour
reconstruction with the Landweber iteration scheme (T = 15 days) and the adaptive gradient
descent algorithm (T = 90 and 365 days). The results in Figures 8-10 are analogous to those
presented in Figures 1, 4, and 5 respectively. Indeed, the values of the reconstruction metrics at
t = 0 and t = T are virtually the same as those obtained in the corresponding scenarios without
noise. The presence of noise only impacts in a small increase in the number of iterations for
convergence in the scenarios with T = 15 and 90 days. Additionally, the spatial maps obtained
for φ0, q0, φT , and qT during the tumour reconstruction in the scenarios with a noisy φmeas
align with those calculated in the corresponding scenarios without noise (see Figures 3, 6, and 7,
respectively). The main difference is observed for qT , since the noisy φmeas affects its calculation
in each iteration of the reconstruction algorithms. We further observe that the presence of noise
only impacts q0 when the difference between φmeas and φT is in the neighbourhood of the value of
the added noise. In this situation, qT essentially consists of noisy values that ultimately render an
asymmetric or irregular q0 map. However, given that the update of the initial tumour phase field
towards the end of the algorithm is minimal, these irregularities in q0 do not impact the tumour
reconstruction. Thus, the qualitative and quantitative accuracy of the tumour reconstruction
at time t = 0 and t = T is virtually the same despite the noise added to φmeas. These results
demonstrate the robustness of the Landweber iteration scheme and the adaptive gradient descent
method in recovering the initial ground truth under noisy measurements.

Discussion
In this work, we studied the inverse problem of reconstructing an earlier state of prostate cancer
from a given spatial measurement collected at a certain time of interest T. Within the inverse
problem formulation, this instant becomes the time horizon and we used our previously pre-
sented phase-field model to recover prostate cancer growth before the measurement [5, 13, 14].
From a mathematical perspective, the inverse problem consists of reconstructing the initial data

that such a problem is generally known to be severly ill-posed, in particular the larger the fi-
nal time T grows. Leveraging the quantitative Lipschitz stability estimate on finite-dimensional
subspaces found in [5], we motivated the use of a Landweber iteration scheme to approximate
the solution of the inverse problem. We proved some theoretical convergence results of such a
method in both its variants with a fixed and an adaptive steepest descent step size. With the idea
of accelerating its convergence, especially for the most challenging case of large time horizons T,
we also employed a different choice of the step size, proposed in [49]. Even if lacking theoretical
guarantees, due to the heavy use of convexity assumptions in [49], this second method proved
very powerful in tackling such challenging cases.
To better understand the performance of the reconstruction algorithms, we conducted a sim-

truth data generated by the phase-field model.
Our results show that the Landweber itera-
tion scheme yields a high-quality reconstruction of the initial tumour conditions for short time
horizons (e.g., a few weeks).
These results also confirmed the infralinear convergence of the
Landweber method that was derived analytically in Theorem 4.5. Furthermore, the computa-
tional study presented in this work demonstrated the capability of the adaptive gradient descent
method to enable the reconstruction of tumours for longer time horizons (e.g., several months
to one year). Nevertheless, to achieve convergence in the longest time horizon considered in the
study (T = 365 days) we needed to adapt the initial guess to a closer geometry to the ground
truth and reduce the convergence tolerance used in the other time horizon scenarios. Of note,
this last choice was supported by the results for shorter T cases since they show that conver-

gence is achieved before the reconstruction algorithm reaches the preset tolerance. Additionally,
the results obtained for the T = 365 demonstrate an excellent reconstruction of the tumour,
which are comparable to the results obtained with the adaptive gradient descent algorithm for
T = 90 and the preset tolerance. To complete our simulation study, we further analysed the
performance of both reconstruction methods under a noisy measurement at the time horizon.
Our simulation results in this situation show that both reconstruction algorithms can recover
the initial conditions of the tumour with sufficiently high quality. Thus, our simulation study
suggests that (i) the Landweber iteration scheme might be preferred for the reconstruction of
recent stages of a tumour (i.e., short T) due to the existence of robust convergence analytical
guarantees, and (ii) the adaptive gradient descent algorithm can be alternatively leveraged to
efficiently handle longer temporal reconstructions, although it may require using initial guesses

closer to the ground truth and higher tolerances for convergence.
We believe that we have obtained encouraging results, especially considering that we treated
a complex system in full generality, differently from the partial results obtained in the previously
mentioned works [34, 57, 58]. Nevertheless, this work also presents some limitations that can
be addressed in future studies.
First, we only considered a particular phase-field model for
tumour growth [5, 13, 14]. A more complete analysis of the reconstruction algorithms studied
herein should also consider different kinds of phase-field models or models based on Fisher-
Kolmogorov and biomechanical formulations, which are also commonly used in computational
oncology [30, 45, 56, 60, 63, 64]. Additionally, we only considered untreated growth, which can
be of interest for newly-diagnosed tumours [44], but future studies could also address tumour
reconstruction including treatment effects [13,30,45,64], which can be of interest when imaging
data are acquired during therapy. Second, the model parameters governing tumour growth were
assumed to be known. This might be feasible in preclinical cases (e.g., in vitro and in vivo
animal studies) leveraging cancer cell lines with previously characterised dynamic features (e.g.,
proliferation and invasion rates) [8, 40, 67]. However, the application of tumour reconstruction
methods in clinical scenarios will require the recovery of not only the initial conditions of the
tumour, but also the main parameters governing its growth dynamics [45, 58].
Of note, for
such a challenging mathematical problem, it might be necessary to first perform a sensitivity
analysis and a parameter identifiability study to find a small set of significant parameters that
can be effectively reconstructed [17, 47]. Third, our simulation study focused on a 2D square
tissue patch. Although this computational setup facilitated the analysis of the reconstruction
algorithms, future studies should also investigate their performance in 3D scenarios and consider
patient-specific organ anatomies extracted from the reference imaging measurement at the time
horizon [30, 43, 44, 48, 62, 63, 66]. Finally, we used synthetic data generated via simulation of
our phase-field model to generate the ground truth. While this approach enables preliminary
confirmation that the proposed reconstruction methods can recover spatiotemporal tumour maps
matching the model dynamics, their ultimate validation needs to employ real-world data (e.g.,
magnetic resonance imaging, computerised tomography) [45].
Despite the formidable mathematical and computational challenges involved in the recon-
struction of early tumour stages from a unique spatial measurement, the advances in the under-
standing of this problem could ultimately have a profound impact on the use of computational tu-
mour forecasts in clinical scenarios. In particular, the accurate personalised prediction of tumour
growth from a single imaging dataset at diagnosis is a long-standing challenge in the field of com-
putational oncology, which could dramatically improve treatment planning for better therapeutic
outcomes [14, 35, 42, 45] as well as patient triaging to adequate management options [7, 44, 68].
Thus, efficient and robust tumour reconstruction methods can be a key computational asset
in the design of digital twins to optimise cancer monitoring and treatment [29, 65, 68], thereby
contributing towards a more predictive and personalised paradigm in clinical oncology.
