Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), like V S2, display unique electronic, magnetic, and
optical properties, making them promising for spintronic and optoelectronic applications. Using
first-principles calculations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT), we study the effect
of Fe-doping on the electronic and magnetic properties of a V S2 monolayer.
The pristine V S2
monolayer has ferromagnetic order and a small energy bandgap. This work aims to comprehensively
study the substitution of selected Vanadium atoms in the V S2 monolayer by Iron (Fe) atoms,
where the substitution concerns Vanadium atoms at various sites within the 2x2 and 3x3 supercells.
This leads to significant modifications of the electronic band structure, magnetic anisotropy energy
(MAE), and optical response (e.g., dielectric constant and absorption coefficient).
The results
provide valuable insights into engineering the V S2 monolayer properties for future applications,
ranging from spintronics to cancer therapy in medical science.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, there has been significant interest in two-
dimensional (2D) materials because of their fascinating
properties and potential application possibilities. Many
such materials are currently known.
Among them,
graphene and other materials like hexagonal boron ni-
tride (h-BN), Black Phosphorus (BP), silicon carbide,
and various metal dichalcogenides are the most repre-
sentative ones [1–17].
Currently, the Transition Metal
Dichalcogenides (TMDs) are of exceptional interest.
These materials are described by the general chemical
formula MX2, where M stands for a transition metal el-
ement (such as Mo, W, Nb, and V), while X represents
a chalcogen element (like S, Se, and Te). More than 60
different combinations of these materials are currently
known, which have different physical properties: metal-
lic, semiconducting, or superconducting ones [18–22]. It
is also worth mentioning that the 2D layered TMDs
(monolayers, bilayers, or a few-layer structure) usually
have properties, especially band structure, that are dis-
tinct from those of their bulk counterparts [23]. Many
different experimental methods, like exfoliation, liquid
exfoliation, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), have
been utilized to achieve these materials in the monolayer
or bilayer forms [24–26].
Most of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
lack magnetism in their pristine forms, unlike the tran-
sition metal trihalides such as CrI3 structures [27, 28].
However, there are methods that enable making them
magnetic, like, for instance, doping with magnetic atoms,
adsorption of non-metal elements, and leveraging edge
effects [29–34]. For example, the creation of triple va-
cancies in single-layer MoS2 has been proposed as one of
the means to introduce a net magnetic moment, while
∗e-mail:mirali.jafari@amu.edu.pl; e-mail:adyrdal@amu.edu.pl
other defects related to Mo and S atoms have a negligi-
ble impact on the non-magnetic ground state [35]. Gen-
erally, controlling the non-magnetic and magnetic states
in MoS2 nanoribbons can be achieved via the interplay
between defects and also adsorption, with the latter de-
pending on the type of defects and adsorption sites. How-
ever, doing this in other TMD materials may not be so
easy, and one can face more challenges, as exciting mag-
netic properties in non-magnetic materials are strongly
related to the nature of defects, edge states, and dopant
positions.
An intriguing group of the TMDs family is the group of
vanadium dichalcogenides (VX2, where X can be Sulfur,
Selenium, or Tellurium), with VS2 being the most promi-
nent representative. These materials exist in two differ-
ent phases, denoted as H and T, each possessing unique
crystal structures and physical characteristics [36]. In-
trinsic ferromagnetism in VS2 was firstly predicted using
first-principle calculations and then was confirmed ex-
perimentally. This achievement received great attention
from researchers and put VS2 in the range of crucial ma-
terials for the development of novel technologies [37, 38].
Recently, one can observe growing interest concerning
different stability and magnetic properties of the H and
T phases of VS2 monolayers. In contrast to earlier con-
jectures, the H-phase of these materials is more stable,
displaying ferromagnetic order with an easy axis aligned
within the layer plane [39, 40]. One should note that the
emergence of new experimental techniques that enable
the fabrication of VS2 monolayers opens the opportunity
to develop new nanoelectronics devices [21, 41]. There
are several experimental techniques that allow to con-
trol and modulate the electronic and magnetic proper-
ties of VS2. One of such methods is the doping strategy
[37, 42, 43].
Using first-principle calculations, the im-
pact of dopants, like chromium, molybdenum, and tung-
sten, on the electronic structure and phase transitions of
VS2 monolayers has been explicated [44]. Furthermore,
arXiv:2411.12001v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  18 Nov 2024

experimental observations showed that the charge dop-
ing could lead to the phase transitions from 2H-phase
over 1T phase and subsequently to the emergence of a
bipolar magnetic semiconducting behavior, with poten-
tial applications in phase-change electrical devices [43].
In addition to that, the effect of dopants like Iron (Fe)
on strain engineering, as well as magnetic ordering, has
been studied to figure out the potential applications in
the spintronic field and also enhance the magnetic cou-
pling [37].
The Fe-doping is used to tune the optical,
magnetic, and electrical properties of VS2, which makes
it useful in different fields from electronic to biomedicine
[45–47]. The presence of different Fe-doping structures
and their influence on the electronic and magnetic prop-
erties of VS2 allows to make progress in a wide range of
fields, including spintronics, optoelectronics, and cataly-
sis [48].
In this work, we study VS2 and the doping strategy
using the computation analysis. We comprehensively an-
alyze the essential properties of the H-phase, and we be-
gin with calculating the electronic properties of the pris-
tine monolayer of VS2. Next, we replace V-atoms with
the Fe ones in different sites of the extended supercell
of VS2.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II
provides an overview of the methodology and computa-
tional techniques used. Section III discusses the findings
derived from the computational analysis. Finally, Section
IV summarizes the concluding remarks.

METHODS
To calculate the electronic structure and investigate
physical parameters, we have used the Density Func-
tional Theory (DFT) and the Quantum ATK code
package (version 2021.06-SP2) [49].
This code pack-
age relies on the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [50], and
Kohn–Sham equations [51]. The wave function was ex-
panded using the SG15 collection of optimized norm-
conserving Vanderbilt (ONCV) pseudopotentials along
with the High Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals
(LCAO-U) basis set.
[52] For the exchange correla-
tion, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized-
gradient approximation (GGA) was applied. [53] We set
the energy mesh-cutoff to 600 eV and the convergence
criteria to 1e-06 eV (1e-08 eV for magnetic anisotropy
energy) for each primitive cell.
To sample the two-
dimensional Brillouin zone, we utilized a k-point grid of
30 × 30 × 1.
[54] All structures under consideration
have been fully optimized until the force on each atom
dropped below 0.005 eV/˚A. To prevent artificial interac-
tion between image layers, we incorporated vacuum lay-
ers of at least 20 Angstrom. Furthermore, to account for
the electron-electron correlation effect of Vanadium (V)
localized 3d orbitals, we implemented DFT+U calcula-
tions. Here, U denotes the effective potential of the onsite
Coulomb interaction for the Fe-3d or V-3d electrons. [55]

RESULTS
A.
Structural Properties
Various types of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
(TMDs) exist naturally or have been synthesized, with
their structures determined by the way in which the
monolayers MX2 are arranged. In this formula, M stands
for transition-metal elements, like Mo, W, and V, while
X represents chalcogen elements, such as S, Se, and Te.
The monolayer of Vanadium diselenide, VS2, consists of
a hexagonal sheet of V atoms sandwiched between two
sheets of chalcogen S atoms.
The atomic structure of
the V sheets is reminiscent of the hexagonal structure
of graphene. The VS2 monolayer exists in two different
forms, i.e., in the H-phase and in the T-phase. These
two phases differ by the way the chalcogen atoms are co-
ordinated. In this paper, we focus on the H-phase as it
is more stable. In this phase, with the primitive cells il-
lustrated in Figure 1(a) and (b), the nearest six S atoms
enclose each V atom, while each S atom is connected to
the three nearest-neighbour V atoms. The V atoms in
H-VS2 occupy positions within the trigonal prism forms
created by the surrounding S atoms. The H-VS2 corre-
sponds to the P 6M2 (D3h) symmetry point group, where
a V atom sits at Wyckoff site 1(a) with the coordinates
(0, 0, 0) and S atoms fill the 2(h) sites at the positions
3
(1/3, 2/3). The optimized lattice parameter of pure VS2
was found to be 3.178 ˚A, in good agreement with previ-
ous studies [37, 41, 56, 57].
Using the optimized VS2 monolayer, as described
above, we now begin the Fe-doping procedure for as-
sumed supercells and different doping sites.
This ap-
proach not only allows one to have a comprehensive
study of the influence of random Fe-doping, but it is also
suitable for comparison with experimental observations,
which is crucial for validating theoretical predictions and
understanding practical aspects of the materials. Figure
1 (c) illustrates a representative supercell configuration
of size 2x2, with Fe-doping at sites labeled as 0 or at sites
labeled as 1. The Fe contribution constitutes then 8.33%
of the entire structure. The lattice parameter and bond
lengths (dV −S, dF e−S) are summarized in Table I. As one
can see in this table, the lattice parameter is then reduced
by 1.73% for doping sites labeled as 0. This reduction is
due to a change in the local atomic environment by the
doped Fe atoms, which modifies the pristine crystal lat-
tice and leads to local distortions. The reason for this
change is the difference in the atomic radii of Fe and V
atoms. The drop in the lattice constant appears since the
iron atom has a smaller atomic radius than the V-atom.
Similarly, other parameters, such as the relevant bond
lengths, also exhibit a decrease. Intriguingly, changing
the position of Fe from site 0 to site 1 does not induce
significant changes in the structural parameters, suggest-
ing that the structural integrity of the VS2 monolayer is
robust against such single Fe-doping perturbations.
In the next step, we increase the size of the supercell
up to the 3 × 3 primitive unit cells. Then, we introduce
Fe atoms in various positions and for different configura-
tions, including single, dual, and triad doping. The con-
tribution of Fe to the entire structure amounts to 3.70%,
7.40%, and 11.11% for single, dual, and triad Fe-doping,
respectively. As in the case of 2x2 supercell, the lattice
parameter becomes reduced with Fe-doping, and for sin-
gle doping, this reduction is the lowest one and achieves
0.94%. The largest reduction, 2.30%, is for the triad dop-
ing (see Table I for details). Interestingly, dual doping
displays a slightly different behavior. When the Fe atoms
are positioned far from each other (sites 2 and 6), there
is a higher reduction if compared to that when Fe atoms
are closer to each other (sites 3 and 4), with the cor-
responding reductions of 1.88% and 1.57%, respectively
(see Table I). To account for this difference, we note that
when the doped Fe atoms are closer, their mutual inter-
action is stronger, while the overall interaction with the
surroundings is reduced to a smaller number of the host-
material atoms. This results in a smaller reduction in
the lattice parameter of VS2 in comparison to what one
would expect if the doped Fe atoms are well separated
and independently interact with the neighboring atoms
of the host material. In the following subsections, B and
C, we analyze how the structural changes due to Fe dop-
ing modify electronic, magnetic, and optical properties.

structures preserve their FM order. This continuity of
ferromagnetic behavior with doping appears because iron
and vanadium are both transition metals, with their d-
orbitals playing the key role in magnetic interactions and
stabilization of the ferromagnetic configuration. To get a
clearer insight into this issue and make the results more
reliable, we include Coulomb repulsion parameters (U)
of 1 and 2 eV for Fe and V atoms, respectively [59, 60].
Furthermore, in both the clean VS2 monolayer and the
Fe-doped structures, there is a spin-orbit coupling (SOC),
which is crucial in our analysis. To understand the role
of both Coulomb interactions and SOC, we separately
studied their influence on the electronic properties. For
band structure calculations, we selected the Γ-K-M-K′-Γ
high symmetry paths within the Brillouin zone (BZ) for
all structures.
In the PBE+U calculations, illustrated
in Figure 3 and summarized in Table II, the pure VS2
monolayer exhibits a small band gap of 0.45 eV, reveal-
ing its semiconducting behavior. Upon including SOC in
the calculations, as illustrated in Figure 4, the pure V S2
monolayer keeps its semiconducting behavior, although
with slight modifications of the electronic structure ob-
served in the vicinity of the K and K
′ valleys. These
modifications may have some implications for potential
applications in electronics, valleytronics, and optoelec-
tronics. As the K and K
′ points are non-equivalent in
the presence of SOC, unlike in the absence of spin-orbit
coupling, we observe intrinsic valley splitting of 36 meV
as illustrated in Figure 4 (V S2 monolayer).
This val-
ley splitting, ∆E, is notable and also crucial for various
electronic properties.
Moreover, its magnitude can be
modified with different methods such as strain engineer-
ing, fabrication methods of heterostructures, and doping
strategies. In this study, our objective is to investigate
the structural behavior under different doping scenarios
across various cell configurations.
Now, we introduce Fe atoms into the VS2 monolayer
in various sites and for various supercells. Consider first
the case of a 2x2 supercell with the Fe atom doped in
site 0, see Figure 1. As shown in Figure 3, the energy
bandgap decreases to 0.30 eV upon doping, and this is
accompanied by a down-shift of the bands, as it is visi-
ble in the points K and K′. This effect can be further
examined in Figure 4, where we present the projected
band structure (FAT-bands) and Projected Density of
States (PDOS). Despite the reduction of the bandgap in
the PBE+U calculations, the band gap slightly increases
when the spin-orbit coupling is included in the calcula-
tions. This rather unexpected trend arises from signif-
icant modifications in the conduction band induced by
the presence of Fe atoms in the 2x2 supercell. Specif-
ically, the localized effect of Fe doping in this config-
uration likely induces substantial perturbations in the
electronic structure of neighboring VS2 units.
Conse-
quently, this localized impurity has a significant impact
on the electronic states, leading to unexpected changes in
the band structure under the influence of spin-orbit cou-
pling. Furthermore, the spatial arrangement of Fe atoms
in the 2x2 supercell (which is small) leads to a specific
electronic interaction that cannot be present in the case
of larger supercells. Thus, the structural and electronic
characteristics of the 2x2 supercell, especially concerning
the arrangement and interaction of Fe atoms, affect the
bandgap when we consider both +U and +SOC calcu-

lations. Also noteworthy is the fact that the majority
of bands near the Fermi level are associated with VS2.
However, for valence bands near the points K and K’,
the influence of Fe doping becomes particularly evident
at the K point due to spin-orbit-induced hybridization
with the Fe-3d electrons. The hybridization effect can
lead to a remarkable difference in the spin polarization
and peaks in the DOS near the Fermi level, which comes
from the complex interaction between Fe and VS2 elec-
tronic states. Additionally, PDOS analysis reveals that
the majority of states for the conduction bands are spin-
down ones. In contrast, the valence bands predominantly
spin up near the Fermi level due to the unique electronic
configuration induced by the Fe doping. A similar situ-
ation is observed for the Fe doping at site 1 in the 2x2
supercell. Some difference in the band structure appears
due to a small difference in the Fe-VS2 interactions in
the two different doping sites.
From Table II, it is evident that increasing the super-
cell to 3x3 and keeping the single Fe-doping leads to a
decrease in the energy band gap, regardless of whether
Coulomb or spin-orbit interactions are considered. How-
ever, for the case of dual Fe-doping, especially in cases
where the Fe atoms are not in nearest neighbor posi-
tions (sites 0,7 and sites 2,6), the bandgap increases.
Conversely, substituting Fe atoms in two neighboring V
sites (sites 3,4) leads to significant geometric modifica-
tions compared to the primitive cell structure, resulting
in a modified band structure that changes from semi-
conducting to metallic. A similar trend is observed for
triad Fe-doping at sites 2,6,8, where the energy bandgap
decreases and the system transforms into a half-metallic
state, both in the presence of Coulomb interactions and
when the spin-orbit coupling is included. These results
are consistent with certain experimental findings. More
specifically, experimental characterization of the band
gaps of VS2 and Fe-VS2 via the solid-state UV spec-
troscopy has shown that a smaller band gap exists in
structures with Fe-doping. [45] In our calculations, when
a sufficient number of Fe atoms are present compared

(MAE) per unit cell of perfect V S2 monolayer (ML) with
and without Fe-doping and for indicated supercell sizes and
doping concentrations. The MAE is presented as a function

the inset for the definition of θ).
to the entire VS2 monolayer, the bandgap explicitly de-
creases.
This decrease is logical since Fe dopants ex-
ist to change the electronic structure and decrease the
band gap. However, for the 3x3 supercell at sites 0,7 and
sites 2,6, where Fe atoms are not close to each other, the
bandgap increases. This behavior is reasonable, as the
reduced interaction between Fe atoms reduces the mod-
ifications in the electronic structure and thus increases
the bandgap.
2.
Magnetic Anisotropy Energy and Magnetic Moment
One of the important parameters required to under-
stand the behavior of magnetic materials is the Mag-
netic Anisotropy Energy (MAE). Such an anisotropy de-
termines the preferred orientation of magnetization in the
ground state and plays a crucial role in different applica-
tions of magnetic systems, e.g., in spin valves, magnetic
data storage, magnetic sensors, and others. The mag-
netic anisotropy arises from the spin-orbit interaction,
which makes the energy of an electron dependent on the
orientation of its magnetic moment. This, in turn, re-
sults in the emergence of preferred magnetic orientations
within the system. Magnetic anisotropy can be deter-
mined by calculating the energy difference between two
relevant spin orientations using the force theorem, which
gives insight into the stability and behavior of magnetic
systems. Generally, the energy difference between two
well-defined magnetic states, i.e., MAE, can be calcu-
lated from the formula [61]:
MAE = P
i fi(θ1, ϕ1)ϵi(θ1, ϕ1) −P
i fi(θ0, ϕ0)ϵi(θ0, ϕ0), (1)

where, fi(θ, ϕ) denotes the occupation factor for band i
(including the k-point index), with (θ, ϕ) representing the
spin orientation and ϵi(θ, ϕ) indicating the corresponding
band energy. The indices 0 and 1 at (θ and ϕ) refer to the
two corresponding magnetic orientations (two magnetic
states).
In this paper, we focus on the perpendicular
(out-of-plane or easy plane) and in-plane anisotropies.
In the case where the system is magnetically isotropic
(or nearly isotropic) within the plane, the perpendicu-
lar anisotropy is defined as MAE = E[100] −E[001] (or
MAE = E[010] −E[001]), with the x and y axes lying
within the layer plane and the z-axis perpendicular to
the layer. Therefore, a positive value of MAE indicates
a perpendicular easy axis, whereas a negative value cor-
responds to a perpendicular hard axis, i.e., to easy-plane
anisotropy. As it follows from Table II and also as illus-
trated in Figure 5, the pure monolayer of V S2 exhibits
an easy-plane anisotropy of MAE ≈0.20 meV. However,
when we increase the supercell size to 2x2 with single Fe
doping, it is clearly seen that the easy plane anisotropy
survives, but its magnitude is remarkably reduced, and
this reduction is directly related to the presence of Fe-
doping. It is interesting to note that in the case of su-
percell increased to 3x3, the magnitude of the easy-plane
anisotropy increases to -1.381 meV for single-site doping
and to -0.80 meV for dual doping. In turn, in the presence
of triad Fe doping, the easy plane magnetic anisotropy is
reduced again to -0.11 meV, but it is larger than that for
the 2x2 supercell with single-site doping. We note, that
the ability to control the magnetic anisotropy energy is
interesting not only from the fundamental side, but also
from practical reasons.
In our calculations on the Fe-doped VS2 monolay-
ers, we applied two different approaches to study their
magnetic properties – including PBE+U and PBE+SOC
ones. The results on magnetic moments are listed in Ta-
ble III. Firstly, we investigated the magnetic moment of
V atoms in the pristine VS2 monolayer, where we found
1.26 µB and 1.17 µB using the PBE+U and PBE+SOC
methods, respectively. Then, by increasing the supercell
size to a 2x2 one and doping Fe atoms, a sharp decrease
is observed in the magnetic moment of V atoms. This is
due to significant changes in the local electronic structure
and magnetic interaction within the VS2 lattice, which
originate from the presence of Fe atoms.
In turn, the
magnetic moment of the Fe atoms in V S2 is reduced as
compared to its free-standing value, which indicates the
interactions with VS2. In turn, in the case of the 3x3 su-
percell, the magnetic moments are remarkably different
for different Fe doping sites. For certain sites, we find
an enhanced magnetic moment, while in other sites, it is
reduced. This variety is directly related to the interac-
tion between doped Fe-atoms and the VS2 lattice. These
findings emphasize the complexity of magnetic phenom-
ena in Fe-doped V S2 monolayers and provide valuable
insights for the potential applications.

Optical Properties
An important objective of this work is the analysis of
tuning optical properties of VS2 by doping it with Fe
atoms. To achieve this objective, we employ the Kubo-
Greenwood formula to calculate the susceptibility tensor
[62, 63]:
χij(ω) =

nmk
(fmk −fnk)pi

where pi
nm denotes the matrix element of the i-th com-
ponent of the momentum operator between the states n
and m, me represents the electron mass, e is the electron
charge, V stands for volume, Γ is the energy broadening,
ℏωnm = En −Em, and fnk indicates the Fermi distribu-
tion function evaluated at the band energy En(k).
The response coefficients, i.e., the relative dielectric
function ϵ(ω), polarizability α(ω), and optical conduc-
tivity σ(ω) are connected to the susceptibility as follows

shown in Figure 6.
One can note distinct trends that
show fundamental electronic transitions within the ma-
terials. Both the real, ϵr and imaginary, ϵi, parts exhibit
prominent peaks in the energy range around 1 eV, see
Figure 6(a), which suggest significant electronic excita-
tions within this energy range. The sharp drop following
the peaks and subsequent fluctuations at higher energies
reflect the complex interactions between the electronic
states and band structure effects inherent to these ma-
terials. When the Fe atoms are not strongly interacting
with each other, in most cases, one can see trends sim-
ilar to those in the pristine V S2 monolayer. However,
the introduction of Fe atoms into the V S2 lattice in the
geometries (3x3 sites-3,4) and (3x3 sites-2,6,8) leads to
pronounced changes in the dielectric response, particu-
larly observed in the real part of the dielectric constant.
In contrast to the gradual increase observed in the case
of pure V S2 monolayer, the dielectric constant of the Fe-
doped V S2 monolayer starts with a peak in ϵr, Figure
6d and Figure 6f. This is due to the modifications in the
electronic structure arising from the presence of the Fe
atoms, which lead to changes in the band gaps and/or
hybridization effects between Fe-d orbitals and the V S2
host lattice states, where in the band structures, it is
clearly seen that the band gap disappears and the struc-
ture changes to metallic or half-metallic. Such modifica-
tions not only influence the material’s optical properties
but also have the potential for applications in optoelec-
tronic devices.
Further analysis of the absorption coefficient, α, for the
structure Fe-VS2 (3x3 sites-3,4) reveals the anisotropic
optical properties. Unlike the isotropic response observed
in the pure V S2 monolayer and in most other Fe-doped
structures, in this particular case, the Fe-doped mono-
layer exhibits different values of ϵxx, ϵyy, and ϵyx, see
Figure 7 for details. This anisotropy reflects the preferen-
tial alignment or orientation of the Fe dopants within the
atomic lattice. A comprehensive study of the dielectric
function and absorption coefficient can provide valuable
insight into the electronic and optical properties of both
the pristine and Fe-doped V S2. The results achieved in
8
this paper allow for deeper understanding of the funda-
mental properties of the studied V S2 monolayers, and
also can facilitate finding the ways for their practical ap-
plications.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have studied by the DFT methods
both pristine and Iron-doped V S2 monolayers. We fo-
cused on the modifications of electronic and magnetic
properties by various doping schemes. To determine the
electronic structure, we assumed that the doped systems
are periodic with the relevant supercell. Numerically, we
have considered the cases when doping was in the primi-
tive cell of V S2, as well as for the supercells that are 2x2
and 3x3 times larger than the primitive cell. We have
considered situations with different distributions of the
doped Fe atoms in the supercells. Both electron correla-
tion parameter U and spin-orbit coupling were included
in the calculations.
Having determined the electronic structure, we have
analyzed the magnetic moments of the V and Fe atoms
and the dependence of these moments on the distribution
of impurities within the supercells.
In addition, using
the Kubo Greenwood formula, we have calculated optical
properties, including dielectric function, reflectivity, and
extinction coefficient of the investigated structures. The
obtained results show that the optical properties can be
modulated by selective doping of V S2 monolayers. They
also show that the doped structures have properties that
are of potential applications in nanoelectronics, spintron-
ics, and optoelectronics.
