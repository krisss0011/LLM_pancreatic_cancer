Activity-mediated unjamming transition in confluent systems is crucial for embryogenesis, wound healing,
cancer metastasis, etc. During these processes, the cells progressively change their junction properties, charac-
terized by an interaction parameter 𝑝0, and become motile. How does activity affect this unjamming transition?
Using molecular dynamics simulations of the active Vertex model and analytical mode-coupling theory (MCT),
we show that the nature of the transition in the presence of activity remains similar to that in equilibrium. The
agreement of the simulation results with the MCT predictions demonstrates that the structure-dynamics feed-
back mechanism controls the relaxation dynamics. In addition, we present the first computation of a dynamic
length scale, 𝜉𝑑, and show that the growing relaxation time accompanies an increasing 𝜉𝑑. Furthermore, unlike
particulate glasses, the static length is proportional to 𝜉𝑑. Our results highlight the unique nature of the glassy
dynamics in confluent systems and rationalize the existing experimental data.

INTRODUCTION
Metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients
[1, 2]. It has several steps, where the cancer cells leave their
primary sites, go through the stroma and other tissues, use
the bloodstream, and acclimatize at a secondary site [1, 3–
5]. The primary step of this process is cellular unjamming
[6, 7]. Many past works have shown that an epithelial mono-
layer shows glassy behavior where the system has anomalously
slow dynamics with a stretched exponential relaxation [8, 9],
non-Gaussian displacement distribution [9–11], spatially het-
erogeneous dynamics [8, 12], etc.
During several biologi-
cal processes, such as embryogenesis [13–15], would-healing
[16–19], and cancer progression and metastasis [7, 20–24], the
cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
[25–28].
The epithelial monolayer is primarily sedentary,
where cells show strong cell-cell adhesion and out-of-plane
polarity. By contrast, the cancerous monolayer is dynamic,
where cells show weak cell-cell adhesion, develop in-plane
polarity, and become motile [7, 25, 29]. Although EMT was
thought of as a binary switch between the epithelial and mes-
enchymal states, it is now clear that it is more like a continuum
than a switch [28, 30–32]. At the early stage of EMT, known
as partial EMT or pEMT, the monolayer remains confluent,
although the cells become motile. Cellular motility facilitates
unjamming [7, 33]; a more detailed characterization of the
transition is essential for a deeper understanding of metastasis.
Experiments have shown contrasting results for different
oncogenes. For example, human breast cancer cells MCF-10A
fluidizes by the over-expression of an oncogene, 14 −3 −3𝜁,
or an endocytic protein, RAB5A [23]. However, the same
monolayer solidifies by over-expressing another oncogene
ErbB2/HER-2/neu [10]. A recent work has shown that con-
fluency has a nontrivial effect on activity, where the former
leads to an effective rotational diffusivity, 𝐷eff
𝑟, that is differ-
ent from the intrinsic rotational diffusivity, 𝐷𝑟, of motility

[34]. Thus, how activity will affect the glassy dynamics is
nontrivial. Furthermore, simulations suggest that within the
continuum of pEMT [34, 35], during the initial times when
cellular junctions are relatively strong, the monolayer shows
super-Arrhenius relaxation. Conversely, at a later time, when
junctions become weaker, the monolayer shows sub-Arrhenius
relaxation. In this work, we focus on this later regime. Using
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the active Ver-
tex model and an analytical theory, the mode-coupling theory
(MCT) of glasses [36–38], we investigate the effects of motil-
ity on the unjamming transition. What is the specific nature
of this transition? How does the dynamics of a monolayer
with pEMT differ from that of the epithelial states? Does the
structure-dynamics correlation of confluent epithelial systems
[39–41] survive even under motility?
We have simulated the athermal active vertex model with
the energy function H (see supplementary material (SM), Sec.
S1 for details),
H =
𝑁
∑︁
𝑖=1
[𝜆𝐴(𝑎𝑖−𝑎0)2 + 𝜆𝑃(𝑝𝑖−𝑝0)2],
(1)
where 𝑁is the total number of cells; 𝑎𝑖and 𝑝𝑖are the area
and perimeter of the 𝑖th cell; 𝑎0 and 𝑝0 are the target area and
target perimeter; 𝜆𝐴and 𝜆𝑃are two elastic constants [9, 42–
44].
𝑝0 parameterizes the intercellular interaction and is a
control parameter of dynamics. We have taken a 50 : 50 binary
mixture with 𝑎0𝛼= 0.8 and 𝑎0𝛽= 1.2 to avoid crystallization,
and designate the system via 𝑝0 = 𝑝0𝛼/√𝑎0𝛼= 𝑝0𝛽/√𝑎0𝛽.
We simulate the system via molecular dynamics in the over-
damped regime with friction 𝜇= 1 (see SM). We implement
activity by assigning each vertex 𝑘with a self-propulsion force
f𝑘
𝑎= 𝑓0 ˆn𝑘, where ˆn𝑘= (cos 𝜙𝑘, sin 𝜙𝑘) gives the direction and
𝑓0 is the strength. The angle, 𝜙𝑘, performs a random walk
with persistence time 𝜏𝑝= 1/𝐷𝑟. We use √𝑎0 as the unit of
length, where 𝑎0 is the average area, and 1/𝜆𝐴𝜇𝑎0 is the unit
of time.
To take advantage of the effective equilibrium scenario at
small 𝜏𝑝, we fix 𝐷𝑟= 1/𝜏𝑝= 1 and study the properties
with varying 𝑓0 [45–47]. Since we set 𝜇= 1, 𝑓0 is numeri-

cally the same as the self-propulsion velocity, 𝑣0. We present
the results in terms of 𝑣0 using 𝑣2
0 in place of temperature 𝑇
to characterize the transition. Reference [41] has shown that
MCT works surprisingly well for epithelial systems. Here, we
take a similar approach. We test the applicability of the MCT
by comparing the relaxation dynamics with the MCT predic-
tions. We show that MCT remains valid even in the presence
of activity; thus, the structure-dynamics correlation holds, and
the feedback mechanism of MCT controls the dynamics. The
relaxation time, 𝜏, diverges with the same exponent, 𝛾= 3/2,
as in equilibrium [41]; this indicates that the relaxation dy-
namics remains equilibrium-like, much like that in particulate
active systems at small 𝜏𝑝[9, 46–49]. In addition, we present
the first computations of the dynamic length scale, 𝜉𝑑, in con-
fluent systems. 𝜉𝑑also diverges at the critical point, and the
increasing 𝜏accompanies a growing 𝜉𝑑.

RESULTS
We characterize the dynamics via the self-intermediate scat-
tering function, 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡), defined as
𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) = ⟨˜𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡)⟩=
1

where, 𝑘is the magnitude of the wave-vector k, 𝑁𝛼, the num-
ber of cells with target area 𝑎0𝛼, r𝑖, the centre of mass of the 𝑖th
cell. The angular brackets denote the ensemble and time aver-
aging. We consider only the 𝛼-particles for the calculation of
𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) [50, 51]. We present the results for the 𝑘correspond-
ing to the first peak of the structure factor. Figure 1(a) shows
the decay of 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) for various values of 𝑣0. The inset of Fig.
1(a) shows the mean square displacement, Δ𝑟2(𝑡), defined as
Δ𝑟2(𝑡) =

The characteristic two-step decay of 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) is evident at lower
values of 𝑣0.
Similarly, Δ𝑟2(𝑡) also shows a sub-diffusive
behavior at intermediate times and becomes diffusive at long
3
times (inset of Fig. 1a).
We define the relaxation time, 𝜏, as 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝜏) = 0.3. MCT
predicts a power law divergence of 𝜏in thermal systems as the
temperature 𝑇tends towards a critical value. Translating this
result for active systems at small 𝜏𝑝, we obtain
𝜏= 𝐴(𝑣2
0 −𝑣2
𝑐)−𝛾,
(4)
where 𝑣𝑐is the MCT critical point, 𝐴is a constant, and 𝛾
is a universal exponent. We obtain 𝜏in our simulation with
varying 𝑣0 for several values of 𝑝0. For a particular 𝑝0, we
fit the data of 𝜏as a function of 𝑣0 with Eq. (4) and obtain
𝐴, 𝛾, and 𝑣𝑐. We show these fits for several values of 𝑝0 in
Fig. 1(b). We find that 𝐴= 0.71 and 𝛾= 3/2 remain constant
for various 𝑝0 in the regime of our interest here. Figure 1(c)
shows the plot of ln 𝜏as a function ln(𝑣2
0 −𝑣2
𝑐): Eq.
(4)
shows that this should be a straight line with slope −3/2 (solid
line).
The simulation data agree remarkably well with the
MCT prediction, Eq. (4). Much like any critical theory, the
critical point depends on the system parameters. In the context
of the vertex model, 𝑝0 parametrizes the interaction potential;
therefore, we expect 𝑣𝑐to vary with changing 𝑝0. Figure 1(d)
shows that 𝑣𝑐monotonically decreases as 𝑝0 increases. We
emphasize that although 𝑣𝑐changes with 𝑝0, the exponent 𝛾in
Eq. (4) remains constant; this is consistent with the universal
prediction of the theory. In addition, MCT predicts power-
law decay of 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) around the plateau (𝛽-regime), and the
simulation results are consistent with these predictions (see
SM, Sec. S2).
We have also computed the effective diffusion constant,
𝐷eff, as the ratio of self-diffusivity and free diffusion con-
stant of an isolated cell.
𝐷eff = 𝐷𝑠/𝐷0 where 𝐷𝑠=
lim𝑡→∞⟨Δ𝑟2(𝑡)⟩/(4𝑡) and 𝐷0 = 𝑣2
0/2𝐷𝑟.
𝐷eff →0 when
𝜏diverges. Fitting the data of 𝐷eff with the power law form of
MCT, 𝐷eff = 𝐴′(𝑣2
0 −𝑣2
𝑐)𝛾′, we obtain the same 𝑣𝑐as from the
data of 𝜏, and 𝛾′ = 1. We show the fit of 𝐷eff for 𝑝0 = 3.78
in Fig. 1(e). Note that the exponent 𝛾in Eq. (4) and 𝛾′ are
different, implying the violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation
(SER) [51–53]. This breakdown is similar to what one finds
in particulate systems, where MCT predicts that SER remains
valid, but simulations show a violation [54] (see however Ref.
[55]). We will explore this breakdown of SER in detail in
a separate work. Finally, we show the Angell plot represen-
tation of 𝜏as a function of 𝑣2
𝑔/𝑣2
0, where we have defined
𝜏(𝑣𝑔) = 103 in Fig. 1(f). Consistent with the agreement of
simulation results with MCT, the relaxation dynamics shows
a sub-Arrhenius behavior [41].
Next, we calculate the four-point susceptibility, 𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡),
defined as the fluctuations in 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡), as follows,
𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡) = 𝑁𝛼[⟨˜𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡)2⟩−⟨˜𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡)⟩2],
(5)
where ˜𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) is defined in Eq. (2). 𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡) gives the mea-
sure of dynamic heterogeneity (DH) in glassy systems. As 𝑡
increases, 𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡) grows from zero, reaches a maximum, and
then decays to zero at long times. We show the behavior of
𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡) for 𝑘corresponding to the structure factor maximum
and 𝑝0 = 3.78 for various 𝑣0 in Fig. 2(a). As 𝑣0 decreases,

4
increases. The time, 𝑡peak, at
which 𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡) reaches its maximum, gives another measure
of the relaxation time. Typically, one finds 𝑡peak ∝𝜏[9, 56];
Fig. 2(b) shows that this relation holds for the active Vertex
model. Furthermore, 𝜒peak
4
gives a measure of the correla-
tion volume.
Figure 2(a) shows that 𝜒peak

increases as 𝑣0
decreases. We compare 𝜒peak
4
with the power-law prediction
of MCT: 𝜒peak

𝑐)−𝛿. The simulation data shows that
𝜒peak
4
also diverges at the same 𝑣𝑐with 𝛿= 1/4. We show the
fit for 𝑝0 = 3.78 in Fig. 2(c); the behavior for other values of
𝑝0 remains similar.
How does 𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡) behave at constant activity but varying
𝑝0? Figure 2(d) shows 𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡) at constant 𝑣0 = 0.2 and dif-
ferent values of 𝑝0. Park et al. showed that the monolayers of
both asthmatic and non-asthmatic human bronchial epithelial
cells become more sluggish as they mature with passing days
[8]. As the monolayer matures, the cell-cell junctions become
more firm, leading to a decrease in 𝑝0. In the experiments, it
results in decreasing values of the observed perimeter or the
shape index [8]. Figure 2(d) shows that as 𝑝0 decreases, 𝑡peak
and 𝜒peak
4
increase. These results rationalize the experimental
findings: As the system matures and the junctions become
stronger, the system becomes more sluggish, and the volume
of dynamically heterogeneous regions increases. We can also

obtain the DH length scale, 𝜉𝑑, from the data of 𝜒peak
4
via a
finite size scaling, as we demonstrate below.
Within MCT, the glassy dynamics comes from a genuine
phase transition where 𝜏diverges concomitantly with the di-
vergence of 𝜉𝑑. We first compute 𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡), Eq. (5), for several
system sizes with 𝑁spanning from 𝑁= 100 −1296, for dif-
ferent values of 𝑣0 and 𝑝0 = 3.78.
We show 𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡) for
𝑣0 = 0.12 for different values of 𝑁in Fig. (3a); 𝜒peak
4
grows as
𝑁increases. Figure 3(b) shows 𝜒peak
4
(𝑁, 𝑣0), the peak value
of 𝜒4(𝑘, 𝑡) for specific values of 𝑁and 𝑣0, as a function of 𝑁
for different values of 𝑣0. 𝜒peak
4
(𝑁, 𝑣0) initially grows with in-
creasing 𝑁and saturates to a 𝑣0-dependent value as 𝑁→∞.
This behavior indicates the presence of a length scale, 𝜉𝑑;
𝜒peak
4
(𝑁, 𝑣0) continues to grow with increasing 𝑁when 𝜉𝑑is
larger than the system size and then saturates in the other limit.
According
to
the
finite-size
scaling
hypothesis,
𝜒peak
4
(𝑁, 𝑣0)/𝜒peak
4
(𝑁→∞, 𝑣0) should be a function of
𝑁/𝜉2
𝑑(𝑣0). To extract the correlation length, we find the values
of 𝜉𝑑(𝑣0) for which plots of 𝜒peak
4
(𝑁, 𝑣0)/𝜒peak
4
(𝑁→∞, 𝑣0)
as a function of 𝑁/𝜉2
𝑑(𝑣0)for all 𝑁and 𝑣0 collapse onto a
master curve. Note that in this method, the correlation length
𝜉𝑑(𝑣0) is determined modulo a multiplicative constant: if
data collapse is obtained for a set of 𝜉𝑑(𝑣0), a similar data
collapse would be obtained for 𝑐𝜉𝑑(𝑣0) where 𝑐is a constant.
The data collapse for 𝑝0 = 3.78 is shown in Fig. 3(c), and
the corresponding values of 𝜉𝑑(𝑣0) are shown in the inset of
Fig. 3(c). Following the scaling prediction of inhomogeneous
mode-coupling theory (IMCT) for glassy systems [57] and
using the effective equilibrium nature of our system, we
obtain for our active Vertex model, 𝜉𝑑(𝑣0) ∼(𝑣2
0 −𝑣2
𝑐)−𝜈.
We have fitted 𝜉𝑑as a function of 𝑣2
0 with this power-law
form and obtained the same 𝑣𝑐as before, and 𝜈= 1/2. The
inset of Figure 3(c) shows the plot of log(𝜉𝑑) as a function of
log(𝑣2
0 −𝑣2
𝑐) that follows a straight with the slope 𝜈= 1/2.
The scaling predictions of ordinary critical phenomenon
suggest 𝛿= 𝜈(2 −𝜂) [58]. Using the values of 𝛿and 𝜈, we
obtain 2 −𝜂= 1/2. This value is quite different from the
prediction of IMCT [57] and simulation results for passive
particulate systems [59, 60]. However, the value is reasonable
for a two-dimensional system where the two-point spatial
order-parameter correlation function decays as 1/𝑟𝜂, where
𝑟is the spatial distance.
MCT is a critical theory that
advocates a diverging correlation length, 𝜉𝑑, accompanying
the divergence of 𝜏.
Using the scaling relations for the
individual variables, we obtain 𝜉𝑑∼𝜏1/𝑧where 𝑧= 𝛾/𝜈= 3.
We show the behavior of 𝜉𝑑as a function of 𝜏in Fig. 3(d)
and find the exponent 𝑧≃3.
We have also checked the system-size scaling of the relax-
5
ation time, 𝜏, for the active confluent cell monolayer. It was
found earlier [59] that the system-size dependence of the re-
laxation time in passive particulate systems is governed by a
different correlation length called the static correlation length
𝜉𝑠. To check whether a similar result is obtained for the present
model, we have plotted 𝜏vs. 𝑁for various 𝑣0 as shown in
Fig. (3e). As 𝑁increases, 𝜏decreases and eventually saturates
to a 𝑣0-dependent value. The saturation value increases with
decreasing 𝑣0. The system-size dependence of 𝜏is similar to
that in passive particulate systems [59]. However, it contrasts
with the usual dynamical finite-size scaling close to critical-
ity in which the relaxation time increases with system size.
We find that 𝜏(𝑁, 𝑣0) also exhibits a scaling collapse when
we plot 𝜏(𝑁, 𝑣0)/𝜏(𝑁→∞, 𝑣0) as a function of 𝑁/𝜉2
𝑠(𝑣0),
Fig. (3f), for appropriate choice of {𝜉𝑠(𝑣0)}. As shown in
Fig. (3g), 𝜉𝑠turns out to be proportional to 𝜉𝑑, establishing
that the system-size dependences of 𝜒peak
4
and 𝜏are governed
by the same correlation length (modulo a multiplicative con-
stant). This is analogous to finite-size scaling in usual criti-
cal phenomena but markedly different from the behavior ob-
served in passive glassy systems of particles [59]. As a further
check, we have plotted 𝜒peak
4
(𝑁, 𝑣0)/𝜒peak
4
(𝑁→∞, 𝑣0) vs.
𝜏(𝑁, 𝑣0)/𝜏(𝑁→∞, 𝑣0) in Fig. (3h). The data points for dif-
ferent 𝑣0 and 𝑁fall on the same curve, implying that the same
correlation length governs the system-size dependence of both
𝜒peak
4
and 𝜏. These results establish the existence of a single
growing length scale that describes the growth of fluctuations
and relaxation in the present system.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The activity-mediated unjamming of a cell monolayer is
critical for several biological processes, such as cancer metas-
tasis, embryogenesis, and development.
In the early stage
of EMT, the junction molecules weaken, and cells become
motile. We have studied this regime and shown that the na-
ture of the unjamming transition does not change in the pres-
ence of activity: the structure-dynamics correlation holds, and
dynamics is sub-Arrhenius. We have also characterized the
higher-order correlation functions with changing 𝑝0. As the
system matures, junctions become firm, the dynamics becomes
progressively sluggish, and the length scale, 𝜉𝑑, and the DH
volume, 𝜒peak
4
, increases. Our results rationalize the existing
experiments on confluent cell monolayers [8]. We have also
shown that a growing length scale governs the growth of DH
and the relaxation time and have obtained the exponents that
characterize the divergence of these quantities.
The structure-dynamics correlation has crucial significance.
Many past works have demonstrated a remarkable correlation
of cell shape with cellular functions, such as division plane
orientation [61–63], cell growth or apoptosis [64], stem cell
lineage [65, 66], and differentiation [67, 68]. In particular, cell
division and apoptosis will affect the monolayer dynamics by
cutting off the relaxation time [69–71]. Thus, the structure-
dynamics correlation of confluent monolayers is consistent
with these findings. Yet, cancer cells exhibit an intricate prop-
erty: they avoid the inherent defense mechanism of cell ex-
trusion and apoptosis and continue to divide [3, 72]. Does
this have a structural signature at the level of cell shape? Cell
extrusion requires the organization of the forces and displace-
ments. Therefore, comparing cell shapes between extruding
and non-extruding cancerous cells can be instructive.
Our
work demonstrating the survival of the quantitative nature of
the structure-dynamics correlation in the presence of activity
is a first step in this direction.
Beyond the biological relevance, confluent models are also
intriguing due to their fascinating physics properties. Their
glassy dynamics seems better suited for MCT [41, 73]. We
have shown that 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) follows the time-temperature super-
position principle of MCT (see SM), 𝜏follows the power-law
prediction with the same exponent as in equilibrium systems,
and 𝜒peak
4
also diverges as a power law at the same critical
point. Furthermore, we present the first computation of the
dynamic length scale, 𝜉𝑑, in confluent systems via a finite-size
scaling analysis [59]. We find that 𝜉𝑑∼𝜏1/3; this is consistent
with the critical nature of MCT, where the diverging time scale
accompanies the divergence of a length scale. Interestingly,
our results show that (2 −𝜂) = 1/2; this is much smaller than
the values obtained in both MCT and simulations of passive
particulate systems. We have also computed a static length, 𝜉𝑠,
and found that 𝜉𝑑is proportional to 𝜉𝑠. This result suggests
that, unlike particulate systems [59], a unique length scale
governs the dynamics.

Model and Simulation Details
The effective energy function of a single-component confluent monolayer is
H =
𝑁
∑︁
𝑖=1
[𝜆𝐴(𝑎𝑖−𝑎0)2 + 𝜆𝑃(𝑝𝑖−𝑝0)2],
(S1)
where 𝑁is the total number of cells. 𝑎𝑖and 𝑝𝑖are the area and the perimeter of the 𝑖th cell. 𝑎0 and 𝑝0 are the target area and
perimeter of the cells. As stated in the main text, we have taken a 50:50 binary mixture with an average area 𝑎0 = 1. The cell
cytoplasm can be treated as an incompressible fluid [74], and the monolayer height remains nearly constant [43]. These two
properties lead to the area constraint with a strength 𝜆𝐴, the first term in Eq. (S1). On the other hand, the second term in Eq. (S1)
is a combination of two terms: the linear term in 𝑝𝑖is a result of the cell-cell adhesion and the cortical tension, and the quadratic
term in 𝑝𝑖signifies the actomyosin contractility. 𝑎0 = 1 sets the length scale of the system.
Given the energy function, Eq. (S1), we now need a model of confluent systems. Several such models exist to study the static
and dynamic properties. Examples include, the cellular Potts model (CPM) [75–77], Vertex [44, 78, 79] and Voronoi models
[33, 80], Phase field models [81–83] etc. For this study, we have used the active athermal Vertex model (AVM). We have used
molecular dynamics simulation by integrating the over-damped equation of motion for each vertex 𝑙given by,
𝑑r𝑙
𝑑𝑡= 𝜇−1
F𝑙+ ˜f𝑙
𝑖

,
(S2)
where 𝜇is the friction, set to 1, F𝑙= −∇𝑙H is the force due to the energy function in Eq. (1). ˜f𝑙
𝑖is the active force acting on vertex
𝑙of the 𝑖th cell: ˜f𝑙
𝑖= 𝑣0
3
Í
𝑗∈N(𝑙) ˆn𝑗, where N (𝑙) is the number of all neighbouring cells sharing vertex 𝑙and ˆn𝑖= (cos 𝜙𝑖, sin 𝜙𝑖).
𝜙𝑖(𝑡) is the angle of the motile force with the x-axis. It performs a random rotational diffusion with a diffusion constant 𝐷𝑟,
𝜕𝑡𝜙𝑖(𝑡) =
√︁
2𝐷𝑟𝜂𝑖(𝑡),
(S3)
where, 𝜂𝑖is a Gaussian white noise with zero mean and variance ⟨𝜂𝑖(𝑡)𝜂𝑗(𝑡′)⟩= 𝛿(𝑡−𝑡′)𝛿𝑖𝑗. 𝐷𝑟is proportional to the inverse of
the persistence time 𝜏𝑝. We have used the Euler-Murayama integration scheme to evolve the vertices. We have averaged the data
over 100 time-origins and 32 ensembles. We have used a binary 50 : 50 mixture of cells to avoid crystallization. This binary
system is designated by 𝑝0 given by: 𝑝0 = 𝑝0𝛼/√𝑎0𝛼= 𝑝0𝛽/√𝑎0𝛽. We show a typical snapshot of our system in Fig. S1.

FIG. S1. A typical snapshot from our simulations of the self-propelled Vertex model. We have associated color to each cell according to its
target area 𝑎0𝛼or 𝑎0𝛽. The arrows denote their instantaneous velocity direction.
FIG. S2. Test of the MCT prediction for the 𝛽-relaxation of 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡). Symbols are the plot of 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) for 𝑝0 = 3.78, 𝑣0 = 0.06 and 𝐷𝑟= 1.
We have separately fitted the early and late 𝛽-regimes with Eq. (S5) (black and red lines). We obtain the parameters as follows: 𝑓= 0.52,
𝐴= 1.63, and 𝑎= 0.395 for the early 𝛽-regime and 𝑓= 0.593, 𝐵= 1.96 × 10−7, and 𝑏= 0.99 for the late 𝛽-regime.
S2.
Determination of MCT Scaling Exponents: 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝛾
As discussed in the main text, we characterized the dynamics via the two-point self-intermediate scattering function, 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡),
𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) = ⟨˜𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡)⟩=
1
𝑁𝛼
⟨
𝑁𝛼
∑︁
𝑖=1
exp[𝑖k.(r𝑖(0) −r𝑖(𝑡))]⟩.
(S4)
S3
For our binary system, we could define two different 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡), one for each type of particle. They contain the same information
[50]. Here, we present the results for only the 𝛼-particles. We have chosen 𝑘≃𝑘m𝑎𝑥, the wavevector corresponding to the
maximum of the static structure factor. We have obtained the relaxation time 𝜏when 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) decays to 0.3.
MCT predicts that 𝜏diverges as a power law with an exponent 𝛾. For an athermal active system 𝑇∼𝑣2
0 and the relation
modifies as 𝜏∝(𝑣2
0 −𝑣2
𝑐)−𝛾. 𝛾is obtained by fitting the data in experiments and simulations. MCT also predicts a power-law
decay for the 𝛽-regime. The early and late 𝛽-regimes of 𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) are characterized by two exponents, 𝑎and 𝑏:
𝐹𝑠(𝑘, 𝑡) =
(
𝑓+ 𝐴𝑡−𝑎,
for early 𝛽-regime,
𝑓−𝐵𝑡𝑏,
for late 𝛽-regime.
(S5)
where 𝑓, 𝐴, and 𝐵are constants [36, 84]. Close to the MCT transition point, 𝑎and 𝑏are related as,
Γ2(1 −𝑎)
Γ(1 −2𝑎) = Γ2(1 + 𝑏)
Γ(1 + 2𝑏) ,
(S6)
where Γ is the Gamma function. Furthermore, MCT also predicts a relation between 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝛾:
𝛾= 1
2𝑎+ 1
2𝑏.
(S7)
We have tested this prediction of MCT. Figure (S2) shows the fit with the data for 𝑝0 = 3.78 and 𝑣0 = 0.06. We find that the
values of 𝑎and 𝑏remain nearly constant: 𝑎= 0.395 and 𝑏= 0.99. Using these values, we find that Eq. (S6) is valid up to the
second order. In addition, we obtain 𝛾= 1.77 from Eq. (S7). This value is slightly higher than that obtained from the relaxation
time data.
