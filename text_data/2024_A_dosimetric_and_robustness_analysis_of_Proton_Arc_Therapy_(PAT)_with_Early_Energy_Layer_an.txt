1. Introduction  
Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) holds promise as a superior choice for radiation 
treatment in the lung, in comparison with photon-based techniques [1][2][3]. This is primarily 
attributed to its enhanced dose conformity and absence of exit dose, resulting in improved 
sparing of organs at risk (OAR). However, IMPT raises significant challenges in treating 
moving targets [1][4][5], due to the Bragg peak sensitivity to density changes and interplay 
effect between breathing and the scanned beam. 
 
Proton arc therapy (PAT), a cutting-edge technique that emerges as an alternative to IMPT, 
involves rotating the proton beam around the patient, either continuously (i.e., dynamic 
modality)[6] [7] or in a step-and-shoot fashion (i.e., static) [8]. The availability of more degrees 
 
2 
 
of freedom for treatment planning enables potentially superior dose distribution and simplified 
treatment delivery workflow. However, the total amount of energy layers (ELs) in the plan must 
be limited to avoid too long and unfeasible treatment plan deliveries. As a result, prior energy 
layer selection and filtration algorithms have been proposed to address this issue [6] [9] [10] 
[11] [12], among which the early energy layer and spot assignment algorithm (ELSA), 
integrated into the commercial treatment planning system (TPS) RayStation (RaySearch 
Laboratories, Stockholm) [7] ELSA selects a single energy layer (EL) per beam direction from 
a predetermined set of ELs. Once the optimal EL set is determined, spots are exclusively 
assigned to those layers, reducing the number of spots to be optimized and thereby 
decreasing optimization time. 
 
Some planning studies showed a potential benefit for PAT. First, it could preserve target 
coverage while enhancing dose conformity and OARs sparing [13][14][15], especially for small 
structures close to the target volume. Second, PAT could achieve a lower body integral dose 
[13][15][16][17]. Third, PAT could reduce both beam delivery time (BDT) and total treatment 
time (TTT) due to a simplified treatment workflow. This workflow eliminates the need for couch 
rotations, manual intervention from technicians to rotate the gantry, and manual beam loading. 
Additionally, the continuous gantry motion and the absence of lag time between beams 
contribute to the reduced treatment time. The increased degrees of freedom in PAT could 
potentially help to improve conformity and  better meet clinical objectives. Regarding PAT plan 
robustness and treatment uncertainties, several studies highlight the importance of a 
comprehensive robustness analysis for moving tumors [13][14][17][18], in order to evaluate 
the impact of setup and range uncertainties, acknowledging interplay effects as well. 
 
This study aims to comprehensively analyze potential dosimetric differences and plan 
robustness in ELSA-based PAT versus conventional IMPT for lung cancer. We use ELSA to 
create PAT plans and compare them to their IMPT counterparts, in terms of plan quality, 
normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP), plan robustness against setup and range 
 
3 
 
uncertainties, and beam delivery time. Additionally, we present results of interplay simulations 
for both modalities, assessing how intrafraction movement can affect dose coverage on CTV 
during IMPT and PAT delivery.  
2. Methods and materials 
2.1 Patient cohort 
A retrospective database of 14 patients with unresectable lung cancer was used. More 
information can be found in Table SM1. For each patient, a PAT plan and a conventional IMPT 
plan were created (See section 2.3).  
2.2 Imaging and target delineation 
For each patient, a 4D-CT scan containing 10 phases was acquired. Regular breathing was 
ensured through audio-coaching [19]. The time-weighted mid position (MidP) image was 
reconstructed from the 4D-CT scan, using in-house software (REGGUI) [20], and  chosen as 
the planning image[21]. More details about image acquisition, patient immobilization, and 
MidPCT reconstruction can be found in [19][22]. 
The gross tumor volume (GTV) was manually delineated by the same radiation oncologist on 
the MidPCT, while the clinical tumor volume (CTV) was created as an isotropic 5 mm 
expansion of the GTV [23]. Phases such as end inhale (EndInh), end exhale (EndExh) and 
mid ventilation (MidV) were extracted from the 4D-CT image series. 
2.3 Treatment Planning strategy  
PAT plans were designed on RayStation research version 12B. Patient-specific IMPT plans 
had been previously generated on RayStation 11B for all patients to be used in a prior study 
[23]. Some of them were updated to include improvements on spinal canal and target 
 
4 
 
coverage robustness. All IMPT plans contained 3 beams, placed  according to the patient's 
tumor extension and location. Only one patient needed a range shifter. 
PAT plans were created using one arc per plan, and only one revolution around the patient. 
We chose to use between 1 and 2 degrees as gantry angle spacing, depending on the beam 
range and amount of total energy layers desired. No range shifter was needed in any case. 
The TPS allowed us to choose the contralateral lung as a region to be avoided when placing 
ELs, so this tool was used when possible. Table SM3 contains further planning details.  
For both modalities, 4D worst-case minimax robust optimization[24] was performed on a non 
isotropic CTV expansion, according to Van Herk’s formula [25]. Different margins were 
calculated, depending on the presence or absence of affected lymph nodes.  
Although it is well-known that margin recipes fail in proton therapy [26], converting 
uncertainties into errors in robust optimization is a widely used and pragmatic approach [27]. 
For consistency with the IMPT plans generated beforehand, and following the work of Badiu 
et. al [23], the full non-isotropic setup error was divided into two components: 5 mm (isotropic) 
were included on the RayStation parameter for setup error during robust optimization, while 
the rest of the setup error was accounted for with a non-isotropic CTV expansion. See Table 
SM4 for more details. The same clinical goals, as well as trade-off criteria between OAR 
sparing and target coverage, were applied for both modalities. However, optimization functions 
were specific to the treatment technique. In both cases, robust objective functions concerned 
the CTV expansion only. The optimization included a total of 84 scenarios: 7 setup error 
scenarios (5 mm in 6 different directions, plus nominal case) x 3 range scenarios (± 3% range 
error, plus nominal case) x 4 phases (MidP, EndExh, EndInh, MidV).  
Dose distributions in all plans relied on the Monte Carlo dose calculation engine embedded in 
RayStation. The beam model in use comes from a ProteusPlus machine (IBA s.a.), which 
allows for 360-degree rotation. The dose calculation grid size was 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 𝑚𝑚3. The 
prescription dose was set to 60 Gy in 30 fractions (2Gy/fx), and all plans were normalized to 
D50% = 60 Gy.

2.4 Plan evaluation and comparison 
2.4.1 Robustness Evaluation against motion, setup and range error 
 
4D robustness was evaluated on all plans, including MidP, MidV, End Inhale and End Exhale 
CT scans. Although plan optimization was performed on a CTV expansion (see section 2.3), 
robustness was evaluated on the raw CTV for preciseness, using a non isotropic setup error 
equal to the total non isotropic CTV expansion margin used for optimization. Consistently with 
plan optimization, a 3% range error was used. Considering the four aforementioned phases, 
84 robustness evaluation scenarios were analyzed, equaling the number of scenarios used 
for optimization.  
2.4.2 Dosimetry analysis 
 
IMPT and PAT plans were compared in terms of predefined clinical goals, as shown in Table 
1. 
 
Additionally to relevant CTV and OAR metrics, we computed the homogeneity and conformity 
index (HI, CI) for the target in the nominal case, as well as body integral dose (ID). The 
definitions for these metrics can be found in the supplemental material (section SM5). 
2.4.3 Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) 
 
NTCPs were calculated as described in the National Indication Protocol of Proton Therapy for 
Lung Carcinoma from The Netherlands for grade ≥ 2 radiation pneumonitis (NTCP 
pneumonitis), grade ≥ 2 acute esophageal toxicity (NTCP dysphagia), and 2 years mortality 
(NTCP 2ym) (see SM6). The detailed NTCP formulas and the clinical parameters involved, 
 
6 
 
such as pulmonary comorbidity, age, or gross tumor volume (GTV) size, can be found in Table 
SM6. The mean heart dose (MHD), mean lung dose (MLD), and mean esophageal dose 
(MED) were the dose metrics involved for NTCP 2ym, NTCP pneumonitis, and NTCP 
dysphagia, respectively. Only the values extracted from the nominal case were used in this 
calculation.  
 
2.4.4 Beam delivery time (BDT) model  
For PAT plans, BDT was estimated using ATOM, a BDT simulator algorithm implemented by 
RaySearch Laboratories [28]. All parameters used for BDT calculation using this model can 
be found in Table SM2. For IMPT, a simple start-and-stop trajectory was calculated. While 
human intervention time during IMPT beam delivery was not considered, travel time between 
beams, including couch and gantry rotation, was accounted for. It should be noticed that, to 
this date, a clinically approved model to calculate beam delivery time for arc trajectories has 
not been published.  
 
2.5 Interplay simulation 
Interplay simulation was performed for all patients and both modalities using OpenTPS, an 
open source planning software for research purposes [29]. This software relies on MCsquare, 
an open-source Monte Carlo dose engine for pencil beam scanning [30].  
Interplay effect simulation involves a 4D dynamic dose (4DDD) computation process, which 
requires the 4D-CT phase series, the contours, and the treatment plan (Figure 5). Each 
simulation starts in a particular phase, and we assume a regular breathing pattern. Details on 
the process can be found in Figure 1. Using one different starting phase every time, we 
obtained a total of 10 scenarios per patient, which can then be used to evaluate the interplay 
effect created by the starting phase variation. 
 
7 
 
The DVH-band method [4] was chosen to measure plan robustness, by computing bandwidths 
from perturbed scenarios for CTV D98% and CTV D1% metrics. The narrower the DVH band, 
the more robust the treatment plan would be (see Figure 6). Beforehand, plans were 
normalized to D50% = prescription and checked for clinical goal compliance in the nominal 
case.  
 
2.6 Statistical considerations 
In the statistical evaluation of setup and range uncertainties, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in 
the Python scipy library was used. This test is suitable for a small patient population like ours. 
Differences were considered non significant if the p-values exceeded 0.05. For interplay effect 
evaluation, straightforward comparison of bandwidth values was performed, alongside 
standard deviation calculation for every treatment technique. 
3.  Results 
3.1 Target coverage and organs at risk 
CTV D95% and D98% (Figure 2b) showed no statistical difference (p > 0.05) in the nominal 
case, meaning that both PAT and IMPT can achieve acceptable target coverage. In fact, both 
plans complied with the clinical goal for the target. Regarding hot spots in the CTV, revealed 
by  D1%, the techniques did not differ significantly, although the median difference is bigger 
for PAT plans. In the worst case scenario, CTV D98% showed a wider spread among patients 
for PAT plans (Figure 2c). However, the median difference with IMPT is negligible (p >> 0.05) 
and below 1%. In the case of CTV D95%, there is a statistically significant difference (p=0.05) 
in favor of IMPT, with a median value across all patients equal to 57.9 Gy, against 57.71 Gy 
for PAT. Nevertheless,  the difference is not clinically relevant (< 0.2 Gy), thus allowing PAT 
plans to preserve target coverage as accurately as IMPT, given the clinical goal for this metric. 
 
8 
 
As for CTV D1%, our results indicate that high dose spots appear more likely in PAT plans for 
all the patients, but with a significant statistical difference of 1 Gy only (p << 0.05). Although 
the HI index did not show any difference between the two treatment modalities, PAT proved 
to achieve a higher conformality than IMPT by 66% (p = 0.00012). 
Regarding the nominal case, PAT plans do not seem to outperform IMPT for any OAR metric 
median difference, The only significant statistical difference is observed for the heart mean 
dose (HMD), with PAT plans delivering a higher dose to this organ (23% increased median, p 
=0.00012). Although spinal canal median D0.04cc in PAT plans is slightly over the one 
delivered by IMPT, the results are still comparable (p >> 0.05). None of the 28 plans surpasses 
the clinical goal for this metric. As for the body, PAT plans presented a smaller D1cc (p = 
0.0017), though there is hardly a 1 Gy difference with IMPT. On the contrary, PAT plans 
showed an increased body integral dose (see Table SM7a) of 10.62 Gy.cc (p = 0.00085) when 
compared with IMPT. 
Looking at the worst-case scenario, the esophagus D0.04cc and HMD exhibit a statistically 
significant difference in favor of IMPT (p < 0.05). However, the analysis of V30% for healthy 
lung tissue reveals a reduction in radiation dosage for PAT for the majority of patients (Figure 
2c), with a median difference of approximately 2 Gy (p = 0.025). Although the Spinal Canal 
does comply with the clinical goal in the worst case scenario for both modalities, the mean of 
the differences between PAT and IMPT for D 0.04cc presents a non- relevant increase of 3% 
(p > 0.05) in detriment of PAT.  
 
3.2 NTCP analysis 
In Figure 3, we illustrate the deviation of NTCP values (△NTCP) from PAT plans in comparison 
with IMPT for three types of complications: pneumonitis, dysphagia, and 2-year mortality, 
which are influenced by the mean doses (in the nominal case) for the lung, esophagus, and 
heart, respectively (see SM6). As anticipated from the OAR metric results in Figure 2b, NTCP 
 
9 
 
for 2-year mortality increases by 2% (p=0.00012) compared to conventional IMPT. NTCP for 
pneumonitis and dysphagia of grade 2 also showed approximately a 1% increase with PAT, 
although without statistical significance.  
 
3.3 BDT 
The total BDTs for all patients and both modalities are reported in Figure 4, along with their 
mean values for both modalities (dashed lines). Figure 4 shows that, on average, PAT 
achieves a slightly shorter BDT, although the difference fails to reach statistical significance 
(p>0.05) and clinical relevance: PAT mean BDT equals 216.6 seconds versus 227.5 seconds 
for IMPT. This difference considers the previously defined beam travel time for IMPT as well, 
which accounts for 55 to 90 seconds maximum (Patient 12). This is not present for arc 
treatments since there is no lagging time for dynamic arc dose delivery.     
 
3.4 Interplay effect evaluation 
When analyzing the DVH bandwidths for CTV (Figure 6), D1% bandwidth for PAT plans 
showed to be slightly larger than for IMPT plans, with a wider data spreading (1.1 土 1.4 Gy 
for PAT vs 1,0 土 0.8 for IMPT), hence indicating IMPT plans are more robust when 
considering high doses within the target. Similarly, PAT showed decreased plan robustness 
when analyzing target coverage after interplay simulation, with D98% bandwidth = (1.1 土 1.3) 
Gy vs (0.9土0.9) Gy for IMPT.  
Discussion  
 
 
10 
 
Dynamic-ELSA PAT treatment plans yielded clinically acceptable dose distributions, with 
adequate robustness against setup/range errors and the interplay effect. Compared to IMPT, 
ELSA-based PAT improved dose conformity but did not outperform the latter for other metrics. 
Regarding robustness against setup and range errors, target coverage (D98%) was better 
preserved as anticipated by Seco et al. [31] due to the presence of more irradiation directions. 
However, if we consider OAR sparing, ELSA PAT plans were less robust than IMPT, as 
observed in the heart or the esophagus (see Figure 2). A feasible explanation is that these 
organs were in the path of several beams traversing lung tissue, impacting robustness 
because of beam passage through density interfaces, all those beams contributing to the total 
dose distribution. An alternative to improve robustness could be discrete-arc (instead of 
dynamic) sub plans. This methodology was successfully tested on head and neck cancer [32], 
showing enhanced robustness. However, further validation is required in thoracic target areas 
where breathing motion has a higher impact.  
 
A yet unexplored aspect is the use of PTV margins instead of robust optimization, as we 
assumed that conventional margin recipes may fail due to range uncertainties [26]. This 
assumption particularly matters when using a few beam directions. However, for wide-angle 
or full proton arcs, where the range uncertainty is distributed across multiple directions, the 
effectiveness of PTV-based optimization may not be ruled out. Further research could 
evaluate the effectiveness of PTV-based versus robust optimization approaches specifically 
for proton arcs. 
 
The interplay effect was assessed by computing the differences between 10 scenarios per 
patient and plan. We did not perform a multi fraction dose analysis to observe if this effect was 
lessened by simulating multiple fractions in a whole treatment. Ideally, we would expect the 
dose delivered in each fraction to be homogeneous within planning requirements. However, 
our results showed dose inhomogeneities within a single fraction of the treatment. 
Consequently, PAT proved to be less robust against interplay, compared to IMPT, not only in 
 
11 
 
terms of target coverage but also regarding hotspot management, with around half of the 
patient cohort complying with D98% clinical goal for both techniques. 
 
The interplay simulation relies on a regular breathing pattern by means of patient audio-
coaching. Implementing breath hold techniques, coupled with visual coaching of the 
respiratory signal, could improve treatment accuracy. This approach could stabilize the target 
position, reducing the interplay for PAT or even ruling it out, provided the patient can hold their 
breath for long enough for the gantry to complete its rotation. While it may be easier to 
implement in IMPT due to its more straightforward beam delivery, advancements in arc proton 
therapy could also adopt these techniques, in order to possibly synchronize breathing motion 
with gantry acceleration and deceleration .  
 
The result obtained here for the HMD should be acknowledged, since it is increased by 23% 
for PAT in the nominal case (1.4 Gy median difference). On one hand, our result is coherent 
with the one obtained in a similar previous study [18], where the authors also report a PAT-
attributed increased HMD. On the other hand, a compromise between contralateral lung and 
heart sparing had to be made while planning, given the heart proximity to the target (see Figure 
2a). While some planning resources were used to spare it as much as possible, we were 
limited by hotspot presence. Nevertheless, PAT complies perfectly with the heart clinical dose, 
not exceeding 20 Gy as mean dose in any case.  
 
Some studies [33][34] have suggested that high total energy deposited in healthy tissues could 
contribute to the development of secondary cancers and may be a good estimator for 
quantifying cancer induction. Consequently, the presence of low-dose regions could imply 
higher risk of secondary malignancies. Although some studies have reported a decrease in 
integral dose when delivering PAT for target locations such as head and neck [35], as well as 
breast [17], the results obtained in this article showed a 17% increase when treating lung 
tumors using ELSA-based PAT. Therefore, this substantial increase may not apply to all target 
 
12 
 
locations and may also depend on the degrees of freedom that the optimiser can explore to 
reduce low body doses as much as possible.  
 
In a recent review article, Mazal et al. stated that comparing PAT with current standard 
modalities by looking at dosimetry alone is not enough [36], and that plan evaluation should 
involve clinical end-points in addition to analyzing dose metrics.  Such an assessment plays a 
pivotal role in informed decision making between the available  treatment options [37]. By 
quantifying and comparing the NTCP differences between the two examined techniques, we 
could assess the potential of ELSA PAT treatments to mitigate the risk of normal tissue 
toxicities. 
 
PAT yielded in general worse outcomes for pneumonitis,dysphagia and mortality two years 
post-treatment for our patient cohort, although statistical significance has been reached for 
the latter only. The increase in HMD was translated immediately as a 2% (p = 0.00012 ) 
increment in NTCP-2 year mortality, since the model chosen depends strongly on this metric.  
A different heart toxicity model could be used for comparison, such as the one mentioned in  
[38]. According to this article, the 1.4 Gy median difference increase on HMD for our cohort 
would cause a 10.4% increase in the rate of major coronary events. Taking both results into 
consideration, and in the context of clinical decision, IMPT would be chosen over PAT for our 
patient group.  
 
The timing aspect plays a crucial role in clinical proton therapy, with shorter BDT contributing 
to improved patient comfort, reducing uncertainties in treatment (such as intrafraction motion), 
and ultimately boosting patient throughput. From Figure 4, we can observe that there are 7 
patients (patient 1,2,4,6,8,9 and 13) for which PAT associated BDT is shorter than for IMPT. 
For all patients except for patient 13, shorter BDT could be related to these plans containing 
fewer energy layers and spots than their IMPT counterpart (see Table SM8). These patients 
also presented less complex target location and shape, resulting in less complex plans. Given 
 
13 
 
that ELSA energy layer placement depends solely on geometry, this fact could have helped 
the optimization algorithm to place energy layers more efficiently. Moreover, the remaining 
patients with larger BDT for PAT present a higher number of EL and/or spots when compared 
to IMPT (min 6%, max 47%). Considering the whole cohort, very similar results were obtained 
in terms of BDT for both modalities, with only a 11 seconds mean advantage of PAT over 
IMPT. However, if we sum up the time for user interactions, software communications, and 
security checks performed during IMPT in standard practice, PAT BDT would show a bigger 
gap. PAT does not require user intervention and performs security checks just once at the 
start of the arc delivery, hence leading to shorter total treatment time. 
 
Ultimately, a hybrid treatment approach could be considered for lung cancer treatment, 
combining the best features from IMPT and PAT. IMPT can deliver some treatment fractions, 
focusing on target control, plan robustness, and decreasing the low dose bath. Meanwhile, 
other fractions could use PAT to achieve high target dose conformity and effective use of 
degrees of freedom, potentially improving OAR sparing. 
  
Conclusion 
Although ELSA-based PAT does not outperform conventional IMPT for lung cancer in general, 
it shows improved target dose conformality while preserving plan quality, although robustness 
is diminished in the context of non-gated regular breathing assumed in this study. The chosen 
planning methodology and target proximity to the heart could have contributed to a detriment 
in the cohort's 2 year mortality due to a substantial increase in the mean dose. The total 
amount of spots and ELs needed to cover the target efficiently in PAT plans contributes to the 
small difference in BDT when compared with IMPT, although the lack of beam off and beam 
switching time for PAT could contribute to enhanced treatment workflow.

scenarios.  
 
 
 
Figure 1. The interplay simulation process in OpenTPS involves utilizing a 4D-CT phase series, contours, and a 
plan for simulation. Initially, it calculates the timings for delivering proton pencil beam spots given a certain 
treatment plan and starting phase. Subsequently, the spots in the plan are distributed over the different phases 
according to the delivery time structure, until the total number of spots have been delivered . The resulting partial 
dose per phase is computed and then  deformed back to the MidPCT image with non-rigid registration. The final 
outcome involves the summation of all such deformed partial doses, namely, the accumulated dose on MidP. The 
 
19 
 
process is repeated for all phases, where the simulation on each starting phase constitutes one scenario in the 
interplay simulation, giving a total of 10 scenarios

Figure 3. Normal tissue complication probabilities comparison for IMPT and PAT plans. Three types of toxicities 
are considered: pneumonitis, 2 year mortality and dysphagia grade 2. There is no statistical difference for lung and 
esophagus toxicities, while 2 year mortality (related to HMD) is increased for PAT plans (p = 0.00012) 
 
 
Figure 4. Beam Delivery time comparison between IMPT (blue bars) and PAT (orange bars) plans. Travel time in 
between beams for IMPT is shown as superimposed dashed bars, while mean IMPT/PAT BDT values are 
 
21 
 
represented by blue and red dashed lines, respectively. Beam delivery time for PAT is mostly similar to IMPT (216.6 
s vs 227.5 s, p > 0.05). Notice that PAT travel time does not appear in the plot, since it is always zero.

Supplementary material SM4. CTV Margin calculation for robust 
optimization 
 
Maximum setup errors were calculated using systematic (Σ) and random (σ) setup and 
baseline shift values were used for two cases: tumor only and tumor with lymph nodes. This 
was done using van Herk’s margin formula (1) with the goal of obtaining a margin that ensures 
a minimum dose is delivered to 90% of the patient population: 
 
 
𝑴𝑷𝑻𝑽 =  𝟐. 𝟓𝜮𝒕𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 +  𝟎. 𝟕𝝈𝒕𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍  (𝟏)  
 
 
25 
 
 
Table SM4.1 Setup errors for the case with only primary tumor 
 
 
 
 
Table SM4.2 Setup errors for the case with primary tumor and lymph nodes 
 
The calculated total setup error values for each direction were inputted in our treatment 
planning system (TPS), RayStation. However, using a margin that exceeds 5 mm in 
RayStation leads to a significant increase in optimization time due to the system automatically 
generating intermediate errors to ensure robust coverage, which can be an over-conservative 
approach. As a workaround, instead of optimizing on the CTV using the full setup error, a 
patient-specific CTV expansion can be generated to account for part of the setup error. From 
the full value of the margin, 5 mm is subtracted (in each direction) and subsequently used as 
an isotropic setup error value. The CTV is then expanded by the remaining amount. For 
instance, for a setup error of 7.71 mm in the sagittal direction, a CTV expansion of 2.71 mm 
was robustly optimized with a setup error of 5 mm (7.71 mm = 2.71 mm in the margin + 5 mm 
in the robust optimization). 
The complete setup margin values can be found in the Appendix (Table SM3.1 and Table 
SM3.2). Optimization was done on the expanded CTV volume to reduce computation time.  
 
The total number of optimization scenarios was 84: 7 (setup errors: ± 5 mm in x,y,z directions, 
additionally the nominal scenario) × 3 (image conversion errors: ±3%, 0%) × 4 (breathing 
phases: MidP, maximum inhale, maximum exhale and an additional mid-ventilation phase).

Supplementary Material SM5. Target homogeneity index (HI), 
conformity index (CI) and body integral dose (ID) definitions for 
IMPT and PAT plan dosimetry assessment 
Target dose homogeneity was evaluated with the Homogeneity index (HI), defined as a slight 
variation of the formula in 1  
 
𝐻𝐼 =
( 𝐷1%−𝐷98 %)
𝐷 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒𝑑.  
 
Target conformity was assessed as well, by means of the Conformity index (CI), defined as 2 
𝐶𝐼 = 
𝑉95% 
𝑉𝑇 , 
where 𝑉95%⬚ is the volume covered by 95% of the prescribed dose, and 𝑉𝑇  is the total 
volume of the target. The body integral dose was assessed as well, defined as 
 
𝐼𝐷 = 𝐷. 𝑉 , 
 
where 𝐷 is the mean dose to the body in Gy, while V is the patient volume in cc.

Table SM8. Plans characteristics: number of beams or arcs, total number of energy layers, energy layer 
switchings, number of spots and beam delivery time results. Abbreviations: IMPT = intensity modulated proton 
therapy, PAT = proton arc therapy, EL = energy layers, ELSU = energy layer switching up, ELSD = energy layer 
switching down, BDT = beam delivery time. * indicate that the PAT plan held a smaller BDT value than the IMPT 
plan.
