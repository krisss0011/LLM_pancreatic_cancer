Abstract—X-ray dark-field imaging is well-suited to visualizing
the health of the lungs because the alveoli create a strong dark-
field signal. However, time-resolved and tomographic (i.e., 4D)
dark-field imaging is challenging, since most x-ray dark-field
techniques require multiple sample exposures, captured while
scanning the position of crystals or gratings. Here, we present
the first in vivo 4D x-ray dark-field lung imaging in mice. This
was achieved by synchronizing the data acquisition process of
a single-exposure grid-based imaging approach with the breath
cycle. The short data acquisition time per dark-field projection
made this approach feasible for 4D x-ray dark-field imaging by
minimizing the motion-blurring effect, the total time required
and the radiation dose imposed on the sample. Images were
captured from a control mouse and from mouse models of muco-
obstructive disease and lung cancer, where a change in the size
of the alveoli was expected. This work demonstrates that the
4D dark-field signal provides complementary information that is
inaccessible from conventional attenuation-based CT images, in
particular, how the size of the alveoli from different parts of the
lungs changes throughout a breath cycle, with examples shown
across the different models. By quantifying the dark-field signal
and relating it to other physical properties of the alveoli, this
technique could be used to perform functional lung imaging that
allows the assessment of both global and regional lung conditions
where the size or expansion of the alveoli is affected.

I. INTRODUCTION
Dark-field imaging is a novel x-ray imaging modality that
has emerged in recent decades. While the attenuation and
phase shift signals originate from how much the x-ray wave-
field is absorbed and phase-shifted by the sample, respectively,
the dark-field signal predominantly arises from the small-
or ultra-small-angle scattering of the x-rays (SAXS/USAXS)
by unresolved sample microstructures. These three signals
provide independent channels of complementary information
about the sample. In particular, the attenuation signal is related
to the imaginary part of the complex refractive index, β [1],
whereas the phase shift signal is related to the real part of
the refractive index decrement, δ [1], and the dark-field signal
is related to the sample microstructure properties such as the
microstructure size, packing density and material.
The dark-field signal has been extracted using a number
of imaging techniques, such as analyzer-based imaging (ABI)
[2], grating interferometry (GI) [3], edge illumination (EI)
[4], [5], speckle-based imaging [6]–[11], propagation-based
imaging (PBI) [12]–[15], and single-grid imaging [16]–[18].
Quantitative dark-field signals have also been successfully
extracted from ABI [19], GI [20]–[24], EI [25] and, recently,
single-grid imaging [26], [27]. The dark-field signal can then
be related to sample properties via quantities such as the
kurtosis of the angular scattering distribution [25], the linear
diffusion coefficient, µd [20]–[22], the correlation length, ξcorr
[23], [24], [28] and the dark-field scattering angle [19], [26],
[27].
An x-ray dark-field signal can be useful in various fields,
including biomedical imaging, materials science and security
screening. Safety or industrial applications include detecting
and/or identifying goods that come in powder forms, such as
drugs or explosives [29], [30], and imaging industrial parts
made from carbon fibres [31]. Some possible biomedical imag-
ing applications include imaging kidney stones of different
compositions and microscopic morphology for classification
[32], [33], imaging breast tissues with microcalcifications
for early detection of cancer [34]–[37], and imaging bones
to diagnose osteoporosis or undisplaced fractures [38], [39].
Several animal studies have also shown that lung diseases that
arXiv:2411.14669v1  [physics.med-ph]  22 Nov 2024
lead to a change in size or structure of the alveoli [19], [40]–
[44] can result in a change in the dark-field signal from the
lungs.
Dark-field imaging of the lungs has attracted particular
attention because the lungs generate a stronger dark-field
signal than any other part of the human body. The lungs
are made up of hundreds of millions of small air sacs called
alveoli, which is where gas exchange occurs. When x-rays
pass through these alveoli, which are not typically resolved
in an x-ray image, they experience multiple refraction and/or
scattering at the interfaces of the alveoli tissue and air. This
scattering of x-rays then gives rise to the dark-field signal,
and depending on the size and the number of alveoli that the
x-rays pass through, the strength of the dark-field signal can
differ [40].
Dark-field lung imaging using grating interferometry has
moved particularly quickly towards clinical application and
has shown promising results. Recently, the diagnostic capabil-
ity of dark-field radiographs has been demonstrated on healthy
individuals [45], COVID-19-pneumonia patients [46], and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with
emphysema [47]. Dark-field lung radiography has also been
shown to perform better than conventional lung radiography
for diagnosing and staging emphysema [48]. A human-sized
prototype grating interferometry Computed Tomography (CT)
system has also been built [49] in preparation for performing
three-dimensional dark-field lung imaging in a clinical setting.
In the case of in vivo small-animal studies, most dark-
field lung imaging has been performed either with images
acquired over several breaths [41], [43], [50], which results in
a motion-blurring effect, or have required the sample to remain
in a breath-hold position [51]. To resolve changes through the
breath, dynamic in vivo dark-field imaging on mice has been
performed with a grating interferometer [52]. In that study, the
mouse was continuously ventilated while the analyser grating
was stepped over 7 positions, so that images taken at different
grating positions (but the same breath point) could be used to
retrieve the dark-field signal projections at each breath point.
However,
a
two-dimensional
projection
of
a
three-
dimensional sample can obscure details and confound pro-
jected thickness with attenuation/dark-field coefficients. This
can be overcome by performing CT using projections collected
at multiple angles to obtain the spatial information missing
from a projection. In particular, a three-dimensional dark-
field image could be useful for diagnosing lung diseases
by revealing the internal structures of the lungs and provid-
ing complementary information that is not accessible from
conventional CT images. Furthermore, by synchronizing the
image acquisition with the breathing/ventilation cycle, a four-
dimensional dark-field image of the lungs can be obtained,
which then allows changes in alveolar dimensions to be
tracked throughout a breath cycle, mapped across each part
of the lungs. This is a type of functional imaging of the lungs,
which can allow the condition of the lungs to be assessed
more accurately than conventional methods such as spirometry,
which average the lung health across the whole lung into one
measure.
To
perform
dynamic
three-dimensional
(i.e.,
four-
dimensional, with time being the fourth dimension) dark-field
imaging, it is helpful to have a technique that can extract the
dark-field signal from a single sample exposure, to minimize
the data acquisition time. One potential candidate for this is
the single-grid imaging technique [16], [53], which is similar
to grating interferometry but uses only one grid, the image
of which is resolved at the detector, avoiding the need to
step the grid. Three complementary signals can be extracted
by comparing the sample-and-grid image to the grid-only
image. The single-grid imaging technique utilizes a relatively
simple setup (see Fig. 1) compared to other dark-field
imaging techniques, and it does not require any calibration
or alignment prior to the data acquisition process. The short
data acquisition time associated with this technique can also
reduce any potential motion-blur in the image and reduce the
radiation dose delivered to the sample, which is one of the
key considerations in clinical imaging. The sensitivity of the
imaging system to the dark-field signal can also be tuned by
simply changing the sample-to-detector propagation distance
and the pixel size, where a higher sensitivity can be achieved
with a smaller pixel size or a larger propagation distance.
Recently, How et al. developed an algorithm to extract and
quantify the dark-field signal from single-grid imaging [26]
and related the dark-field signal to the sample microstructure
size [27]. This was achieved by modelling the grid intensity
pattern, with and without the presence of the sample, as two
sinusoids and performing curve-fitting on the cross-correlation
results between the two sinusoids. The algorithm has also
been successfully applied to images taken using speckle-based
imaging, which is similar to single-grid imaging, where the
grid is simply replaced with a piece of sandpaper [6], [17],
with the results shown in Section 6.2 of How and Morgan [26].
Here we present the first dynamic in vivo dark-field lung CT
imaging of mice. This was achieved using single-grid imaging
and synchronizing the image acquisition with the breath cycle
of the mice. In total, 8 sets of 180◦sample-and-grid projection
images were obtained from a single scan, where each set
corresponds to a different equally spaced timepoint within the
breath cycle. The projection images were analyzed using the
algorithm developed in [26] to extract the attenuation, phase
shift, and dark-field signals. CT reconstructions were then per-
formed on the extracted images to obtain a three-dimensional
lung volume of respective signals at each timepoint. Here, a β-
ENaC-Tg mouse [54]–[60] with muco-obstructive disease and
emphysema, a mouse with induced lung cancer, and a wild-
type mouse were imaged. With the four-dimensional dark-field
data, we were able to measure and track how the strength of the
dark-field signal from different voxels across the lung changes
throughout a breath cycle across these three different mouse
models. By quantifying the dark-field signals and relating them
to the properties of the alveoli, this technique has the potential
to provide useful diagnostic information for lung diseases.
Fig. 1. The experimental single-grid imaging setup for in vivo 4D dark-field
lung imaging of mice, used here with a propagation distance of z=3.5 m. The
mouse was mechanically ventilated while being rotated 180◦to perform a
CT. The image acquisition procedure was synchronized with the ventilation
cycle.
II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
A. Imaging system
The experiment setup is shown in Fig. 1, and consists of a
typical single-grid imaging setup at a synchrotron. The exper-
iment was performed at the Australian Synchrotron Imaging
and Medical Beamline (IMBL), where the energy of x-rays
was set at 25 keV. An attenuating grid (a geological stainless
steel sieve with square holes of width 90 µm and wires 48 µm
thick, resulting in an effective period of 138 µm) was placed
50 cm upstream of the sample (i.e., as close as possible). A
pco.edge 5.5 sCMOS detector coupled to a 25 µm thick Gadox
phosphor was placed 3.5 m downstream from the sample,
providing an effective pixel size of 9.7 µm. This sample-
to-detector propagation distance was decided experimentally
by visually inspecting the sample-and-grid image and running
trial analysis to ensure that the grid intensity pattern had high
visibility and that the dark-field blurring of that pattern by
the lungs was detectable (see Section V-B for details). The
sample was placed on a CT stage and the attenuating grid
was placed on a separate stage, enabling both to be moved
in the horizontal and vertical directions remotely so that they
could be moved out of the field of view to take flat-field or
grid-only images.
B. Ethics Statement
All animal procedures were approved by the University
of Adelaide (M-2023-070), Walter and Eliza Hall Institute
(2023.006), and ANSTO (AS2023 04) animal ethics commit-
tees, and were conducted in accordance with the National
Health and Medical Research Council Australian Code of
Practice of the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Pur-
poses.
C. Mouse preparation
This proof-of-principle study focused on two lung disease
models, the β-ENaC-Tg mouse [54]–[60], which is a model of
muco-obstructive disease and emphysema, and the KRAS;p53
mutant (KP) [61] mouse model of lung cancer. The β-ENaC-
Tg mouse (5-6 months old, at which time the emphysema
phenotype is dominant) was supplied from the breeding colony
at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute
Preclinical, Imaging and Research Laboratories (SAHMRI
PIRL) facility in Adelaide, Australia. The lung cancer mouse
was supplied by the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Mel-
bourne, Australia, and was prepared by intravenously injecting
2.5x105 KrasG12D;p53∆/∆lung cancer cells (a kind gift from
Dr K. Sutherland) into C57B1/6 mice 4-6 weeks prior to the
experiment, as previously described [61]. The control mouse
was the normal littermate from the β-ENaC-Tg colony.
Mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injec-
tion of a mixture of 75 mg/kg of ketamine (Ceva, Australia)
and 1 mg/kg medetomidine (Ilium, Australia). Once anaes-
thetized, the mice were prepared by performing a tracheostomy
followed by cannulation with an endotracheal tube (ET; 20
Ga BD Insyte plastic cannula). The mice were then placed
in an animal holder in a supine (head-high) position with
both arms raised and attached to the holder to ensure a clear
field of view of the chest. The fur in the chest region of the
mice was not removed since the dark-field signal generated by
the fur was significantly weaker than the signal generated by
the lungs. A heat lamp was used throughout the imaging to
ensure constant body temperature. Mice were connected to an
Accuvent 200 small animal ventilator (4DMedical, Australia)
configured to a peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O,
positive end-expiratory pressure of 2 cmH2O, and ventilated at
120 breaths/min (170 ms inspiration and 330 ms expiration).
D. Time-resolved image acquisition
Image acquisition was performed in synchronization with
the ventilation cycle (see Fig. 2) to capture the dynamics of
the lung. This approach utilizes the repetitive motion of the
breathing of the mice and assumes that the lungs return to the
same position at the same timepoint in each breath cycle to
capture the next projection within the CT. A custom-designed
timing hub [62] used ventilator triggers to acquire images at 8
different evenly-spaced breath points, with the mouse rotated
continuously. Over each breath cycle, the mouse was rotated
by 0.1◦, resulting in a rotation of 0.0125◦between exposures.
By repeating this acquisition for 1800 breaths, 8 sets of 180◦of
projections were collected, with an increment of 0.1◦between
each projection image in a set, and where each of the 8 sets
corresponds to a different breath point. The acquisition time
for each projection was 62 ms, which consisted of 55 ms of
exposure time and 7 ms of image read-out time. The total time
required to perform one 4D CT scan was 15 minutes.
A CT was taken for each mouse with the grid present. For
each CT scan, the mouse was also moved out of the field
of view to collect the grid-only and flat-field images. Dark-
current images were taken at the end of each CT scan. Note
that the flat-field images were taken with a 40 ms exposure to
match the intensity levels seen in projections, and then scaled
accordingly.
After imaging, the mice were humanely killed by i.p.
overdose of lethabarb (150 mg/kg, Virbac, Australia). The
mice remained in the imaging position after being euthanized,
Fig. 2. A schematic diagram showing the synchronized image acquisition procedure. (a) Images were taken at 8 equally-spaced points (labelled with different
colors) in the breath cycle. The sample was continually rotated, allowing images to be captured across the breath cycle and across 180 degrees of projections. (b)
Each projection allowed an attenuation and dark-field image to be retrieved. (c) & (d) Selecting projections from the same breathpoint allows the reconstruction
of attenuation and dark-field CTs. Full details provided in Section II-D. Note that for illustration purposes, to demonstrate a rotation of the sample, the T0
image on the far right here is taken at the 100th breath, not the second breath. All the reconstructed attenuation and dark-field CT slices in this manuscript
are shown with the same greyscale. See Supplementary Video 1 for a 3D view of the images.
and the ventilator was set to maintain the lung at a constant
pressure of 10 cmH2O. The sample-to-detector propagation
distance was then reduced to 0.7 m and a second CT scan
without the grid was performed to obtain high-resolution
phase-retrieved CT slices for comparison to the lung tissue
histology and the dark-field CT. Note that the lack of lung
motion enabled a higher spatial resolution than possible in the
dynamic dark-field CT scan.
E. Histology
After x-ray imaging was completed, the lungs were
inflation-fixed in situ using a 10% formalin buffer at
18 cmH2O, removed and placed into formalin for at least 24
hours, and then transferred in 70% ethanol. Samples were
embedded in paraffin wax and 5 µm slices were mounted
onto slides. β-ENaC-Tg tissues were stained with Alcian
Blue/Periodic Acid Schiff for detection of mucus, and the lung
cancer mice with haematoxylin and eosin. Images were cap-
tured using an Olympus VS200 slide scanner, and visualized
using QuPath software.
III. ANALYSIS
A. Extracting the dark-field signal from projections
The projection images were first sorted into their corre-
sponding breath points and flat- and dark-current-corrected.
These images (shown in Fig. 2 (a)) were then analysed using
the single-grid dark-field retrieval algorithm as described in
[26], with a cross-correlation window size of 16 pixels to
match the grid period. To minimize the computing time, the
analysis was performed for every 10th pixel in the image. Al-
though the attenuation and dark-field images extracted (shown
in Fig. 2 (b)) in this way had a lower spatial resolution
compared to the raw images, the signals extracted across
the neighbouring pixels within the same period of the grid
(i.e., 16 pixels) were expected to be similar. The dark-field
images were then smoothed by a median square kernel of
size 5 pixels before the CT reconstruction to reduce the noise
level and minimize any artefacts originating from particularly
bright/dark pixels.
B. CT reconstruction
CT scans were reconstructed using the ASTRA Toolbox
[63], [64] implementation of filtered-back-projection with the
Ram-Lak filter. The dark-field signal retrieved using the al-
gorithm described in [26], V (referred to as DF in [26]),
is defined as the relative change in the visibility between
the sample-and-grid intensity image and grid-only intensity
image. This relative change in visibility, V, which is the most
common way to measure the dark-field signal in grating-
based techniques such as grating interferometry, follows an
exponential relationship with sample thickness, T (similar to
the Beer-Lambert Law) [20], [21],
V = exp(−µdT),
(1)
where µd represents the linear diffusion coefficient/dark-field
extinction coefficient. Given (1), we reconstructed the dark-
field CT of the lungs in the same way as we did for the
attenuation images, shown in Fig. 2 (c) & (d). After the CT
reconstruction, a three-dimensional median filter with a kernel
size of 3 pixels was applied to the three-dimensional dark-field
lung volume to minimize noise and any ring artefacts observed
in the CT slices.
C. Region of Interest (ROI) measurements
The spatial and temporal variations in the dark-field signal
could be extracted from the reconstructed three-dimensional
dark-field lung volume at 8 different breath points. For ex-
ample, the relative strength of the dark-field signal in the left
and right lung could be measured from a given CT slice. The
strength of the dark-field signal within certain voxels, or within
the left, the right, or even the whole lung, could also be tracked
throughout the breath cycle. Median values, rather than mean,
were measured from these regions of interest, given that part
of the lungs is made up of blood vessels or fully resolved
airways, which do not generate dark-field signals.
To extract time-resolved measurements at a given axial slice,
the motion of the lung had to be considered. That is, because
the lungs were primarily expanding in the vertical direction
towards the diaphragm during inhalation, a particular feature
within the lung tissue moves downwards through the axial CT
slices during the breath. This resulted in some lung tissues
moving in and out of the specific slice that we were interested
in during the breath cycle (see Supplementary Video 2).
Therefore, manual alignment of the lung tissue was performed
using features within the lungs such as the blood vessels or
major airways seen in the attenuation CT, in order to observe
the same lung tissue throughout the breath cycle. The same
alignment was then applied to the dark-field CT slices, and as
a result, a given measurement was performed over CT slices
with different slice numbers for each breath point, rather than
with a fixed slice number. For example, the 100th axial slice
at T0 matched better with the 103rd slice at T1, the 105th slice
at T2 and the 99th slice at the last breath point, T7.
Masks were manually drawn for the left and right lungs,
enabling measurements for either side or the whole lung. The
masks were traced on the attenuation CT slice at the last breath
point (i.e., the end of exhalation) when the lung volume was
the smallest. This ensured that the mask contained only lung
tissue at every breath point. For more local measurements,
ROIs of size 10 pixels × 10 pixels were chosen carefully to
Fig. 3. Representative example of the reconstructed (a) & (c) dark-field, µd,
and (b) & (d) attenuation, µ, CT slices in the coronal and axial planes of the
β-ENaC-Tg mouse at T0, together with (e) & (f) the magnified images of the
high-resolution phase-retrieved CT slices captured post-mortem. ROIs were
selected from two different lobes of the lungs that generated visibly different
dark-field signal strength, which is explained by the different lung structures
seen in (e) & (f). See Supplementary Video 3 for a time-resolved version of
this figure and see Supplementary Figure S2 for the histology slices.
only contain lung tissue through the breath, and neither blood
vessels nor fully-resolved airways.
IV. RESULTS
A. Spatial variations in dark-field
Fig. 3 (a) - (d) shows the reconstructed attenuation and dark-
field CT of the β-ENaC-Tg mouse, using signals retrieved
from the single-grid dark-field retrieval algorithm, sliced at the
coronal and axial planes. A clear difference in the strength of
the signal between lobes was observed in the dark-field im-
ages, which was not as visible in the attenuation images. This
is reflected in an increase of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)
between the two lobes from 2.4 in the retrieved attenuation
CT slice (Fig. 3 (d)) to 5.5 in the retrieved dark-field CT slice
(Fig. 3 (c)). This difference in the dark-field signal suggests
that the size of the alveoli in the lobes was different, where
smaller and more tightly-packed alveoli generate a stronger
dark-field tomographic signal than large and/or loosely-packed
alveoli. From the magnified image of the selected regions of
interest in post-mortem high-resolution CTs (Fig. 3 (e) & (f)),
it was observed that the alveoli in the right lobe of the lung
(labelled in orange) are indeed larger compared to the left lobe
(labelled in red), which is consistent with the dark-field signal.
B. Temporal variations in dark-field
Fig. 4 shows how the dark-field signal from the lungs of
a normal control mouse changes through a breath cycle. The
median dark-field signal measured from the left (blue), right
(orange) and whole (green, i.e., combining left and right) lungs
follow a similar trend with time. From the beginning of the
breath cycle, the strength of the dark-field signal decreased and
reached a minimum value at timepoint T2, which corresponds
to the period of inhalation (as shown in Fig. 2). During
exhalation, the strength of the dark-field signal gradually
returned to its initial level. The change in the dark-field signal
Fig. 4. The change in the dark-field signal from the lungs of a control mouse
throughout the breath cycle. The dark-field signal was measured from a slice
of thickness 97 µm taken from the middle part of the lungs. The measurement
for the whole lung (green) was taken from both the regions highlighted in blue
(left lung) and orange (right lung). At T2, when the lungs are most inflated,
the dark-field image has a more porous appearance, suggesting that airways
that were unresolved at T0 are now inflated and resolved (e.g., top right of
the axial slice).
suggests that the alveoli were expanding during the first part
of the breath cycle, and after reaching maximum expansion
(see the dark-field CT image at T2 in Fig. 4 and in Fig. 2),
the alveoli were relaxing/contracting for the remainder of the
breath cycle. It is worth noting that while the dark-field images
at different breath points were substantially different from each
other, the attenuation images were relatively similar to each
other. This suggests that the dark-field image can complement
the attenuation image, which only shows the fully resolved
features, by revealing information about unresolved sample
features like the alveoli.
C. Spatial and temporal variations in dark-field
With this 4D technique, we were able to extract time-
resolved measurements in highly-localised regions, as shown
in Fig. 5. The dark-field CT images show variations in dark-
field signal across the lungs, suggesting some variations in
the size or the number of alveoli. The dark-field signals
from different disease models also follow different trends. In
particular, the β-ENaC-Tg and cancer lungs (purple and blue)
generate weaker dark-field signals and smaller relative changes
in magnitude compared to the control lung (green).
The observed decrease in the strength of the dark-field
signal in the β-ENaC-Tg lung corresponds to the increase in
the alveoli size (as shown in Figure S2 of the Supplementary
Information). In the cancerous lung, the observed decrease in
dark-field signal may be attributed to tumour lesions obstruct-
ing airflow and hence affecting the aeration of the alveoli,

points across different models. Top: Attenuation and dark-field axial CT
slices retrieved at T0 from different parts of the lungs, as indicated by the
corresponding colored horizontal lines in the dark-field coronal slices. Bottom:

and dark-purple dotted line for red box) changes throughout the breath cycle.

and cancer-affected mice.
and/or a decrease in the fraction of the lung tissue made
up of alveoli (as shown in Figure S3 of the Supplementary
Information).
The variations in dark-field signal across the breath cycle
are also reduced for the disease models, suggesting reduced
elasticity of the alveoli and/or obstructed airflow. By focusing
on specific regions of interest, we can obtain localised lung
health measurements that are lost in an averaged measurement
across the whole lung or potentially even in projection. This
is shown by the stronger dark-field signal measured from the
yellow ROI in the left lobe of the β-ENaC-Tg lungs, which
suggests the presence of more densely-packed alveolar tissue,
particularly when compared to the red ROI in the right lobe.
These results show the potential of time-resolved dark-field
CT for providing more accurate diagnostic information for
lung diseases.
V. DISCUSSION
This manuscript has shown the first dynamic in vivo dark-
field CT lung imaging, achieved via the single-grid imaging
technique. This technique simplifies dynamic imaging since it
only requires a single sample exposure and a simple set-up,
as opposed to other dark-field imaging techniques [19], [65],
[66], which require multiple sample exposures and/or a more
complicated setup to extract the dark-field signal. Using single-
grid imaging, we were able to measure the three-dimensional
dark-field signal and thus the scattering strength of the lung
tissues throughout a breath cycle via the linear diffusion
coefficient, µd, which could potentially be used as a parameter
to assess how healthy the lungs are, either globally or locally.
In this section, we will discuss the feasibility of extracting
quantitative measurements of alveolar dimension using this
technique, optimal setup parameters, challenges in moving
towards clinical application, and some future directions.
A. Quantitative dark-field signal
Since the strength of the dark-field signal originates from the
alveoli of the lung, which are not fully resolved by the imaging
system, this dark-field signal can provide complementary
information about lung health. In the approach shown here,
we see this complementarity and we can track the changes in
the strength of the dark-field signal across each part of the
lung over time.
Future research could take the dark-field signals extracted
from the lungs and quantify the average size of the alveoli,
using calibration data obtained from PMMA microspheres of
the same size as typical alveoli of mice, following the approach
in [27]. In addition, the change in the surface-area-to-volume
ratio of the alveoli could also be determined from the change in
the retrieved µd value, given the direct proportionality between
these quantities [67]. For example, if the µd value increases by
20%, then the surface-area-to-volume ratio of the alveoli has
also increased by 20% and vice versa. By tracking the change
in the surface-area-to-volume ratio through the breath cycle,
we could determine the expansion rate of the alveoli, which
could provide a better assessment of lung function. Further
analysis, including detailed comparisons with histology (see
Supplementary Figures S1 - S3), could also be performed
to better understand and verify how the dark-field signal is
related to the size of the alveoli and hence lung health in
various disease models. We hope that this quantitative time-
resolved dark-field imaging technique can be developed into
a new functional imaging modality and provide quantitative
measurements for other lung diseases that also result in a
change in the size and structure of the alveoli, such as fibrosis
[44] and COPD [47], which could be beneficial for biomedical
research and eventually for clinical studies.
B. Optimal setup parameters to perform single-exposure dark-
field imaging
The key experimental parameters in this single-exposure x-
ray dark-field imaging technique are the sample-to-detector
propagation distance, the pixel size, and the period of the grid
intensity pattern. Note that in this technique, the direct shadow
of the grid on the detector is resolved, not the pattern that
arises from the Talbot effect, and hence the expression for
the Talbot distance [1] is not applicable here. For the case of
multiple refraction through the microstructures, if either a) the
scattering cone angle θ, or b) the sample microstructure size
and material are known and the calibration curve (as shown
in Fig. 7 of [27]) is available, then the optimal propagation
distance can be calculated using [27]
zopt = p
πθ =
p
πK
√
T
.
(2)
Here, p represents the period of the grid intensity pattern, T
represents the sample thickness which can be retrieved from
the reconstructed attenuation CT slices, and the parameter K
can be obtained from the calibration curve available for known
microstructure size. However, while this could be determined
for a class of samples (e.g., mouse lungs or rat lungs), an
appropriate sample-to-detector propagation distance can also
be determined experimentally. As a rule of thumb, the pixel
size needs to be sufficiently small such that one period of
the grid intensity pattern can be sampled by around 14 pixels
(or at least 7 pixels), with some dependence on the point
spread function of the camera. The blurring width from the
sample microstructures needs to be a sufficiently large fraction
of the point spread function that the blurring is visible. This
can be achieved by changing the propagation distance to tune
the sensitivity of the imaging system to the dark-field signal.
The larger the propagation distance, the greater the blurring
width and, thus, the stronger the dark-field signal. However,
the propagation distance should not be too large to the extent
that the grid intensity pattern is blurred-out altogether, which
results in saturation of the dark-field signal. It is also worth
noting that when moving to imaging larger animals, a longer
propagation distance may be required if a larger pixel size
is used, since a larger pixel is less sensitive to the dark-field
blurring.
C. Challenges and future directions
Although the single-grid dark-field imaging technique only
requires a single sample exposure, which is beneficial for
dynamic imaging, the main challenge is that it is best-suited
to mm-to-cm-sized samples since a relatively small pixel size
is required to resolve blurring directly, as discussed in the
previous section. Although this could be overcome by using a
detector with both a large area and a small pixel size, such an
approach may not be feasible due to the availability of such
detectors. In addition, a relatively high radiation dose may be
required to achieve sufficient counts in many small pixels.
It is also worth noting that our algorithm is able to extract
the differential phase signal in addition to the attenuation
and dark-field signal. However, the differential phase signal
extracted from the mouse was relatively weak compared to
the other two signals, resulting in a noisy image. Since it is
outside the scope of this paper, the differential phase images
are not included.
One possible direction for future investigation includes
performing this technique using laboratory x-ray sources.
Since the single-grid imaging technique only requires a certain
degree of spatial coherence [68], it could also be performed
using a polychromatic x-ray source with a sufficiently small
source size [16], [68] in a laboratory-based setup. Although
this technique does not require a temporally coherent source,
note that a polychromatic source can result in the inaccurate
measurement of quantitative dark-field signal, due to beam
hardening [69]–[71] and visibility hardening [72] effects,
which would result in an additional reduction to the visibility
of the grid intensity pattern.
To automate the process of tracking a particular volume
of lung tissue through the breath, this technique could be
combined with x-ray velocimetry (XV) analysis [73], which
measures how much the lung tissues expand between each
breath point [60], [74]–[76]. XV imaging could be performed
on the phase-enhanced attenuation images, and hence automate
the processing pipeline.
In addition to in vivo lung imaging, the 4D dark-field imag-
ing technique described here could be useful for the imaging
of other dynamic processes, such as the production of metal
foams [77] or chemical reactions that involve the formation or
decomposition of substances in an aqueous solution, which act
as unresolved microstructures and provide a dark-field signal
[78], [79]. For these applications, the data acquisition protocol
could be modified to perform multiple rotations (instead of
just one rotation) to capture the non-periodic sample changes
instead of the repeated sample changes seen in this study.
The experimental approach taken here can also be used
to extract a directional dark-field signal [80], [81], which
arises from microstructures that are elongated and aligned in
a particular direction, in a dynamic process. By modelling the
blurring function as a two-dimensional anisotropic Gaussian
distribution [81], Croughan et al. [18] successfully applied
the single-grid technique to extract the directional dark-field
signal, including both the angle at which the microstructures
are oriented and the eccentricity of the blurring from the
microstructures, from bundles of carbon fibres oriented in dif-
ferent directions with water slowly travelling from the bottom
of the fibres to the top via capillary action (see Visualisation 1
from [18]). This directional dark-field imaging technique can
also be useful in imaging nanoparticle strings to monitor the
delivery of drugs down the airways [82].
Another challenge that we encountered in this experiment
was the source-size blurring seen at larger sample-to-detector
propagation distances. We observed that at a 3.5 m propagation
distance, the grid intensity pattern in the horizontal direction
was blurred significantly, with a resulting visibility of 0.08
(cf. 0.2 visibility in the vertical direction). This is due to
the source being extended in the horizontal direction at the
IMBL, resulting in a stronger source-size blurring, and thus
it was more challenging to extract the dark-field signal in the
horizontal direction. This could be overcome by performing a
correction on the raw sample-and-grid images for these non-
dark-field blurring effects prior to analysis, as demonstrated
by Croughan et al. [83]. This source-size blurring effect was
not an issue in this application, since the dark-field signal from
the alveoli was measured under the assumption of rotationally-
symmetric x-ray scattering. However, this could be an issue for
samples made up of microstructures that scatter anisotropically
[80]. The inevitable motion-blurring effect from the heart
was another issue we encountered in this experiment, but the
effect was minimal since only a very small part of the lungs
(i.e., the region surrounding the heart) is affected by this. With
a high-brightness source, image capture could potentially also
be synchronized to the heartbeat, as previously shown with
propagation-based phase contrast imaging [84].
VI. CONCLUSION
We have presented the first in vivo 4D dark-field lung
imaging of mice. This was achieved by synchronizing data
acquisition with the breath cycle, and was possible because
of the short acquisition times that can be used in single-grid
dark-field imaging. This 4D imaging technique provides three-
dimensional dark-field images with minimal motion blurring
from the moving lungs throughout a breath cycle, a challenge
with other dark-field imaging techniques that require multiple
exposures to extract the dark-field signal.
We have shown that the dark-field CT images provide
information complementary to the attenuation CT images, for
example, how the alveoli change in size throughout the breath
cycle and how the size of the alveoli vary from one part of
a lung to another, in the case of both healthy and diseased
lungs. It was observed that the strength of the dark-field
signal decreases during inhalation, suggesting that the alveoli
are expanding, thus increasing in size; during exhalation, the
strength of the dark-field signal increases, suggesting that the
alveoli are contracting/relaxing, thus decreasing in size. The
reconstructed dark-field signal, or more specifically, the linear
diffusion coefficient value, µd, also indicates the surface-area-
to-volume ratio of the alveoli within each voxel [67]. We were
also able to measure the dark-field signal from specific ROIs,
which provides regional information for the lungs.
One future direction includes quantitatively relating the
time-resolved dark-field signal to the physical properties of the
alveoli, such as the size or the rate of expansion. This could
allow us to measure the expansion rate of the alveoli and thus
regionally assess how healthy the lungs are. Furthermore, a
future study could look at the variability in these measures
across larger cohorts of animals. Although this technique is
currently limited to the imaging of small-sized samples, we
hope that this technique can equip biomedical research studies
immediately and, long-term, potentially be developed into a
low-dose, non-invasive and accurate functional lung imaging
technique in the future.
