When analyzing the individual positional dynamics of an ensemble of moving objects, the ex-
tracted parameters that characterize the motion of individual objects, such as the mean-squared
instantaneous velocity or the diffusivity, exhibit a spread that is due to the convolution of three
different effects: i) Motion stochasticity, caused by the fluctuating environment and enhanced by
limited observation time, ii) measurement errors that depend on details of the detection technique,
and iii) the intrinsic parameter variance that characterizes differences between individual objects, the
quantity of ultimate interest. We develop the theoretical framework to separate these effects using
the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which constitutes the most general description of active
and passive dynamics, as it derives from the general underlying many-body Hamiltonian for the
studied system without approximations. We apply our methodology to determine intrinsic cell-to-
cell differences of living human breast-cancer cells, algae cells and, as a benchmark, size differences of
passively moving polystyrene beads in water. We find algae and human breast-cancer cells to exhibit
significant individual differences, reflected by the spreading of the intrinsic mean-squared instanta-
neous velocity over two orders of magnitude, which is remarkable in light of the genetic homogeneity
of the investigated breast-cancer cells and highlights their phenotypical diversity. Quantification of
the intrinsic variance of single-cell properties is relevant for infection biology, ecology and medicine
and opens up new possibilities to estimate population heterogeneity on the single-organism level in
a non-destructive manner. Our framework is not limited to motility properties but can be readily
applied to general experimental time-series data.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Cells of a population typically exhibit largely differ-
ent genotypes and phenotypes, which creates optimized
fitness in reaction to external stimuli. Oftentimes, it is
important to know how heterogeneous cells or organisms
are, e.g.
in order to estimate survival probabilities in
reaction to environmental changes [1–3] or in order to
determine the likelihood of an infection by pathogens
[4, 5]. The heterogeneity of a population of organisms
is typically quantified by hand-picked parameters, for in-
stance the cell size [6], specific binding coefficients [7, 8],
positional speed of the organism [9–11] etc. One exper-
imentally relatively easily obtainable observable is the
position of an organism measured over time, i.e.
its
positional trajectory, which requires minimal perturba-
tion of the organism during the measurement and can be
used to distinguish different organisms from each other
[12]. To quantify and compare trajectories one usually
assumes a model. The most general equation of motion
for a general observable that can be derived exactly from
the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics is the generalized
Langevin equation (GLE), which was successfully used
to model binary reaction dynamics in water [13], water
vibrational IR line shapes [14], butane dihedral dynam-
ics [15], single cell motion [12, 16] and protein folding
[17, 18]. The GLE includes non-Markovian effects, i.e.,
the memory of the trajectory of its past, and is valid
even for non-equilibrium processes, such as cell motion
[12, 19].
Important limiting cases of the GLE are the
persistent random walk (PRW) and Brownian diffusion
models as well as active walk models such as the active
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model [20, 21], which are explained
in more detail further below. The motion of any organ-
ism and of any microscopic object, be it active or passive,
contains intrinsic stochasticity due to the fluctuating en-
vironment [22], which is fully captured by the description
with the GLE.
Every trajectory that is observed over a finite time
span inevitably leads to some uncertainty in the ex-
tracted parameters. Therefore, every experimental de-
termination of model parameters contains a spread that
originates from the stochasticity of the motion, entan-
gled with experimental measurement errors and with the
actual spread due to differences between the individual
moving objects. There are many methods available to
estimate parameters of stochastic processes [16, 23] and
to estimate the inevitable variance of such parameters
[24, 25]. One standard way to asses parameter uncertain-
ties for stochastic processes is to simulate the stochastic
model and to compare with experimental data [24, 26].
However, the field of motility analysis yet lacks methods
to disentangle the spread of intrinsic properties between
individual objects from the noise of the environment and
other experimental uncertainties.
In this paper we introduce an approach to tackle this
problem: By simulating the stochastic process of motion
arXiv:2410.14561v1  [physics.bio-ph]  18 Oct 2024
2
for the experimental finite observation time with the uni-
versally applicable GLE model of motion and using a sta-
tistical variance analysis, we estimate the intrinsic spread
of the parameters characterizing the individual moving
objects. We show that the active and passive movements
of individual objects of three very different types, chosen
to cover a wide range of different patterns of motion, are
all perfectly described by the GLE. Specifically, we con-
sider the passive diffusion of polystyrene beads in water,
the active motion of human breast-cancer cells on a sub-
strate and the flagella-propelled motion of algae cells in
two-dimensional confinement. The polystyrene-bead sys-
tem constitutes a benchmark with known bead-to-bead
differences, for which we confirm that our model esti-
mates the correct intrinsic parameter variance. The al-
gae and the human breast-cancer cell data reveal a sim-
ilar large variance over two orders of magnitude in the
intrinsic motion parameters, which is noteworthy as the
cancer cells derive from a single cell line and thus share
very similar genetic code, while the algae cells stem from
multiple colonies and presumably are genetically rather
heterogeneous. This showcases a significant phenotypic
cell variance, manifested in the differences of the motion
of individual cells, that is largely independent of the ge-
netic diversity.
Our framework is generally applicable
to ensembles of time-series data and allows to separate
stochastic environmental influences from intrinsic varia-
tions between individual ensemble members.

RESULTS
A.
Trajectory model
We analyze trajectories of three different moving ob-
jects, firstly the purely passive motion of polystyrene
beads in water with a known size distribution, secondly
the motion of human breast-cancer cells of line MDA-
MB-231 on a one-dimensional micro lane [16, 27, 28] and
finally the motion of micro algae cells Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii confined between two glass plates [12, 29],
which resembles their natural environment in soil. Ex-
emplary microscopy images of the three different mov-
ing objects considered in the experiments are shown in
Figs. 1a-c. We choose these three systems as they cover
important limiting scenarios, namely, passive Brownian
diffusion (polystyrene beads), active persistent random
motion (cancer cells) and strongly non-Markovian active
motion (algae cells). Thus, our data sets include Marko-
vian motion and non-Markovian motion in equilibrium
as well as out of equilibrium. The experiments yield two-
dimensional trajectories x(t), y(t) for the center position
of the polystyrene beads and the algae cells, examples
of which are shown in Figs. 1d,f, respectively, and one-
dimensional trajectories x(t) for the breast-cancer cells,
an example of which is shown in Fig. 1e. We describe all
trajectories by the GLE
¨x(t) = −
Z t
t0
Γv(t −t′) ˙x(t′)dt′ + FR(t)
(1)
with an identical equation for y(t) in the case of two-
dimensional motion. The range of different types of mo-
tion in the experiments illustrates the universal applica-
bility of the GLE. For Gaussian motion processes, which
perfectly describe the experiments as explained further
below, the equation of motion is linear and there is no
coupling between the motion in x and y direction, there-
fore, we average all two-dimensional trajectory data over
the two directions. In the GLE eq. (1), ¨x(t) = ˙v(t) de-
notes the acceleration of the position, Γv(t) is a memory
kernel that describes how the acceleration at time t de-
pends on the velocity ˙x(t′) = v(t′) at previous times and
therefore accounts for non-Markovian friction effects, and
FR(t) is a random force that describes interactions with
the surrounding and the interior of the moving object.
We show further below that all different types of active
and passive motion we consider are perfectly described
by the GLE eq.
(1).
Since the experimental systems
are isotropic and homogeneous in the observed space, no
deterministic force term appears in the GLE. In fact,
the GLE in eq. (1) is the most general equation of mo-
tion for Gaussian unconfined motion processes and can
be derived by projection from the underlying many-body
Hamiltonian, even in the presence of non-equilibrium ef-
fects, which obviously are present for living organisms
[19, 30–32]. An important special case of the GLE eq.
(1) is the Markovian limit with Γ(t) = 2δ(t)/τm, which
leads to the well known Langevin equation and describes
persistent motion. In the so-called overdamped limit, in
which case the persistence time τm goes to zero, one re-
covers the even simpler Brownian diffusion model.
If the motion can be described as a Gaussian process,
which for polystyrene beads, cancer cells and for algae
cells is suggested by the fact that the single-individual
velocity distributions are Gaussian, as shown in Figs.
2b,e,h, the random force is Gaussian as well [19] with
correlations given by
⟨FR(t)FR(0)⟩= ΓR(t) ,
(2)
where ΓR(t) denotes the symmetric random-force kernel.
Averaging cell velocities over the cell population can re-
sult in non-Gaussian velocity distributions, even though
distributions are Gaussian on the individual trajectory
level [12, 16], as we show in the SI. Therefore we check
the Gaussianity on the single-trajectory level in Fig. 2.
The GLE eq.
(1) does not contain time-dependent
parameters and, therefore, describes a stationary process.
Indeed, for the polystyrene beads, the cancer cells as well
as for the algae cells the velocity distributions do not
change in time as shown in Figs. 2c,f,i, which suggests
that the GLE can be used to model the objects’ motion.
For an equilibrium system, such as the passively mov-
ing polystyrene beads in water, the fluctuation dissipa-
tion theorem (FDT) predicts ΓR(t) = BΓv(|t|) with the

mean-squared velocity B ≡⟨v2⟩given by B = kBT/m
according to the equipartition theorem, where m is the
mass of the moving object and kBT denotes the thermal
energy [30, 31]. For living cells, both FDT and equiparti-
tion theorem do not hold in general and thus there is no
a priori reason why BΓv(|t|) and ΓR(t) should be equal
[33, 34]. Nevertheless, for non-equilibrium scenarios with
Gaussian statistics one can construct a surrogate model
with an effective kernel Γ(|t|) = ΓR(t)/B = Γv(|t|) that
exactly reproduces the dynamics described by the non-
equilibrium GLE with ΓR(t) ̸= BΓv(|t|) [12, 19]. Thus,
for each combination of ΓR(t) and Γv(t), a unique Γ(t) ex-
ists, which can be extracted from trajectories via the ve-
locity autocorrelation function (VACF) [12, 16] (as shown
in the SI). Since the VACF completely determines the dy-
namics of a Gaussian system [12, 35], this implies that
the extracted effective kernel Γ(t) not only describes the
VACF exactly but also completely characterizes the mo-
tion [35]. Recent work, where the non-equilibrium GLE
is derived from a suitably chosen time-dependent Hamil-
tonian, shows that for Gaussian non-equilibrium observ-
ables the condition ΓR(t) = BΓv(|t|) is actually satisfied
[19], in line with our method that is based on extracting
an effective kernel Γ(t) for active cell motion. Since we
show that the GLE is appropriate to model our exper-
imental trajectory data, we can use it to produce syn-
thetic trajectories with the same length as experimental
trajectories shown in Figs. 2a,c,g and compare them to
the experiments, which is key to determining the vari-
ance of parameters characterizing the individual objects’
differences.
B.
Trajectory analysis
A suitable characterization of stochastic trajectories
employs the VACF or the MSD, defined by
Cvv(t) = ⟨v(0)v(t)⟩,
(3)
CMSD(t) = ⟨(x(0) −x(t))2⟩,
(4)
respectively. Even though the VACF is just the curva-
ture of the MSD, Cvv(t) = 1
2
d2
dt2 CMSD(t), these correla-
tion functions accentuate different aspects of trajectories.
For the passively moving polystyrene beads, the MSD in
Fig. 3a demonstrates the purely diffusive nature of the
motion, where the average over all beads (black symbols)
agrees well with the Brownian prediction CMSD(t) = 2Dt
for a sphere of radius r = 0.5 µm shown as a dashed
green line. For this prediction we use the Einstein re-
lation between the friction of a moving object with its
environment γ at temperature T and the diffusivity D,
where the friction of a sphere with radius r depends on

Velocities follow from trajectories using finite differences
(see Methods eq. (11)), which depend on the recording
time step ∆and localization noise. The VACF for the
polystyrene beads in Fig. 3b exhibits a single peak at
time zero, which reflects that consecutive displacements
are completely uncorrelated and shows that the persis-
tence time τm is much smaller than ∆. This implies that
the friction kernel Γ(t) is a delta function, which per-
fectly matches the extracted kernel shown in Fig.
3c.
We explain the extraction scheme of the friction kernel
in detail in the SI. For the actively moving cancer cells,
the average MSD over all cells exhibits superdiffusive be-
havior ∝t1.6 with a slightly decreasing slope for longer
times shown in Fig. 3d, where the long time diffusive
regime is not well resolved due to larger noise (caused
by less averaging) for long times. The VACFs of the ac-
tively moving cancer cells are decaying on the scale of
a few minutes, as shown in Fig.
3e.
Similarly to the
polystyrene beads, the friction kernels shown in Fig. 3f
exhibit a delta peak at time zero, followed by a dip at
the first time step t = ∆= 20 s and is then zero. This
dip, which is also present for the algae cell kernels at the
first time step t = ∆= 0.002 s in Fig. 3i, originates from
localization noise (see SI for more information), as this
noise reduces the correlation of consecutive velocities and
influences the extracted kernel [12]. For algae cells the
MSD exhibits a long ballistic regime up to a few seconds
followed by the long time diffusive regime, as shown in
Fig. 3g, whereas the VACF in Fig. 3h shows strong os-
cillations that correspond to the flagella beat cycle with
5
a frequency of ∼50 Hz.
The extracted friction kernel
shown in Fig. 3i shows oscillations as well, but the os-
cillations exhibit a slightly different frequency because of
the complex dependence of the VACF frequency on the
kernel amplitude and frequency [12].
The extracted friction kernels imply different modes of
motion. For the algae cells in Fig. 3i, the kernel exhibits a
delta peak at time zero followed by a decaying oscillation,
which was previously modeled by [12]
Γ(t) = 2aδ(t) + be−t/τ

cos(Ωt) + 1
τΩsin(Ωt)

.
(6)
The extracted kernels of the cancer cells in Fig.
3f
suggest a simple persistent random walk [36] (note that
an earlier study modeled a different cancer cell line by
a slightly more complex model including an exponential
decay in the friction kernel Γ(t) [16]).
The persistent
random walk is described by the GLE eq. (1) with
Γ(t) = 2δ(t)/τm ,
(7)
where the transition from the ballistic to the long time
diffusive regime, i.e.
the persistence time τm, occurs
for cancer cells within the experimentally observed time
scales; the mean value τm ≈2 min is in the order of min-
utes and thus much larger than the time step of ∆= 20 s.
Therefore, the observed superdiffusive scaling behavior of
the ensemble-averaged MSD in Fig. 3d is explained by
the transition from ballistic ∝t2 to the long time diffu-
sive regime ∝t, which is confirmed by fits of the model to
single-cell data explained below. In contrast to the can-
cer cells, the persistence time of the polystyrene beads
estimated by τm = m/γ ≈0.1 µs is much smaller than
the experimental time resolution ∆= 0.02 s, so that only
the long-time diffusive behavior is observed. Hence, we
model the polystyrene beads by pure diffusion, in which
case the GLE eq. (1) simplifies to
˙x(t) =
√
Dξ(t) ,
(8)
where ξ(t) is uncorrelated white noise with ⟨ξ(t)⟩= 0
and ⟨ξ(0)ξ(t)⟩= 2δ(t).
In Fig. 4 we show fits of the analytical models to the
MSD, VACF and friction kernel data using for a sin-
gle polystyrene bead, eq. (8), for a single breast-cancer
cell eqs.
(1) and (7), and for a single algae cell, eqs.
(1) and (6), all randomly selected from the ensemble of
moving objects. The GLE describes the data perfectly,
which confirms the applicability of the GLE to describe
the active or passive motion of single moving objects.
Moreover, the model that includes localization noise (de-
scribed in the Methods) correctly captures the decorre-
lation of consecutive velocities seen in the VACF in Figs.
4e,h and the dip in the kernel at the first time step seen
in Figs. 4f,i. In the case of pure diffusion, consecutive
displacements are uncorrelated, thus, the effect of the lo-
calization noise is not visible as strongly in the VACF
and the friction kernel of the diffusing polystyrene beads
in Figs. 4b,c.
C.
Reproducing experimental parameter
distributions by simulation
Even though all polystyrene beads are nearly iden-
tical, with the standard deviation of the radius being
∆r ∼25 nm according to the manufacturer and as con-
firmed by our measurement of the bead radii by atomic
force microscopy (explained in the SI), the extracted
MSDs, VACFs and friction kernels of single beads scat-
ter significantly around the mean, as seen in Figs. 3a-c.
Hence, the fitted single-bead parameters show a large
spread, seen in Fig. 5a, which does not reflect the true
parameter spread that the beads actually exhibit, as we
demonstrate further below.
For living organisms it is often not known how similar
individuals of one population are to each other. Natu-
rally, the question arises: How much of the spread of the
parameters extracted from experimental data originates
from differences among individuals and how much comes
from the motion stochasticity and experimental errors?
We imagine the scenario that all individuals are com-
pletely identical and are represented by the median of
the extracted parameter distribution. Here, we use the
median instead of the mean, because a least-squares fit
of a noisy exponential function leads to a log-normal dis-
tribution of the fitting parameters with the median being
the best representation of the true parameter value, as
explained in the SI. We simulate the same number of ex-
perimentally recorded trajectories N, with the same tra-
jectory length distribution as in the experiment shown in
Figs. 2a,d,g using the median parameters estimated from
the experimental trajectories using the GLE model at a
temporal resolution h which is 20 to 200 times smaller
than the experimental discretization ∆.
We then use
every (∆/h)-th point of the simulation to obtain a tra-
jectory with time step ∆and add the localization noise
to the trajectories, which is estimated directly by our fit
described in the Methods.
From such a simulation of
N trajectories with identical parameters, we extract the
VACF and perform the same fit that we used to extract
the parameters from the experiment.
If the spread of
the distribution extracted from the N simulations with
identical GLE parameters is comparable to the spread of
the distribution extracted from the experiment, then it
is likely that all moving objects are actually completely
identical in their motion parameters.
In fact, the experimentally determined spread of the
single breast-cancer cell parameters shown in Fig.
5e
and of the single algae cell parameters shown in Fig. 5i
are much larger than the spread of the respective pa-
rameters extracted from simulations with identical input
parameters, shown in Figs. 5f,j by the red triangles. This
suggests that the ensemble of cancer cells as well as the
ensemble of algae cells are not characterized by identi-
cal parameters of motion. In contrast, in Fig. 5b the
spread of the bead parameter distribution extracted from
the simulations with identical input parameters is almost
as large as the spread of the parameter distribution ex-

line in (a) is the theoretical prediction for the diffusion of a sphere with radius r = 0.5 µm in water predicted by the Einstein
relation eq. (5). The black dashed lines in the MSD plots indicate the scaling behavior. The dotted line in (g) shows the long
time diffusive regime from a recording with lower spatial resolution and longer observation times.
tracted from the experiment, indicating that most of the
observed spread originates from the finite length and the
experimental noise, in line with the small variance of the
bead radii determined by our AFM measurement.
The simulation results in Figs. 5f,j suggest that the in-
dividual cancer and algae cells are characterized by non-
identical GLE parameters within the respective popula-
tions. To determine the actual parameter distribution of
individual cells, we test whether simulations using input
parameters from a Gaussian distribution with a certain
covariance Covinp result in an extracted parameter dis-
tribution that agrees in the covariance Covsim with the
covariance of the parameter distribution extracted from
the experiment Covexp. For this we use a so-called per-
mutation test that compares the covariances Covsim and
Covexp, which is explained in the Methods.
We denote the summed ratio of the d-dimensional in-
put parameter covariance for the simulation, Covinp, and
the covariance of the distribution extracted from the ex-
periment, Covexp, as

as
Covij = ⟨(zi −⟨zi⟩)(zj −⟨zj⟩)⟩with zi being the compo-
nents of the vector ⃗z and ⟨zi⟩the d components of the
mean vector, d denotes the number of parameters. We
consider input covariances in the range from S = 0, which
corresponds to all moving objects described by identical
input parameters of motion, to S = 1, where we use the
parameter distribution extracted from the experiment as
the simulation input parameters. For intermediate val-
ues 0 < S < 1, simulation input distributions are drawn
from Gaussian distributions with covariances that are
uniformly rescaled by S.

FIG. 4. Experimental results for the MSD, CMSD(t), VACF, Cvv(t), and friction kernel Γ(t), of a single bead (a)-(c), a single
cancer cell (d)-(f) and a single algae cell (g)-(i) (blue symbols). The red lines denote predictions of the model defined in eq.
(8) fitted to the bead MSD, of the model defined in eqs. (1) and (7) fitted to the cancer cell VACF and of the model defined
in eqs. (1) and (6) fitted to the algae cell VACF. The individual bead, cancer cell and algae were picked at random; we show
the individuals with the best fits to the models and the distribution of R2, which measures the goodness of the fit, in the SI.
The main result of our method is the value S∗, for
which the covariance of the distribution extracted from
the experiment Covexp agrees with the covariance of the
distributions extracted from simulations Covsim with the
given input covariance Covinp∗. Hence, we call S∗the
estimated covariance ratio and the corresponding input
covariance Covinp∗the intrinsic parameter covariance of
individual objects.
Examples of distributions that are
extracted from simulations with the green input distri-
butions Covinp∗in 5c,g,k are shown in Figs. 5d,h,l (red
triangles), which agree with the respective experimental
distribution (blue symbols) according to our statistical
test described in the Methods. The statistical test that
we use compares the covariance of the experimentally de-
termined parameter covariance Covexp to the covariance
of a parameter distribution extracted from a simulation
Covsim and yields a measure of how likely the two distri-
butions originate from the same input covariance, which
we call p2. If several values of S are accepted by our sta-
tistical test, meaning they lead to agreeing covariances
Covsim and Covexp according to the test, we choose the
midpoint of the accepted range as S∗and use the upper
and lower acceptance bounds to estimate the error of S∗,
as demonstrated in Fig. 6.
As an example, the diffusion of polystyrene beads in
water is described by the two-dimensional parameter vec-
tor comprising the diffusivity D and the localization noise
width σloc, ⃗z = (D, σloc), the latter defines the uncer-
tainty of the position data (see Methods).

FIG. 5. Distributions of GLE model parameters extracted from the experiments are shown as blue symbols, for polystyrene
beads we show the localization noise width σloc and diffusivity D in (a)-(d), for cancer cells the mean squared velocity B and
the persistence time τm in (e)-(h) and for the algae cells the mean squared velocity B and the kernel oscillation amplitude b
(see eq. (6)) in (i)-(l). The green symbols in (b), (f), (j) represent the respective median of the distribution of blue symbols
and the red filled triangles represent the parameters extracted from a simulation where all objects have the median parameter
set and using the experimental time step and length distribution, shown in Figs. 2a,d,g. Empty triangles in (c), (g) denote
Gaussian distributions of simulation parameters with S = 0.56 and S = 0.83, respectively, which correspond to our estimate for
the actual parameter spread S∗shown in Fig. 6a. In (k) simulation parameters (green triangles) correspond to the parameters
extracted from the experiment, which means that S = 1. Simulations using the empty green triangle parameters in (c), (g),
(k) and the respective model suggested by the data eqs. (6), (7), (8) and the experimental trajectory lengths lead to the filled
red triangles in (d), (h), (l), which by definition of S∗have the same covariance as the blue symbols.
Covsim is the same as the parameter covariance extracted
from the experiment Covexp according to our statisti-
cal test, we do the same for S = 0.2. Then we repeat
the test increasing S in steps of 0.1 up to finally using
S = 1. In the regime of accepted S values we use smaller
steps to determine S∗. For accepted values in the range
S = 0.05 −0.15, we would obtain the estimated covari-
ance ratio as S∗= 0.1 ± 0.05. The evaluation of S∗is
graphically depicted in Figs. 6b-d.
For the polystyrene beads we find S∗= 0.56 ± 0.21
as shown in Fig. 6a, which translates into an estimate
for the standard deviation of the bead radius ∆r =
86 ± 63 nm via the Einstein law eq. (5) and using the
viscosity of water at room temperature η ≈1 mPs. The
bead radius standard deviation of ∆r ∼25 nm listed
by the manufacturer and confirmed by our atomic force
microscopy (AFM) measurements is close to the lower
bound of our result. Nevertheless, it should be noted that
other experimental factors such as the bead-surface prop-
erties contribute to additional individual-to-individual
variance in diffusivity, thereby increasing the variance
of the hydrodynamic radius ∆r, which explain our rel-
atively large estimate of ∆r.
For the cancer cells the estimated covariance ratio is
9
given by S∗= 0.83 ± 0.17 shown in Fig. 6a, which in-
dicates a spread over nearly two orders of magnitude in
the mean squared cell speed B and in the persistence
time τm, seen in Fig. 5g, even though all cells are from
the same cell line and supposedly share the same genetic
code. This demonstrates the large phenotype variance
among cancer cells of the same cell line. The distribu-
tion extracted from the algae trajectories represents the
true cell-to-cell variance accurately, as seen by comparing
Figs. 5k,l, and as reflected by S∗= 0.98 ± 0.02 shown in
Fig. 6a.
Additionally
to
decomposing
the
spread
on
the
individual-to-individual level, our approach allows us to
estimate how long experimental recordings have to be, in
order to obtain a certain level of S∗. The variance contri-
bution due to the intrinsic stochasticity of the motion de-
creases inversely proportional to the trajectory length, as
explained in detail in the SI [37]. Therefore, if stochastic-
ity of the motion is the main contribution to the variance,
doubling the length of all trajectories of a given popu-
lation of moving objects leads to 1 −S∗
new = (1 −S∗)/2,
consequently, S∗increases as S∗
new = S∗+ (1 −S∗)/2. In
the case of the polystyrene beads for instance, this would
mean that for experimental trajectories observed twice
as long as in the actual experiment, the estimated co-
variance ratio would increase from S∗= 0.53 to roughly
S∗
new = 0.76, if the spread 1 −S∗stems mainly from the
stochastic process observed over a finite time, i.e. if the
influence of other experimental factors on the parameter
spread is negligible.
III.
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS
We use the GLE eq. (1) to describe active cell mo-
tion as well as passive motion of polystyrene beads. The
objects’ motion is described by a set of GLE parame-
ters, which we extract on the single trajectory level. The
spread of these parameter distributions extracted from
the experiments is due to a combination of intrinsic dif-
ferences among the individual moving objects, the finite
trajectory length and noise in the experiment. Our sim-
ulation approach decomposes how much of the spread
actually originates from intrinsic differences between in-
dividuals of the observed population and how much stems
from the experimental finite observation time. On top
of that, it allows an estimate of how long experimental
trajectories have to be in order to reach a certain ac-
curacy level of the experimentally extracted parameter
distributions. Our method readily includes experimental
factors such as localization noise, discrete time steps and
different trajectory lengths. We confirm the robustness
of our model by applying it to data of passively mov-
ing polystyrene beads in water and to synthetic data sets
with known origin in the SI.
Compared to the polystyrene beads that are relatively
similar to each other, the cancer cells and algae cells
show significant differences within the studied popula-

tions. For the motion of the breast-cancer cells, most of
the observed spread in the mean squared velocity B and
in the persistence time τm originates from sizable intrin-
sic differences on the cell-to-cell level; this is noteworthy,
as these cells carry the same genetic material. Such phe-
notypic differences were previously observed [38] and are
connected to different levels of expressed proteins in the
cells [39]. The observed GLE parameter distribution of
algae cells turns out to almost entirely reflect intrinsic
cell-to-cell differences, which is part of the reason why
the observed GLE parameters could previously be di-
rectly used to distinguish different swimming styles of
these confined algae cells on the single cell level [12].
The usage of the GLE eq. (1) to describe active sys-
tems relies on the Gaussianity of the underlying mo-
tion process [12, 19].
In cases of non-Gaussian single-
cell velocity distributions, one could use filter approaches
that render data Gaussian [40] and then apply the same
methodology we describe in this paper.
Alternatively,
for non-Gaussian systems one could use the GLE in a
heuristic manner or use previously introduced models to
describe the organism motion [22, 41–44]. Since the GLE
eq. (1) is valid for general observables, our approach can
be applied to time-series data characterizing any organ-
10
ism or object of choice - be it active or passive.
In summary, our approach allows us to disentangle the
intrinsic individual-to-individual parameter variance of
moving objects from noise and stochastic effects.
As
every distribution of parameters extracted from exper-
iments inevitably is noisy due to finite recording time,
we anticipate various applications of our method in in-
fection biology, ecology, medicine and all other fields that
rely on the knowledge of the heterogeneity of individual
moving objects.

METHODS, EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
AND CELL PREPARATION
A.
Statistical test
In order to compare two d-dimensional distributions
ρexp(⃗z) and ρsim(⃗z) which are determined by a finite num-
ber of observations ⃗zexp
i
for ρexp and ⃗zsim
i
for ρsim, we use
a so-called permutation test [45]. We define the distance
measure
T =
d
X
i≤j
 Cov1
ij −Cov2
ij
2 ,
(10)
which measures the difference between two distributions
in terms of their covariances Cov1 and Cov2. We denote
the value of T of the distributions ρexp(⃗z) and ρsim(⃗z) by
T0.
The statistical test starts by randomly drawing sam-
ples from the joint pool of observations ⃗zexp
i
and ⃗zsim
i
,
which leads to the exchanged distributions ρexp
exch(⃗z) and
ρsim
exch(⃗z).
The exchanged distributions exhibit a new
value of T called Texch.
This process of sampling ex-
changed distributions from the joint pool of observations
is repeated nexch = 104 times, leading to 104 values of
Texch. Comparing T0 to Texch leads to the probability of
rejecting the hypothesis that the two distributions have
the same covariance, given that the hypothesis is actu-
ally true as p1 = nrej/nexch, with nrej being the number
of exchanges for which Texch > T0 [45]. We use the accep-
tance level p∗
1 = 0.05, meaning we accept the hypothesis
that the distributions ρexp(⃗z) and ρsim(⃗z) are identical in
covariance when p1 ≤p∗
1.
In practice, we extract M = 100 distributions ρsim(⃗z)
from simulations and compare each one to the experimen-
tal distribution using the statistical test described above.
This means we simulate a total of M×N trajectories. We
define p2 as the ratio of rejected distributions Mrej, where
p1 > p∗
1, to the total number of simulated distributions
p2 = Mrej/M. The hypothesis that the covariance from
simulation Covsim originates from the same intrinsic co-
variance Covinp∗as the experimental covariance Covexp
is accepted as true, if p2 ≤p∗
2, where p∗
2 is the acceptance
level. One expects the hypothesis to be rejected in aver-
age p∗
1 × M out of M times, if it is true. Therefore we
set another acceptance level p∗
2 = p∗
1 = 0.05. Results of
p2 depending on S are shown in Figs. 6b-d for different
moving objects.
B.
Discretized fit to data including localization
noise
Every experimental recording of trajectories inevitably
includes noise. In the case of cell-center trajectories the
finite pixel size, thermal and electronic fluctuations in the
camera sensors are just a few of many possible origins of
localization noise present in the trajectories. Therefore,
our fit to the experimental VACF of individual trajec-
tories needs to account for finite time discretization and
noise [16]. Here, we explain this fitting procedure. We de-
note discrete values of a function f(t) as f(i∆) = fi = f i
and the discretization time step as ∆. Velocities are com-
puted at half time steps as
vi+ 1
2 = xi+1 −xi
∆
.
(11)
From the velocities the VACF defined by eq. (3) is com-
puted according to
Ci
vv =

n −i
n−i−1
X
j=0
vj+ 1
2 vj+i+ 1
2 ,
(12)
with n being the the number of trajectory steps. In or-
der to account for localization noise, we add Gaussian
uncorrelated noise of width σloc at every time step to the
trajectory, which leads to the noisy MSD as [16]
Cnoise
MSD(t) = Ctheo
MSD(t) + 2(1 −δt0)σ2
loc ,
(13)
where Ctheo
MSD(t) is the theoretical expression for the model
MSD given by eqs. (17), (18), (20) for the different mod-
els eqs. (6), (7), (8) and δt0 is the Kronecker delta re-
flecting the uncorrelated nature of the localization noise.
Since the observed trajectories are sampled with a finite
time step ∆, we discretize the relation
Cvv(t) = 1
2
d2
dt2 CMSD(t) ,
(14)
which leads to
Cfit
vv(i∆) =
Cnoise
MSD((i + 1)∆) −2Cnoise
MSD(i∆) + Cnoise
MSD((i −1)∆)
2∆2
.
(15)
11
Finally, fits are performed by minimizing the cost func-
tion
Ecost =
n−1
X
i=0
(Cexp
vv (i∆) −Cfit
vv(i∆))2
(16)
with scipy’s least squares function in python and using
eq. (15) to determine the parameters of Cfit
vv(t). As the
MSD and VACF follow from the GLE (1) and the friction
kernel in eqs. (6),(7) or the LE in eq. (8), the parameters
to be optimized are the kernel parameters, together with
the mean squared velocity B and the localization noise
width σloc. Resulting fits are shown in Figs. 4e,h, where
the data is fitted up to 3.3 min for the cancer cells and up
to 0.2 s for the algae cells in order to disregard the noisy
part of the VACF at longer times. For the polystyrene
beads, which perform purely diffusive motion, we use eq.
(13) to fit the experimental MSD as the VACF is only
non-zero for the first two time steps. A resulting fit is
shown in Fig. 4a, where the MSD is fitted up to 0.2 s.
Before we fit the data on the individual trajectory level,
we estimate the order of magnitude of the mean squared
velocity B by Best = C0
vv for the cancer cells and algae
cells. For the freely diffusing beads we estimate the diffu-
sion coefficient D by the integral over the VACF, which
becomes Dest = C0
vv
∆
2 . Furthermore, for the cancer cells
we estimate the order of magnitude of the persistence
time τm by τ est
m
=
2
∆Γ0 . We apply boundaries for the
optimization of cancer cell parameters: B is constrained
between Best/4 and 4Best, τm between τ est
m /4 and 4τ est
m
and the localization noise width σloc between 0.01−1 µm.
For the algae cells B is assumed to lie between Best/3
and 3Best, the delta amplitude a and the oscillation am-
plitude b are assumed to lie between 0.01Γ0 and Γ0, the
memory time τ is bound between 0.05−5 s, the kernel fre-
quency Ωbetween 15 −250 Hz and the localization noise
width σloc between 0 −0.05 µm. Further, for polystyrene
beads we use bounds of 4Dest and Dest/4 for the diffusiv-
ity D and the localization noise width σloc is constrained
between 0.001 −0.2 µm. Finally, we discard fit results
for which the localization noise width σloc is close to the
boundaries and likely to be an unphysical fit result, when
σloc is smaller than 1.5 times the lower boundary or larger
than 0.99 times the upper boundary. This leads to four
discarded trajectories out of 135 total trajectories for the
breast-cancer cells, no discarded trajectories for the 23 al-
gae cells and 19 discarded trajectories out of 144 for the
polystyrene beads. For the diffusion of the polystyrene
beads we additionally discard diffusion constants above
0.8 µm2/s, which is roughly twice the theoretical value of
a sphere with radius r = 0.5 µm according to the Stokes-
Einstein law eq.
(5), which leads to four additionally
discarded trajectories.
C.
MSD expressions
The diffusion coefficient defined in eq. (5) dictates the
behavior of the MSD for pure diffusion as
CMSD(t) = 2Dt .
(17)
In the case of the PRW the MSD takes the form
CMSD(t) = 2Bτm

,
(18)
where the diffusion constant is given by D = Bτm and
the VACF follows a single exponential decay
Cvv(t) = Be−t/τm .

Polystyrene beads
Materials:
Fluorescently labeled polystyrene beads
(diameter:
1000 nm, excitation wavelength:
505 nm,
emission wavelength: 515 nm) were purchased from Ther-
moFisher Scientific (order number:
F8776).
For sin-
gle particle tracking experiments, the beads are diluted
1:1000 in deionized water and sonicated for five min-
utes at room temperature.
Afterwards, 8 µl of bead-
containing solution is injected into polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) microwells, which are formed on glass cover slips
as described previously [46].
Imaging: Single-particle tracking of the fluorescently
labeled polystyrene beads is performed using a Nikon
Ti-E Eclipse fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Düsseldorf,
Germany), which is equipped with focus stabilization,
a white light source (Prior Lumen 200; Prior Scientific,
Cambridge, UK) and an Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera
(Oxford Instruments, Oxford, UK). Fluorescence exci-
tation and emission is controlled using a GFP filter set
(Nikon GFP-1828A; EX 482/18, DM 495, BA 520/28).
The beads are imaged using a 100x Plan-Apo oil immer-
sion objective (numerical aperture: 1.45) and the follow-
ing setting of the sCMOS camera: 2 × 2 binning, 10 ms
exposure time, acquisition rate of 50.41 frames per sec-
ond at a field of view of 1024×1024 pixel2, corresponding
to 133.12 × 133.12 µm2.
Image analysis:
Single particle tracking analysis is
performed as previously described [47].
In brief, the
12
beads are detected by a local maximum of the fluores-
cence intensity and only considered for further analy-
sis, if the corresponding intensity value exceeds a user-
defined threshold, which is chosen slightly above the level
of readout noise of the sCMOS camera. The center po-
sition of each detected bead is determined by fitting a
two-dimensional Gaussian distribution to its intensity
distribution.
Trajectories are generated by a nearest-
neighbor linking scheme involving a distance threshold
as described previously [48]. Finally, as convection of the
aqueous solution (contained in the PDMS wells) cannot
be ruled out even for these relatively small wells, the bead
trajectories are corrected for the potential occurrence of
convection-based distortions of bead motion. Convection
affects the displacements of all beads in the same way
and there is no further source of motional correlation
for these randomly moving beads, except for hydrody-
namic interactions, which are weak for the high dilution
of beads employed here [49].
The convection is deter-
mined (i) by calculating the displacements of all beads
between consecutive frames, followed (ii) by calculating
the average value of all obtained two-dimensional dis-
placement vectors and finally (iii) by integrating all av-
erage displacement vector values from the first to the last
frame (whereas the average displacement vector between
the first two frames is set to zero). This running integral
yields an estimate for the convection-based motion of the
aqueous solution, which we subtract from the position of
the beads to correct the trajectories for convection.

Breast-cancer cells
Micropatterning: The human breast-cancer cells of the
cell line MDA-MBA-231 in our experiments move on one-
dimensional lanes that are produced by coating with fi-
bronectin (FN). We transfer fibronectin (FN) (YO Pro-
teins, Ronninge, Sweden) to an imaging dish featuring
a polymer coverslip bottom (ibidi, Gräfelfing, Germany)
using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps with a 15 µm
wide lane pattern. The microcontact printing protocol,
including the fabrication of the PDMS stamps, has been
detailed previously [50].
Cell culture: We culture MDA-MB-231 cells that had
been stably transduced with histone-2B mCherry (gift
from Timo Betz, University of Göttingen, Germany) in
Leibovitz’s CO2-buffered L-15 medium with 2 mM Glu-
tamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
at 37◦C. The growth medium was supplemented by 10 %
fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher) and cells were pas-
saged every 2-3 days using Accutase (Thermo Fisher).
For experiments, we seeded about 5000 cells per dish.
After incubation for 2-3 h, cells adhered to the micropat-
terns and we exchanged the medium.
Microscopy: The microscopy images, see for instance
Fig. 1b, originate from time-lapse imaging on an inverted
fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti, Nikon, Tokyo,
Japan) outfitted with an XY-motorized stage, Perfect
Focus System (Nikon), and a heating chamber (Okolab,
Pozzuoli, Italy) maintained at 37◦C. We set up an ac-
quisition protocol to sequentially scan and image fields
of view employing the motorized stage, the Perfect Fo-
cus System, a 10 CFI Plan Fluor DL objective (Nikon),
a CMOS camera (PCO edge 4.2, Excelitas PCO, Kel-
heim, Germany) and the acquisition software NIS Ele-
ments (Nikon). Prior to the time-lapse measurement, we
obtain epifluorescence images of the FN patterns. Sub-
sequently, we capture phase-contrast images of the cells
and epifluorescence images of their nuclei at 20 s intervals
for a total of 48 h.
Image analysis: In order to obtain trajectories from
the microscopy data of the fluorescently labeled cell nu-
clei, we employ MATLAB [51] scripts built upon previous
work [27] for image analysis. Here, the geometric center
of the fluorescently labeled nucleus is used as the cell po-
sition. Detection of FN lanes is accomplished through
a Hough transformation of the fluorescence signal from
labeled FN. Tracking of nuclei positions involves setting
a threshold after applying a background correction and a
band-pass filter to fluorescent images of the nuclei. The
position of the nuclei is adjusted to ensure that the po-
sition aligns with the FN lanes such that nuclei center
positions cannot be extracted offside of the FN lane.

Algae cells
Wild-type
Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii
cells
are
recorded in two-dimensional confinement between two
anti-adhesively coated glass plates with separation of
roughly 10 µm by high-speed video microscopy (Olym-
pus IX83/IX73) at 500 frames per second with a 40x
phase-contrast objective (Olympus, 0.65 NA, Plan N,
PH2) connected to a metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
camera (Phantom Miro C110, Vision Research, pixel size
= 5.6 µm). Trajectories of the algae cells are extracted by
binarizing the image sequences with appropriate thresh-
old parameters and tracking their centers using standard
MATLAB routines [51]. More experimental details are
given in [12, 29]. The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells
were previously shown to exhibit two distinct swimming
styles [12], only data of cells with synchronous flagella
motion is considered in this work.
The studied algae
cells originate from multiple isolated colonies and, hence,
are genetically heterogeneous.

FIG. S1. Average velocity distribution of all moving objects for the beads (a), cancer cells (b), algae
(c). The black symbols correspond to the averages shown in Fig. 2b,e,h and result from rescaling
with respect to individual trajectory means vind and standard deviations σind according to the black
x-axis label. Red symbols result from rescaling by the population mean v and standard deviation
σ according to eq. (S1). The dashed cyan line represents the standard normal distribution.
I.
AVERAGING VELOCITIES OVER POPULATIONS CAN RESULT IN NON-
GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS
We show in the main text that the velocity distributions of the considered moving objects
are Gaussian on the single-individual level in Fig. 2. Even though all moving objects exhibit
Gaussian distributions on the individual level, averaging over the entire population can lead
to non-Gaussian effects. In Fig. S1 we show that averaging with respect to the population
mean velocity v and the population standard deviation σ according to
v = (vind −v)/σ
(S1)
can lead to deviations from Gaussian behavior. These deviations are negligible for the beads
shown in Fig. S1a. For the cancer cells deviations from Gaussian behavior are slightly
increased when using eq. (S1) compared to the rescaling on the individual level, as shown
in Fig. S1b. For the algae cells the deviations from Gaussian behavior are quite drastic,
when rescaling according to eq. (S1). The results of Fig. S1 showcase that it is important
to analyze motility data on the single-individual level and that averaging of quantities over
individual moving objects can lead to non-Gaussian effects.

MEMORY KERNEL EXTRACTION
Multiplying the GLE eq. (1) by the initial velocity ˙x(t0), averaging over the random force
and integrating from t0 to t leads to
(Cvv(t) −Cvv(0)) = −
Z t
0
Cvv(s)G(t −s)ds ,
(S2)
where we used that ⟨˙x(t0)FR(t)⟩= 0 [30–32], set t0 = 0 and introduced the integral kernel
G(t) =
Z t
0
Γ(s)ds .
(S3)
In order to invert eq. (S2), we discretize it. Since Cvv(t) is even while G(t) is odd, we
discretize G(t) on half steps and Cvv(t) on full steps and obtain [16]
Gi+1/2 = 2(C0
vv −Ci+1

(S4)
The kernel Γi is obtained by the discrete derivative Γi =
Gi+1/2+Gi−1/2
∆
with the initial value
Γ0 = 2G1/2/∆.
III.
GOODNESS OF FIT TO INDIVIDUAL TRAJECTORY DATA
In Fig. 4 of the main text we show single-trajectory fit results of the models eqs. (6),
(7), (8) to randomly chosen single trajectory data. Since we cannot show the fit results of
all individuals, we instead show the distribution of R2 values for all fits in Fig. S2. Here,
R2 is defined using the cost function Ecost of eq. (16) as
R2 = 1 −
Ecost
Pn−1
i=0 (Cexp
vv (i∆) −Cexp
vv )2 ,
(S5)
where Cexp
vv denotes the mean value of the VACF over the n fitted time steps. Therefore, R2
gives an estimate for the goodness of the fit, where a value of zero corresponds to a bad fit
that is equivalent to assuming the function to be the mean everywhere and a value of one
corresponds to perfect agreement between the fit and the data.
Naturally, for noisy data obtained from experiments, there is some spread in the R2
values, as shown in Fig. S2. Nevertheless, it can be seen that most of the R2 values of
our extraction are close to one, thus indicating that our different fit models describe the

(c).
respective data accurately on the individual trajectory level. To further undermine this
point, we show the fit results with the highest R2 value for the respective individuals in Fig.
S3. Here, the data agrees perfectly with the fit results. The R2 values of the respective fits
for the randomly chosen individuals in Figs. 4a,e,h are 1.000, 0.964, 0.953.

EFFECTIVE KERNEL FOLLOWS UNIQUELY FROM CORRELATION FUNC-

as the objects with the highest R2 value, which is given in the respective plot. The red lines denote
the fit result.
Equating the non-equilibrium and the surrogate VACF with ΓR(t)/B = Γv(| t |) = Γ(| t |)
leads to

| ˜Γ+(ω) + iω |2 .
(S10)
Multiplying eq. (1) by v(t0), inserting Γ(|t|) = ΓR(t)/B = Γv(|t|) and averaging the
entire equation leads to the Volterra equation
d

Z t

Γ(t −s)Cvv(s)ds ,
(S11)
where we used that the random force is not correlated with the initial velocity at the pro-
jection time, i.e. ⟨v(t0)FR(t)⟩= 0, and set t0 = 0. For a given Γ(t) one can find a solution
of eq. (S11) in terms of Cvv(t). Inversely, for given correlation function Cvv(t) one can solve
eq. (S11) in terms of the friction kernel Γ(t) by Laplace transformation. With the definition
5
of the Laplace transform of a function f(t)
ˆf(q) =
Z ∞
0
f(t)e−qtdt,
(S12)
the unique solution for Γ(t) in Laplace space is given by
ˆΓ(q) =
 
Cvv(0)
ˆCvv(q)
−q
!
.
(S13)
The existence of a unique friction kernel for any given input correlation function Cvv(t)
assures that one can always find an effective friction kernel Γ(t) that, when employed in the
GLE and using Γ(|t|) = ΓR(t)/B = Γv(|t|), reproduces the two-point correlation functions.
Thus, every non-equilibrium model described by eq. (1) with ΓR(t)/B ̸= Γv(|t|) can be
mapped on an effective model with Γ(|t|) = ΓR(t)/B = Γv(|t|) determined by eq. (S13),
because the Green’s function, which completely describes a Gaussian process, is solely given
in terms of the positional two-point correlation function [12, 35].

BEAD RADIUS VARIANCE DETERMINED BY ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY
In order to estimate the bead radius variance independently of the motion in water, we
determine the radius variance from 220 beads via atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
radius distribution is shown in Fig. S4, where the mean radius is ⟨r⟩= 0.51 µm and the
standard deviation is ∆r = 0.02 µm. This is in line with the values of ⟨r⟩= 0.50 µm and
standard deviation ∆r = 25 nm provided by the manufacturer. These values agree with the
estimated radius variance from the motility data in the main text of ∆r = 86 ± 63 nm.
The sample of beads is prepared on freshly cleaved mica. Before the AFM measurement
the beads (FluoSpheres NeutrAvidin-Labeled Microspheres, 1.0 µm ThermoFisher Scientific)
are diluted 1:100 in deionized water and sonicated for 10 min to reduce bead aggregation.
The sample was then left to dry overnight. AFM images are obtained using a MultiMode
8 atomic force microscope (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) with a Nanoscope V controller and
NanoScope software. Imaging is performed with TappingMode in air using AC160TS can-
tilevers (Asylum Research by Oxford Instruments, LOT#753014). The AFM images with
a frame size of 10 µm × 10 µm are recorded at a scan rate of 1 Hz over 256 lines, with an
integral gain of 5 and proportional gain of 10, without z-limit.

LEAST-SQUARE FIT PARAMETER DISTRIBUTIONS OF NOISY EXPO-
NENTIALS: THE MEDIAN IS MORE ACCURATE THAN THE MEAN
In Fig. S5 we show the fit results of 105 least-square fits to the noisy function
f(t) = α0e−β0t + γ0 + ζ(t)
(S14)
with the fit function
f fit(t) = αe−βt + γ ,
(S15)
where ζ(t) describes Gaussian noise with zero mean ⟨ζ(t)⟩= 0 and variance ⟨ζ(0)ζ(t) =
5δ(t). The form of eq. (S14) is motivated by the fact that VACFs often contain exponen-
tially decaying components. Since our model invokes fitting to VACFs with exponential
components with a least-square fit according to eq. (16) in the main text, here, we discuss
the resulting parameter distributions of such fits. The distribution of fitted values for the
exponential prefactor α and the constant γ are well described by Gaussian distributions, see
Figs. S5a,c, whereas the distribution of the exponential factor β is better described by a
log-normal distribution, as shown in Fig. S5b, which has the form
p(β) = exp(−(ln(β)−ln(βmed))2
2σ2
)
βσ

(S16)
where βmed denotes the median of the distribution and σ determines the width of the dis-
tribution.

FIG. S5. Distributions of fitted parameters (a) α, (b) β, (c) γ of 105 fits of eq. (S15) to data sets of
eq. (S14) with input parameters α0 = 20, β0 = 20, γ0 = 8, ⟨ζ(0)ζ(t) = 5δ(t) for t between 0 −100
in steps of 0.1. The mean and median of the data are presented as vertical lines and are given by
⟨α⟩= 19.98, αmed = 20.00, ⟨β⟩= 34.18, βmed = 19.98, ⟨γ⟩= 8.00, γmed = 8.00.
It turns out that the actual input parameter of β0 = 20 is better described by the median
of the distribution of fitted parameters compared to the mean, which we show in Fig. S5b.
For the parameters α and γ the median and mean describe the actual input parameters
equally well, as seen in Fig. S5a,c. As the median accurately describes the true value of
Gaussian distributed parameters as well as Log-normal distributed parameters from least-
squares fits, we choose it as a representation of the center of distributions rather than the
mean.
VII.
ANALYTICAL ESTIMATION OF PARAMETER VARIANCE
We compare our parameter variance estimate from simulations with analytical estimates.
As an example, we estimate the mean squared velocity B = ⟨v2⟩= Cvv(0) using the PRW
model eq. (7). Due to our extraction of the model parameters from the VACF eq. (15),
the statistical error of the parameters relates closely to the statistical error of the VACF.
We consider a trajectory composed of n + 1 = L/∆positions which produces a VACF with
n values, where the mean squared velocity of the continuous trajectory is estimated by the
finite difference velocities eq. (11) as
Best = 1
n
n
X
i=1
v2
i .
(S17)
8
Here, it should be noted that this estimate deviates from the estimation of our fit model
including localization noise effects eq.
(15).
Especially in cases with localization noise,
the estimate Best in eq. (S17) overestimates the true value of B as displacements are on
average increased by the noise. On the other hand, a finite time step discretization leads
to decreased values Best, as a finite time step does not capture instantaneous velocities but
rather an average over the interval of the time step. Our extraction of parameters by a least
squares fit of eq. (15) accounts for discretization and localization noise effects, but is not
analytically tractable.
The moments of v follow from the velocity distribution ρ(v) as
⟨vk⟩=
Z ∞
−∞
vkρ(v)dv .
(S18)
We want to determine the dependence of the variance of our estimation Best on the length
of the trajectories
σ2(Best) = ⟨B2
est⟩−⟨Best⟩2 .
(S19)
Inserting eq. S17 into eq. S19 leads to
σ2(Best) =
1
n2⟨Pn
i=1 v2

(S20)
=
1
n2(n⟨v4⟩+ Pn
i̸=j⟨v2

j⟩−n2⟨v2⟩2) .
If the velocities at time i and j are independent of each other, the correlation of the squared
velocities can be written as
⟨v2
i v2
j⟩= ⟨v2
i ⟩⟨v2
j⟩= ⟨v2⟩2,
(S21)
thus, the variance of Best follows as
σ2(Best) = 1
n2
 n⟨v4⟩+ n(n −1)⟨v2⟩2 −n2⟨v2⟩2 
= 1
n
 ⟨v4⟩−⟨v2⟩2
.
(S22)
In fact, the assumption of uncorrelated squared velocities is not true for most experimental
trajectories, indicated by the non-zero values of the VACF for t > 0, meaning one needs to
consider the correlation between the squared velocities over time. This results in a different
estimate for the variance of Best [37], which can be written as
σ2(Best) = 1
n(⟨v4⟩−⟨v2⟩2
(S23)
+ 2
n−1
X
k=1
(1 −k/n)⟨v2
0v2
k⟩) ,
9
where we used that the correlation function only depends on time differences k = |i−j| and
that the kth term ⟨v2
0v2
k⟩occurs n −k times in the sum. If one does not know the analytic
form of Cv2v2(t) = ⟨v2(0)v2(t)⟩, one can use the function obtained from the data similarly to
eq. 12 for Cvv(t), where one usually introduces a cutoff length ncut to estimate the variance
as
σ2(Best) = 1
n
 
C0
v2v2 −(C0
vv)2 + 2
ncut
X
k=1
Ck

!
(S24)
in order to avoid using the estimated correlation function for large times t > ncut∆, where
the noise is stronger due to less averaging, see eq. 12. Similarly to the VACF eq. (19) one
can calculate the correlation of the squared velocities for the PRW (the GLE eq. (1) with
the instantaneous friction kernel eq. (7)) starting from the formal solution for the velocity
v(t) = v(0)e−t/τm +
Z t
0
FR(s)e−(t−s)/τmds .
(S25)
The squared velocity correlation function then takes the form
⟨v2(0)v2(t)⟩=
*
v2(0)
"
v2(0)e−2t/τm + 2v(0)e−t/τm

Z t

.
(S26)
Inserting the first and second moment of the random force ⟨FR(s)⟩= 0 and ⟨FR(s)FR(s′)⟩=
2Bδ(s −s′)/τm respectively and evaluating the integrals, one finds
⟨v2(0)v2(t)⟩= 3⟨v2(0)⟩2e−2t/τm + B⟨v2(0)⟩
 1 −e−2t/τm
,
(S27)
where we used that the fourth moment of a Gaussian is ⟨v(0)4⟩= 3⟨v2(0)⟩2. Now inserting
⟨v2(0)⟩= B yields
Cv2v2(t) = B2(1 + 2e−2t/τm) .
(S28)
In Fig. S6a we show extracted PRW parameter distributions from simulations with identi-
cal input parameters for different trajectory lengths L, where one can clearly see the variance
decreasing for increasing trajectory length. In Figs. S6b-d this decrease is presented for dif-
ferent localization noise widths σloc. The analytic prediction for uncorrelated velocities eq.
(S22) shown as black dashed line in Figs. S6b-d is clearly below the observed variance, since
the velocities in the PRW are intrinsically correlated, but correctly describes the powerlaw
dependence on L. For increasing localization noise, the relative variance σ2(B)/B2 decreases
for Best (crosses in Figs. S6b-d), because the mean increases by

(b)-(d) The variance of the

respective mean values of the two different estimates of B for trajectory length L/∆= 4 × 104
are given in the upper right corner. The black dashed line represents the expected variance for
uncorrelated data given in eq. (S22) and the cyan line the expected variance given by eq. (S24)
using the analytical result for the correlation function given in eq. (S28) with ncut = n = L/∆−1.
As dictated by the law of large numbers, the variance is inversely proportional to the number of
data points, i.e. inversely proportional to the trajectory length L.
11
which follows directly from eq. (15) of the main text. The approximation in the latter part
of eq. (S29) is accurate when the time step is smaller than the length of the ballistic regime
in the MSD; in the case of the PRW, this means it is exact for ∆< τm. The localization
noise increases the estimation of the mean squared velocity, as seen in eq. (S29) and it
leads to a decorrelation of consecutive velocities, as seen for instance in Figs. 4e,f in the
main text by the dip in the VACF at t = ∆. Therefore, the estimator Best eq. (S17) comes
closer to the prediction for uncorrelated velocities for increasing localization noise, as seen
by comparing the crosses in Fig. S6a to the crosses in Fig. S6b and c.
The mean of Best according to eq. (S17) is shown in the upper right corner of Figs. S6b-d,
which increases with increasing localization noise as expected from eq. (S29). Here, we also
show that B determined by our fit of eq. (16), denoted by Bfit, gives accurate estimates close
to the input value of B even for high localization noise width σloc. Moreover, the variance
Bfit, shown as circles in Figs. S6b-d, is close to the analytical estimate for σ(Best) according
to eq. (S24), shown as the cyan line in Figs. S6b-d. However, this close match is not
guarantied for arbitrary models, since the derivation cannot be done analytically for non-
linear fit models, such as our fit by eq. (16). Additionally, estimating the parameter variance
of a trajectory ensemble of different trajectory lengths L further complicates the matter.
All these complications are avoided by estimating the parameter variance by simulating the
underlying process based on the GLE eq. (1), where all experimental settings, such as time
step, different trajectory lengths and localization noise, can easily be included, as explained
in the main text.
VIII.
TEST METHOD WITH KNOWN ORIGIN PARAMETER DISTRIBUTION
In order to show, that the statistical test explained in the Methods actually results in
correct estimates for the cell-to-cell variance, we use a synthetic parameter distribution of
known origin. For the PRW model eq. (7) the parameter vector has three entries ⃗z =
(τm, B, σloc), so we start by drawing N parameter vectors from a Gaussian distribution
with known covariance

and mean
⟨⃗z⟩= (10 min, 1.25 µm2/min2, 0.1 µm) ,
(S31)
where the mean is in the order of the parameters exhibited by the cancer cells as seen in Fig.
5e. For clarity we omit the units of the covariance in eq. (S30). A Gaussian distribution with
covariance given by eq. (S30) and mean given by eq. (S31) is shown as violet empty symbols
in Fig. S7a. We show the axes in Fig. S7 in relative units because this way the results are
better comparable across different systems with different units and the simulation results
only vary if the ratios of parameters change. Now, we simulate a trajectory for each of the
N parameter vectors ⃗z of this known distribution of length L = 100 ∆with ∆= 0.5 min,
which is a typical length for single-cell tracking data.
In order to obtain the correct continuous time behavior, we simulate trajectories with
a much smaller time step than the discretization of the trajectories with h = 0.05∆and
then obtain trajectories by using only every ∆/h = 20th step of the simulation and adding
localization noise drawn from the Gaussian distribution of width σloc. For simulations of the
algae cells we use h = 0.005∆. The extracted parameters from these simulated trajectories
are denoted by the blue symbols shown in Fig. S7a. Since we know the exact distribution
that led to this extracted parameter distribution, we can now test whether our method
reproduces the spread of the original distribution. The ratio S defined in eq. (9) of the
input covariance Covinp∗to the covariance of the distribution extracted from the synthetic
data, here denoted as Covexp, is S = 0.11. Indeed we find that the estimated covariance
ratio using the statistical test introduced in the Methods is S∗= 0.17 ± 0.08. An exemplary
distribution with S = 0.1 is shown in Fig. S7b as empty green triangles and agrees well
with the true original distribution shown as empty violet pentagons. Hence, the distribution
extracted from simulations using the empty green triangles in Fig. S7b shown in Fig. S7c
(red triangles) agrees with the distribution extracted from the synthetic data (blue symbols).
We note that if the type of the underlying distribution is known, one can easily adapt the
method to use an input distribution different from a Gaussian distribution. Nevertheless, in
the most common case where the distribution type is not known, the Gaussian approach is
most likely to describe the distribution.
Additionally, we create synthetic distributions of N = 100 PRW trajectories originating
all from the same parameter vector B∆2/σ2
loc = 80, τm/∆= 25 close to the values of
the breast cancer cell data. All parameters being the same means Covinp∗= 0 and hence
